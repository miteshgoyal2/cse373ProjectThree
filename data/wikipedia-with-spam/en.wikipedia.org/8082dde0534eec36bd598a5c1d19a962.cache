recent pittsburgh penguins the stanley cup french la coupe stanley is the championship trophy awarded annually to the national hockey league nhl playoff winner it is the oldest existing trophy to be awarded to a professional sports franchise and the international ice hockey federation iihf considers it to be one of the most important championships available to the sport1 originally commissioned in 1892 as the dominion hockey challenge cup the trophy is named after lord stanley of preston then–governor general of canada who donated it as an award to canadas topranking amateur ice hockey club which the entire stanley family supported with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game2 the first cup was awarded in 1893 to montreal hc and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the stanley cup in 1906 in 1915 the two professional ice hockey organizations the national hockey association nha and the pacific coast hockey association pcha reached a gentlemens agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the stanley cup after a series of league mergers and folds it was established as the de facto championship trophy of the nhl in 1926 and then the de jure nhl championship prize in 1947 there are actually three stanley cups the original bowl of the dominion hockey challenge cup the authenticated presentation cup and the replica cup on display at the hockey hall of fame the nhl has maintained effective control over both the trophy itself and its associated trademarks nevertheless the nhl does not actually own the trophy but instead uses it by agreement with the two canadian trustees of the cup3 the nhl has registered trademarks associated with the name and likeness of the stanley cup although the leagues right to outright own trademarks associated with a trophy it does not own has been disputed by some legal experts4 the original bowl was made of silver and is 185 centimetres 728 inches in height and 29 centimetres 1142 inches in diameter the current stanley cup topped with a copy of the original bowl is made of a silver and nickel alloy it has a height of 8954 centimetres 3525 inches and weighs 155 kilograms 345 lb 2 st 6½ lb5 unlike the trophies awarded by the other major professional sports leagues of north america a new stanley cup is not made each year originally the winners kept it until a new champion was crowned currently winning teams get the stanley cup during the summer and a limited number of days during the season it is unusual among trophies to include winning members names every year since 1924 a select portion of the winning players coaches management and club staff names are engraved on its bands however there is not enough room to include all the players and nonplayers so some names must be omitted initially a new band added each year though this caused the trophy to grow in size earning the nickname stovepipe cup in 1958 the modern onepiece cup was designed with a fiveband barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band to prevent the stanley cup from growing when the bottom band is full the oldest band is removed and preserved in the hockey hall of fame and a new blank band added to the bottom it has been referred to as the cup lord stanleys cup the holy grail or facetiously chiefly by sportswriters as lord stanleys mug6 the stanley cup is surrounded by numerous legends and traditions the oldest of which is the celebratory drinking of champagne out of the cup by the winning team since the 1914–15 season the cup has been won a combined 101 times by 18 active nhl teams and five defunct teams it was not awarded in 1919 because of a spanish flu epidemic and in 2005 as a consequence of the 2004–05 nhl lockout during the challenge cup era from 1893 to 1914 the cup was held by nine different teams the montreal canadiens have won the cup a record 24 times and are the most recent canadianbased team to win the cup having won it in 1993 while the detroit red wings have won the cup 11 times the most of any united states based nhl team

of preston after the lord stanley of preston was appointed by queen victoria as governor general of canada on june 11 1888 he and his family became highly enthusiastic about ice hockey7 stanley was first exposed to the game at montreals 1889 winter carnival where he saw the montreal victorias play the montreal hockey club8 the montreal gazette reported that he expressed his great delight with the game of hockey and the expertise of the players7 during that time organized ice hockey in canada was still in its infancy and only montreal and ottawa had anything resembling leagues7 stanleys entire family became active in ice hockey two of his sons arthur and algernon formed a new team called the ottawa rideau hall rebels9 arthur also played a key role in the formation of what later became known as the ontario hockey association oha and would go on to be the founder of ice hockey in great britain10 arthur and algernon persuaded their father to donate a trophy to be an outward and visible sign of the hockey championship9 stanley sent the following message to the victory celebration held on march 18 1892 at ottawas russell hotel for the threetime champion ottawa hockey club71112 i have for some time been thinking that it would be a good thing if there were a challenge cup which should be held from year to year by the champion hockey team in the dominion of canada there does not appear to be any such outward sign of a championship at present and considering the general interest which matches now elicit and the importance of having the game played fairly and under rules generally recognized i am willing to give a cup which shall be held from year to year by the winning team i am not quite certain that the present regulations governing the arrangement of matches give entire satisfaction and it would be worth considering whether they could not be arranged so that each team would play once at home and once at the place where their opponents hail from11 soon afterwards stanley purchased what is frequently described as a decorative punch bowl but which silver expert john culme identified as a rose bowl13 made in sheffield england and sold by london silversmith g r collis and company now boodle and dunthorne jewellers for ten guineas equal to ten and a half pounds sterling us4867 which is equal to 1297 in 2016 dollars714 he had the words dominion hockey challenge cup engraved on one side of the outside rim and from stanley of preston on the other side15 originally stanley intended that the cup should be awarded to the top amateur hockey team in canada to be decided by the acceptance of a challenge from another team he made five preliminary regulations712 the winners shall return the cup in good order when required by the trustees so that it may be handed over to any other team which may win it each winning team at its own expense may have the club name and year engraved on a silver ring fitted on the cup the cup shall remain a challenge cup and should not become the property of one team even if won more than once the trustees shall maintain absolute authority in all situations or disputes over the winner of the cup if one of the existing trustees resigns or drops out the remaining trustee shall nominate a substitute the first stanley cup champions the montreal hockey club affiliated with the montreal amateur athletic association stanley appointed sheriff john sweetland and philip d ross who would serve in his post an unsurpassed 56 years as trustees of the cup sweetland and ross first presented the trophy in 1893 to the montreal amateur athletic association on behalf of the affiliated montreal hockey club the champions of the amateur hockey association of canada ahac since they defeated all comers during the late season including the champions of the ontario association ottawa16 sweetland and ross also believed that the ahac was the top league and as firstplace finishers in the ahac montreal was the best team in canada17 naturally the ottawas were upset by the decision because there had been no challenge games scheduled and because the trustees failed to convey the rules on how the cup was to be awarded prior to the start of the season17 as a result the cup trustees issued more specific rules on how the trophy should be defended and awarded1819 the cup is automatically awarded to the team that wins the title of the previous cup champions league without the need for any other special extra contest challengers for the cup must be from senior hockey associations and must have won their league championship challengers will be recognized in the order in which their request is received the challenge games where the cup could change leagues are to be decided either in a onegame affair a twogame total goals affair or a best of three series to the benefit of both teams involved all matches would take place on the home ice of the champions although specific dates and times would have to be approved by the trustees ticket receipts from the challenge games are to be split equally between both teams if the two competing clubs cannot agree to a referee the trustees will appoint one and the two teams shall cover the expenses equally if the two competing clubs cannot agree on other officials the referee will appoint them and the two clubs shall also pay the expenses equally a league could not challenge for the cup twice in one season stanley never saw a stanley cup championship game nor did he ever present the cup although his term as governor general ended in september 1893 he was forced to return to england on july 15 in april of that year his elder brother edward stanley 15th earl of derby died and stanley succeeded him as the 16th earl of derby10 challenge cup eraedit main article list of stanley cup challenge games during the challenge cup period none of the leagues that played for the trophy had a formal playoff system to decide their respective champions whichever team finished in first place after the regular season won the league title however in 1894 four teams out of the fiveteam ahac tied for the championship with records of 5–3–0 the ahac had no tiebreaking system after extensive negotiations and quebecs withdrawal from the championship competition it was decided that a threeteam tournament would take place in montreal with the ottawa team receiving a bye to the final because they were the only road team on march 17 in the first ever stanley cup playoff game the montreal hockey club montreal hc defeated the montreal victorias 3–2 five days later in the first stanley cup final game montreal hc beat the ottawa hockey club 3–12021 the first stanley cup in 1895 queens university was the first official challenger for the cup although it was controversial the montreal victorias had won the league title and thus the stanley cup but the challenge match was between the previous years champion montreal hc and the university squad the trustees decided that if the montreal hc won the challenge match the victorias would become the stanley cup champions the montreal hc won the match 5–1 and their crosstown rivals were crowned the champions22 the first successful challenge to the cup came the next year by the winnipeg victorias the champions of the manitoba hockey league on february 14 1896 the winnipeg squad defeated the champions 2–0 and became the first team outside the ahac to win the cup23 as the prestige of winning the cup grew so did the need to attract top players only nine months after winning the cup in march 1906 the montreal wanderers pushed through a resolution at the annual meeting of the eastern canada amateur hockey association ecaha that would allow professional players to play alongside amateurs because the ecaha was the top hockey league in canada at the time the cup trustees agreed to open the challenges to professional teams24 the first professional competition came one month later during the wanderers twogame total goals challenge series which they won 17 goals to 525 the smallest municipality to produce a stanley cup champion team is kenora ontario the town had a population of about 4000 when the kenora thistles captured the cup in january 190726 aided by future hall of famers art ross and bad joe hall the thistles defeated the montreal wanderers in a twogame total goals challenge series the thistles successfully defended the cup once against a team from brandon manitoba in march 1907 the wanderers challenged the thistles to a rematch despite an improved lineup the thistles lost the cup to montreal in 1908 the allan cup was introduced as the trophy for canadas amateurs and the stanley cup started to become a symbol of professional hockey supremacy24 in that same year the first allprofessional team the toronto trolley leaguers from the newly created ontario professional hockey league ophl competed for the cup27 one year later the montreal hc and the montreal victorias the two remaining amateur teams left the ecaha and the ecaha dropped amateur from their name to become a professional league24 in 1910 the national hockey association nha was formed the nha soon proved it was the best in canada as it kept the cup for the next four years28 prior to 1912 challenges could take place at any time given the appropriate rink conditions and it was common for teams to defend the cup numerous times during the year in 1912 cup trustees declared that it was only to be defended at the end of the champion teams regular season29 organized interleague competitionedit in 1914 the victoria aristocrats from the pacific coast hockey association pcha challenged the nha and cup champion toronto blueshirts a controversy erupted when a letter arrived from the stanley cup trustees on march 17 that the trustees would not let the stanley cup travel west as they did not consider victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees30 however on march 18 trustee william foran stated that it was a misunderstanding pcha president frank patrick had not filed a challenge because he had expected emmett quinn of the nha to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored in any case all arrangements had been ironed out and the victoria challenge was accepted3132 several days later trustee foran wrote to nha president quinn that the trustees are perfectly satisfied to allow the representatives of the three pro leagues nha pcha and maritime to make all arrangements each season as to the series of matches to be played for the cup33 one year later the nha and the pcha concluded a gentlemens agreement in which their respective champions would face each other for the cup similar to baseballs world series which is played between the american league and national league champions under the new proposal the stanley cup final series alternated between the east and the west each year with alternating games played according to nha and pcha rules34 the pchas vancouver millionaires won the 1915 series three games to none in a bestoffive series35 after the portland rosebuds an americanbased team joined the pcha in 1914 the trustees issued a statement that the cup was no longer for the best team in canada but now for the best team in the world34 ice hockey in europe was still in its infancy at this time so it was without much controversy that winners of the stanley cup began styling themselves as the world champions just like in baseball two years later the rosebuds became the first american team to play in the stanley cup final36 in 1917 the seattle metropolitans became the first american team to win the cup37 after that season the nha dissolved and the national hockey league nhl took its place34 in 1919 the spanish influenza epidemic forced the montreal canadiens and the seattle metropolitans to cancel their series marking the first time the stanley cup was not awarded38 the series was tied at 2–2–1 but the final game was never played because montreal manager george kennedy and players joe hall billy coutu jack mcdonald and newsy lalonde were hospitalized with influenza hall died four days after the cancelled game and the series was abandoned39 the format for the stanley cup final changed in 1922 with the creation of the western canada hockey league wchl three leagues competed for the cup two league champions faced each other for the right to challenge the third champion in the final series40 this lasted three seasons as the pcha and the wchl later merged to form the western hockey league whl in 192541 after winning in the 1924–25 season the victoria cougars became the last team outside the nhl to win the stanley cup42 nhl takes overedit see also stanley cup playoffs and stanley cup finals after winning the cup players traditionally skate around holding the trophy above their heads as pavel datsyuk of the detroit red wings does here when the red wings captured their 11th cup in 2008 the whl folded in 1926 and was quickly replaced by the prairie hockey league however in the meantime the nhl which had only entered the us two years before bought up the contracts of most of the whls players and largely used them to stock the rosters of three new us teams in what would turn out to be its most significant expansion of its preoriginal six era the chicago blackhawks detroit red wings and new york rangers joined the nhl with the nhl now firmly established in the largest markets of the northeastern united states and with the western teams having been stripped of their best players the phl was deemed to be a minor league unworthy of challenging the nhl for hockey supremacy the phl lasted only two seasons over the next two decades other leagues and clubs occasionally issued challenges but none were accepted by the cups trustees since 1926 no nonnhl team has played for the cup leading it to become the de facto championship trophy of the nhl4143 in addition with no major professional hockey league left to challenge it the nhl began calling its league champions the world champions notwithstanding the lack of any interleague championship in doing so the nhl copied a policy that had been adopted by the then stillfledgling national football league from its start in 1920 and which the national basketball association would also assert upon its founding in 1946 finally in 1947 the nhl reached an agreement with trustees p d ross and cooper smeaton to grant control of the cup to the nhl allowing the league to reject challenges from other leagues that may have wished to play for the cup434445 the trustees hereby delegate to the league full authority to determine and amend from time to time the conditions for competition of the stanley cup including the qualifications of challengers the appointment of officials the apportionment and distribution of all gate receipts provided always that the winners of this trophy shall be the acknowledged worlds professional hockey champions the trustees agree that during the currency of this agreement they will not acknowledge or accept any challenge for the stanley cup unless such a challenge is in conformity with the condition specified in paragraph one 1 thereof the league undertakes the responsibility for the care and safe custody of the stanley cup including all necessary repairs and alterations to the cup and substructure as may be required from time to time and further undertakes to insure the stanley cup for its full insurable value the league hereby acknowledges itself to be bound to the trustees in the sum of one thousand dollars which bond is conditioned upon the safe return of the stanley cup to the trustees in accordance with the terms of this agreement and it is agreed that the league shall have the right to return the trophy to the trustees at any time this agreement shall remain in force so long as the league continues to be the worlds leading professional hockey league as determined by its playing caliber and in the event of dissolution or other termination of the national hockey league the stanley cup shall revert to the custody of the trustees in the event of default in the appointment of a new trustee by the surviving trustee the trustees hereby delegate and appoint the governors of the international hockey hall of fame in kingston ontario to name two canadian trustees to carry on under the terms of the original trust and in conformity with this agreement and it is further mutually agreed that any disputes arising as to the interpretation of this agreement or the facts upon which such interpretation is made shall be settled by an arbitration board of three one member to be appointed by each of the parties and the third to be selected by the two appointees the decision of the arbitration board shall be final19 this agreement was amended on november 22 1961 substituting the governors of the international hockey hall of fame in kingston ontario with the committee of the hockey hall of fame in toronto ontario as the group that would name the two canadian trustees if need be in the 1970s the world hockey association sought to challenge for the cup by this time all cup trustees were longtime nhl loyalists and under the direction of nhl president clarence campbell the whas challenge for the cup was blocked however notwithstanding the aforementioned legal obligation the nhl considering not only the whas presence but also the rising caliber of european ice hockey leagues quietly discontinued calling its champions the world champions nevertheless the nhl came under pressure to allow its champion to play the wha champion eventually following the establishment of the canada cup as the first bestonbest international hockey tournament nhl president clarence campbell who was a vocal opponent of the tournament made public overtures to establish a true world professional championship in ice hockey just like the world series46 under campbells proposal the nhl champion would have played the wha champion for the right to face the european champion campbells two main conditions were that stanley cup was to remain the nhls championship trophy and that the world championship would be strictly limited to professional teams the latter condition was the more contentious one as it would have caused problems especially for eastern bloc teams wanting to challenge for such a championship – these teams employed various legal fictions to maintain the nominal amateur status of their top players the nhls critics questioned the seriousness of campbells idea and argued that nhl owners had no intention of ever playing for a world championship the international ice hockey federation soon made clear that it would never sanction any sort of world championship in which teams from the soviet union and czechoslovakia were barred from participating and the top openly professional european leagues were unwilling to consider taking part in any tournament not sanctioned by the iihf in the end campbells proposal went nowhere – eventually the nhl resolved the wha challenge by agreeing to merge with its rival by which time the older league had quietly withdrawn its support for the idea neither the nhl nor any other professional hockey league makes a claim to its champions being the world champions the cup was awarded every year until 2005 when a labour dispute between the nhls owners and the nhl players association the union that represents the players led to the cancellation of the 2004–05 season as a result no cup champion was crowned for the first time since the flu pandemic in 1919 the lockout was controversial among many fans who questioned whether the nhl had exclusive control over the cup a website known as freestanleycom since closed was launched asking fans to write to the cup trustees and urge them to return to the original challenge cup format47 adrienne clarkson then governor general of canada alternately proposed that the cup be presented to the top womens hockey team in lieu of the nhl season this idea was so unpopular that the clarkson cup was created instead meanwhile a group in ontario also known as the wednesday nighters filed an application with the ontario superior court claiming that the cup trustees had overstepped their bounds in signing the 1947 agreement with the nhl and therefore must award the trophy regardless of the lockout48 on february 7 2006 a settlement was reached in which the trophy could be awarded to nonnhl teams should the league not operate for a season the dispute lasted so long that by the time it was settled the nhl had resumed operating for the 2005–06 season and the stanley cup went unclaimed for the 2004–05 season45 furthermore when another nhl lockout commenced in 2012 the trustees stated that the 2006 agreement did not oblige them to award the cup in the event of a lost season and that they were likely to reject any nonnhl challenges for the cup in the event the 2012–13 season were cancelled which it was not4 in 2007 the international ice hockey federation iihf formalized the triple gold club the group of players and coaches who have won an olympic games gold medal a world championship gold medal and the stanley cup495051 the term had first entered popular use following the 2002 winter olympics which saw the addition of the first canadian members525354 trusteesedit the regulations set down by lord stanley call for two trustees who had the sole joint right to govern the cup and the conditions of its awarding until 1947 when they ceded control to the nhl while the original regulations allow for a

closeup view of the engraving for the 2001 champion colorado avalanche like the grey cup awarded to the winner of the canadian football league the stanley cup is engraved with the names of the winning players coaches management and club staff however this was not always the case one of lord stanleys original conditions was that each team could at their own expense add a ring to the cup to commemorate their victory712 initially there was only one base ring which was attached to the bottom of the original bowl by the montreal hockey club clubs engraved their team names usually in the form team name year won on that one ring until it was full in 1902 with no more room to engrave their names and unwilling to pay for a second band teams left their mark on the bowl itself the 1907 montreal wanderers became the first club to record their name on the bowls interior surface and the first champion to record the name of every member of their team55 in 1908 for reasons unknown the wanderers despite having turned aside four challengers did not record their names on the cup the next year the ottawa senators added a second band onto the cup despite the new room the 1910 wanderers and the 1911 senators did not put their names on the cup the 1915 vancouver millionaires became the second team to engrave players names this time inside the bowl along its sides55 the 1918 millionaires eventually filled the band added by the 1909 senators55 the 1915 ottawa senators the 1916 portland rosebuds and the 1918 vancouver millionaires all engraved their names on the trophy even though they did not officially win it under the new pchanha system they had only won the title of the previous champions league and would have been crowned as cup champions under the old challenge rules the winners in 1918 1920 to 1923 did not put their winning team name on it56 syl apps with the stovepipe cup before it was redesigned in the 1940s the stanley cup acknowledges the cancelled 2004–05 season with the words 2004–05 season not played due to the lockout no further engraving occurred until 1924 when the canadiens added a new band to the cup55 since then engraving the team and its players has been an unbroken annual tradition originally a new band was added each year causing the trophy to grow in size the stovepipe cup as it was nicknamed because of its resemblance to the exhaust pipe of a stove became unwieldy so it was redesigned in 1948 as a twopiece cigarshaped trophy with a removable bowl and collar this cup also properly honoured those teams that did not engrave their names on the cup also included was 1918–19 no decision montreal canadiens seattle metropolitans57 since 1958 the cup has undergone several minor alterations the original collar and bowl were too brittle and were replaced in 1963 and 1969 respectively the modern onepiece cup design was introduced in 1958 when the old barrel was replaced with a fiveband barrel each of which could contain 13 winning teams58 although the bands were originally designed to fill up during the cups centennial year the names of the 1965 montreal canadiens were engraved over a larger area than allotted and thus there are 12 teams on that band instead of 1359 when the bands were all filled in 1991 the top band of the large barrel was preserved in the hockey hall of fame and a new blank band was added to the bottom so the stanley cup would not grow further59 another new band was scheduled to be added to the bottom of the cup following the 2004–05 season but was not added because of the 2004–05 nhl lockout after the 2005–06 champion carolina hurricanes were crowned and the new bottom ring was finally added the cancelled season was acknowledged with the words 2004–05 season not played60 currently the cup stands at 895 centimetres 35¼ inches tall and weighs 15½ kilograms 34½ lb5 name inscriptionsedit currently a player must have played at least half of the regular season games usually 41 in current league format for the championship team provided the player remains with the team when they win the cup or played in at least one game of the stanley cup finals however since 1994 teams have been permitted to petition the nhl commissioner to be considered on a casebycase basis to engrave a players name on the cup if the player was unavailable to play due to extenuating circumstances61 for example the detroit red wings received special permission from the nhl to inscribe the name of vladimir konstantinov whose career ended after a car accident on june 13 1997 on the stanley cup after detroit defended their title in 1998 with the montreal canadiens having won by far the most cup championships of any team the list of the players who have been engraved on the cup the most often is dominated by montreal players henri richard of the canadiens with his name engraved eleven times played on more stanley cup champions than any other player he is followed by jean beliveau and yvan cournoyer of the canadiens with ten championships claude provost of the canadiens with nine and three players tied with eight red kelly four with the red wings four with the leafs the most for any player who was not a member of the canadiens and canadiens players jacques lemaire maurice richard beliveaus name appears on the cup more than any other individual ten times as a player and seven times as management for a total of seventeen times62 twelve women have had their names engraved on the stanley cup the first woman to have her name engraved on the stanley cup is marguerite norris who won the cup as the president of the detroit red wings in 1954 and 1955 the only canadian woman to have her name engraved on the stanley cup is sonia scurfield born in hafford saskatchewan who won the

anecdotesedit july 13 2006 wounded united states marines pose with carolina hurricanes star glen wesley in orange shirt and the stanley cup main article traditions and anecdotes associated with the stanley cup there are many traditions associated with the stanley cup one of the oldest started by the 1896 winnipeg victorias dictates that the winning team drink champagne from the top bowl after their victory65 the cup is also traditionally presented on the ice to the captain of the winning team after the serieswinning game each member of the victorious club carries the trophy around the rink however this has not always been the case prior to the 1930s the cup was not awarded immediately after the victory the first time that the cup was awarded on the ice may have been to the 1932 toronto maple leafs but the practice did not become a tradition until the 1950s65 ted lindsay of the 1950 cup champion detroit red wings became the first captain upon receiving the cup to hoist it overhead and skate around the rink according to lindsay he did so to allow the fans to have a better view of the cup since then it has been a tradition for each member of the winning team beginning with the captain to take a lap around the ice with the trophy hoisted above his head65 the tradition of the captain first hoisting the cup has been breached a few times in 1993 after the montreal canadiens defeated the los angeles kings guy carbonneau handed the cup to denis savard as savard had been the player that many fans had urged the canadiens to draft back in 1980 another notable exception was in 1998 after the detroit red wings had defeated the washington capitals when steve yzerman immediately passed the cup to vladimir konstantinov whose career with the red wings ended due to serious injuries in a traffic accident the previous year and had to be wheeled on the ice the third was involving joe sakic and ray bourque when the colorado avalanche won the cup in 2001 as the seventh and deciding game of the finals would be the last of bourques 22year nhl career having never been on a cupwinning team until that time bourque had until being traded to the avalanche on march 6 2000 only ever played for the boston bruins when sakic received the trophy he did not hoist it but instead immediately handed it to bourque sakic then became the second player on the team to hoist the trophy66 the stanley cup championship team is allotted 100 days during offseason to pass around the cup including the teams parade days with sponsors and a day or so with each player and member of the teams staff it is always accompanied by at least one representative from the hockey hall of fame67 although many players have unofficially spent a day in personal possession of the cup in 1994 the new york rangers started a tradition wherein each member of the cupwinning team is allowed to retain the cup for a day victors of the cup have used it to baptize their children three players the new york islanders clark gillies the anaheim ducks sean odonnell and the pittsburgh penguins nick bonino even allowed their dogs to eat out of the cup6869 original authenticated and replica versionsedit the original stanley cup in the bank vault at the hockey hall of fame in toronto ontario there are technically three versions of the stanley cup the original 1892 bowl or dominion hockey challenge cup the 1963 authenticated presentation cup and the 1993 replica cup at the hall of fame the original 1892 dominion hockey challenge cup purchased and donated by lord stanley was physically awarded to the champions until 197070 and is now displayed in the vault room at the hockey hall of fame in toronto ontario70 the authenticated version or presentation cup was created in 1963 by montreal silversmith carl petersen nhl president clarence campbell felt that the original bowl was becoming too thin and fragile and thus requested a duplicate trophy as a replacement71 the presentation cup is authenticated by the seal of the hockey hall of fame on the bottom which can be seen when winning players lift the cup over their heads and it is the one currently awarded to the champions of the playoffs and used for promotions58 this version was made in secret and its production was only revealed three years later71 the replica trophy called the replica cup was created in 1993 by montreal silversmith louise st jacques to be used as a standin at the hockey hall of fame whenever the presentation cup is not available for display71 there are very few differences between the authenticated version and the replica version the surest way to identify one version from the other is to check the engraving for the 1984 stanley cup winning edmonton oilers the authenticated version has xs engraved over basil pocklingtons name whereas his name is completely missing from the replica version as morale boosteredit the stanley cup has served as a valuable morale booster for both american and canadian troops as well as their nato allies in 2004 the cup was displayed at macdill air force base located near tampa florida the visit gave both american troops and a visiting canadian unit the thrill of seeing the trophy at close hand the event was later touted by officials at macdill as a huge morale booster for our troops72 in 2006 the cup toured marine corps base camp lejeune north carolina where wounded marines were given the opportunity to view and be photographed with the cup in 2007 the stanley cup made its first trip into a combat zone during the trip to kandahar afghanistan from may 2 to may 6 organized by the nhl the hockey hall of fame the nhl alumni and the canadian department of national defence the cup was put on display for canadian and other nato troops it briefly endured a rocket attack on may 3 but emerged unscathed7374 the stanley cup did a second tour in afghanistan as part of a team canada visit in march 20087576 in the spring of 2010 the stanley cup made its fourth trip to afghanistan accompanied by explayers77 on june 27 2010 chicago blackhawks defenceman brent sopel paid tribute to his friend former toronto maple leafs general
