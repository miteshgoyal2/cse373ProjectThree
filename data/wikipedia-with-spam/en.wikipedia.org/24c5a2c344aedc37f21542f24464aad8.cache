engadget praised the services plans including its moneyback feature writing that in the course of six months ive barely touched my monthly 2gb data allotment and frequently receive money back each month from unused data i found myself paying a little more than 20 a month for fi which is the least ive paid for a cell phone service ever lee further liked the services transition between wifi and cellular data writing for the most part i didnt encounter much service disruption when doing so although criticizing the limited number of phones supported the hiccup here of course is that fi is only compatible with a few phones she wrote that id switch in a heartbeat if fi were compatible with my iphone35 jr raphael of computerworld also praised the pricing strategy and network transitions describing it as silently and seamlessly switches as needed to give you the strongest possible connection wherever you are raphael also wrote that fis customer support is actually a pretty good experience elaborating that the app and website are refreshingly simple and easy to use and if you need extra help both interfaces offer the ability to get 247 support from a real person via phone or email however he also criticized the dependency on certain phone models writing that if you dont have and dont want the compatible devices everything else about the service is irrelevant36
