won 11 consecutive games before losing to the green bay packers to finish the season the 13–3 record and 11game winning streak set new team records this was seattles first super bowl appearance in the teams 30year history the seahawks had been mediocre for much of the 1990s recording eight consecutive nonwinning seasons from 1991 through 1998 the team hit a low point in 1996 when thenowner ken behring announced his intention to move the team to the los angeles area the teams fortunes began to turn in 1997 when microsoft cofounder paul allen bought the team and brokered a deal to build a new football stadium qwest field now centurylink field to replace the aging kingdome mike holmgren who had led the green bay packers to super bowls xxxi and xxxii became head coach in 1999 he became the

interceptions and added 124 yards and one touchdown on the ground alexander who had scored at least 16 touchdowns in each of the previous four seasons had the best campaign of his career leading the league with 1880 rushing yards and scoring an nflrecord 28 touchdowns for which he was rewarded with the nfl most valuable player award although the seahawks suffered injuries to starting wide receivers darrell jackson and bobby engram throughout the season the passing game proved potent as engram managed 67 receptions for 778 yards joe jurevicius a backup when the season began started eleven games and caught 55 passes for 694 yards and 10 touchdowns tight end jerramy stevens also emerged as a hasselbeck target catching 45 passes for 554 yards and scoring five touchdowns hasselbeck was protected and alexander was given time to run by a stout offensive line led by pro bowl offensive tackle walter jones guard steve hutchinson and center robbie tobeck and by bruising pro bowl fullback mack strong though unheralded rookie middle linebacker lofa tatupu was the seahawks only defensive pro bowl selection the seahawks defense recorded 50 quarterback sacks leading the nfl in that category defensive end bryce fisher led the seahawks with nine sacks while defensive tackle rocky bernard added 85 and veteran defensive end grant wistrom recorded four despite starting two rookies at linebacker for most of the year the seattle linebacking corps played well led by tatupu who topped the team with 104 tackles and added four sacks three interceptions and one fumble recovery from his strong safety position michael boulware led the team with four interceptions and also tallied two sacks and one fumble recovery the seattle secondary suffered injuries throughout the year notably to free safety ken hamlin secondyear cornerback jordan babineaux played well as he appeared in all sixteen games for seattle intercepting three passes and making 61 tackles for the year the defense surrendered just 271 points 181 fewer than the seahawks offense scored pittsburgh steelersedit main article 2005 pittsburgh steelers season after stumbling to a 7–5 start the steelers rebounded and entered super bowl xl finishing the regular season with an 11–5 record although the team finished tied with the cincinnati bengals for the division lead the bengals won the tiebreaker for the afc north championship based on better divisional record they also became the first team ever to defeat the top three seeded teams on the road in the playoffs 3 cincinnati 1 indianapolis and 2 denver in addition the team became the first sixthseeded team to reach both a conference championship game and the super bowl since the nfl expanded to a 12team playoff format in 1990 under bill cowhers reign as head coach since 1992 the steelers had been one of the top teams in the nfl making the playoffs in 10 out of his 14 seasons advancing to the afc championship game six times and making an appearance in super bowl xxx losing to the dallas cowboys 27–17 after having finished the 2003 season with a 6–10 record and after splitting its first two games to open 2004 pittsburgh lost starting quarterback tommy maddox to injury maddox was replaced by rookie quarterback ben roethlisberger who was drafted with the 11th pick in the 2004 nfl draft but was not expected to play during his rookie season nevertheless roethlisberger led the steelers to victory in all of the teams 14 remaining regular season games giving pittsburgh a 15–1 record and making the steelers the first afc team ever to win 15 games however the steelers lost to eventual super bowl champion new england patriots in the afc championship game pittsburgh began the 2005 season by winning seven of its first nine games but suffered a major setback when both roethlisberger and his backup charlie batch went down with injuries with maddox back as the starter the team was upset by baltimore and dropped two more games after roethlisbergers return falling to thenundefeated indianapolis and division rival cincinnati the postseason hopes of the steelers were in peril but the team recovered to win its final four regular season games and to claim the sixth—and final—seed in the afc playoffs roethlisberger was efficient in his 12 regular season games throwing for 2385 yards and seventeen touchdowns with nine interceptions while adding three rushing touchdowns the steelers main receiving threat was wide receiver hines ward who led the team with 69 receptions for 975 yards and eleven touchdowns his 69 catches gave him a career total of 574 surpassing a franchise record for receptions previously held by hall of famer john stallworth on the other side of the field speedy wide receiver antwaan randle el was a constant breakaway threat catching 35 passes for 558 yards while gaining 448 yards and two touchdowns on punt returns rookie tight end heath miller also recorded 39 receptions for 459 yards and six touchdowns pittsburghs main strength on offense however was its running game running back willie parker was the teams leading rusher with 1202 yards while also recording 18 catches for 218 yards and scoring five touchdowns in shortyardage situations the team relied on 255pound running back jerome bettis who rushed for 368 yards and scored nine touchdowns the 33yearold bettis finished his 13th nfl season as the leagues fifth alltime leading rusher 13662 yards and 91 touchdowns but until this point he had never played in a super bowl the steelers rushing attack was powered by an offensive line led by pro bowl guard alan faneca and pro bowl reserve center jeff hartings the steelers defense ranked fourth in the nfl giving up 2840 total yards per game the pittsburgh defense was led by its linebacking corps joey porter james farrior clark haggans and larry foote porter led all nfl linebackers with 105 quarterback sacks and also recorded two interceptions and a fumble recovery haggans tallied nine sacks and 40 tackles while farrior added a teamhigh 119 tackles to go with his two sacks and one fumble recovery in the secondary free safety chris hope led the team with three interceptions while pro bowl safety troy polamalu the teams top threat in the defensive backfield notched 91 tackles three sacks two fumble recoveries and two interceptions the steelers became just the third team to win the super bowl despite not playing a single home game in the playoffs the green bay packers who won super bowl i against the kansas city chiefs and the kansas city chiefs who won super bowl iv against the minnesota vikings also accomplished the feat the steelers however had to win four games to accomplish the feat while the chiefs won three and packers won only two games of a

bowl having been the cowboys opponent in super bowl xiii pittsburgh also became the first team to have worn white jerseys for a home super bowl and colored jerseys for an away one the teams took the field while flanked on either side by flags bearing the names of all previous super bowl mvps although the participating teams each entered as a team for their introduction the steelers insisted on

ii take the vince lombardi trophy to the podium whence it was presented to steelers owner dan rooney game summaryedit first quarteredit after the first four possessions of the game ended with punts seahawks punt returner peter warrick gave his team good field position by returning chris gardockis 37yard punt 12 yards to seattles 49yard line quarterback matt hasselbeck then started off the drive with a pair of completions to receivers darrell jackson and joe jurevicius for gains of 20 and 11 yards respectively on the third play of the drive jackson caught a pass in the endzone apparently for a touchdown but the play was nullified as jackson was called for pass interference running back shaun alexander ran the ball the next two plays but gained only three yards hasselbecks thirddown pass attempt fell incomplete and the seahawks were forced to settle for a 47yard field goal by kicker josh brown which was successful by the end of the first quarter the steelers had failed to gain a first down and quarterback ben roethlisberger had completed one of five pass attempts for one yard second quarteredit on their first secondquarter possession pittsburgh once more was forced to punt after three plays but benefited from another seahawks penalty a holding call that nullified warricks 34yard punt return the steelers forced a seattle punt but seattle safety michael boulware intercepted a roethlisberger pass at the seattle 17yard line on the ensuing drive the seahawks though were once more forced to punt after three plays and pittsburgh drove into seattle territory on the following drive an offensive pass interference call against tight end heath miller and a sack for an eightyard loss by seahawks defensive end grant wistrom though backed the steelers to the 40yard line and left the team facing a thirddownand28 however roethlisberger hit receiver hines ward out of a scramble and extremely unorthodox against the grain pass for a 37yard gain to keep the drive going jerome bettis carried the ball on the next two plays taking his team to the oneyard line but not into the endzone on the thirddown play after the twominute warning roethlisberger faked a handoff and dove into the endzone himself there was some confusion as to whether or not he had scored since the referee hesitated for a bit after the play ended but he eventually signaled a touchdown and it was upheld after a replay challenge on the strength of a 19yard jurevicius reception seattle advanced the ball to the pittsburgh 36yard line but after the drive stalled brown missed a 54yard field goal attempt to the right and the steelers ran out the clock to end the first half third quarteredit the steelers took the ball to begin the second half and just two plays in running back willie parker broke through for a 75yard touchdown run giving his team a 14–3 lead and setting a record for the longest run in super bowl history beating marcus allens super bowl xviii mark by one yard the seahawks drove into pittsburgh territory on the next drive sparked by a 21yard run by alexander but brown again missed a fieldgoal attempt this one from 50 yards as seattle was unable to close the 11point deficit pittsburgh drove 54 yards to the seattle sixyard line to put themselves in position to take a large lead but seahawks defensive back kelly herndon intercepted a pass from roethlisberger and returned it a super bowl record 76 yards to the steelers 20yard line from there the seahawks required just two plays to score on hasselbecks 16yard touchdown pass to tight end jerramy stevens cutting their deficit to 14–10 the teams exchanged punts two from pittsburgh one from seattle to fill out most of the third quarter but the seahawks ended the quarter having driven from their own twoyard line to near midfield fourth quarteredit the drive continued in the fourth quarter as the seahawks reached the pittsburgh 19yard line an 18yard pass to stevens though was negated on a penalty call against seattle tackle sean locklear for holding denying the seahawks an opportunity for a firstdownandgoal from the 1yardline three plays later pittsburgh defensive back ike taylor intercepted a hasselbeck pass at the 5yard line and returned it 24 yards while tackling taylor hasselbeck dove low and was flagged for blocking below the waist the penalty added 15 yards to the return and gave the steelers the ball on their own 44yard line four plays later pittsburgh ran a wide receiver reverse but the play turned out to be a pass play by wide receiver antwaan randle el who played quarterback while in college parker took a pitch from roethlisberger and handed off to randle el who was running in the opposite direction randle el then pulled up and threw a 43yard touchdown pass to a wideopen ward giving the steelers a 21–10 lead and also marking the first time a wide receiver threw a touchdown pass in a super bowl on the ensuing possession hasselbeck ran the ball for eighteen yards and was briefly touched by steelers linebacker larry foote as the former fell to the ground though the play was initially ruled a fumble with the ball recovered by the steelers a seahawks challenge proved successful as officials ruled hasselbeck to have been down prior to his having lost the ball seattle aided by a 13yard jurevicius reception drove to the pittsburgh 48yard line but could go no further a tom rouen punt entered the end zone giving the steelers possession on their own 20yard line pittsburgh possessed the ball on for nearly fourandonehalf minutes on the ensuing drive as bettis carried seven times seattle was forced to use all of its three timeouts to stop the clock but nevertheless had only 151 left when it took the ball from its own 20yard line following a gardocki punt a 35yard reception by jurevicius took the seahawks into pittsburgh territory and a 13yard bobby engram reception took the team to within fieldgoal range but dubious clockmanagement and playcalling left the team with just 35 seconds remaining an incompletion and a threeyard pass to stevens over the middle of the field consumed 26 seconds and hasselbeck threw incomplete near stevens on fourth down giving the steelers the ball on downs with just three seconds remaining after which a roethlisberger kneeldown ended the game box scoreedit 1 2 3 4 total seahawks 3 0 7 0 10 steelers 0 7 7 7 21 at ford field

to officiatingedit the officiating in super bowl xl was met with criticism from members of the media soon after the game one call that was complained about was an offensive pass interference on wide receiver darrell jackson for a pushoff against steelers safety chris hope that nullified his 16yard touchdown reception in the first quarter22 however according to the nfls director of officiating at the time mike pereira the call was indeed correct as jackson had blatantly pushed off23 another complaint had to do with a penalty in the fourth quarter against seattle right tackle sean locklear for holding steelers linebacker clark haggans that nullified a deep pass pereira later stated that locklear was definitively holding and the call was correct624 also disputed was the penalty on hasselbeck for an illegal block while making a tackle during ike taylors interception return25 in addition many steeler fans were outraged by an incomplete pass call early in the game from hasselbeck to jeremy stevens stevens appeared to have possession and then fumble only for the officials to rule he never had complete possession26 the steelers also were upset about a call on play that appeared to give them possession of the football when matt hasselbeck fumbled while scrambling it was ruled however that hasselbeck had been touched before losing control of the football thus negating the fumble24 kansas city star writer jason whitlock encapsulated some views when he wrote the day after the game bill leavy and his crew ruined super bowl xl am i the only one who would like to hear them defend their incompetence27 initially some fans reacted negatively as well a february 7 online espn poll found that with 103167 votes cast 617 of those votes were cast for the choice of officiating mistakes affected the outcome of super bowl xl28 seahawks head coach mike holmgren himself took issue with the officiating at a rally for his team on february 6 at qwest field saying we knew it was going to be tough going against the pittsburgh steelers i didnt know we were going to have to play the guys in the striped shirts as well29 in response to the criticisms leveled at the officials the nfl just two days after the game released a statement defending the officials performance the game was properly officiated including as in most nfl games some tight plays that produced disagreement about the calls made by the officials nfl spokesman greg aiello said in a statement30 highprofile referee ed hochuli said the super bowl was one of those games where it seemed the big calls went against seattle and that was just fortuitous bad fortuitous for seattle hochuli went on to say that the league felt actually that the super bowl was well officiated now that doesnt mean there were no mistakes there are always mistakes but it was a wellofficiated game31 on august 6 2010 while visiting the seahawks preseason training camp for an annual rules interpretation session with the seattle media leavy brought up super bowl xl without being asked and said31 it was a tough thing for me i kicked two calls in the fourth quarter and i impacted the game and as an official you never want to do that it left me with a lot of sleepless nights and i think about it constantly ill go to my grave wishing that id been better i know that i did my best at that time but it wasnt good enough when we make mistakes you got to step up and own them its something that all officials have to deal with but unfortunately when you have to deal with it in the super bowl its difficult32 the super bowl xl officiating controversy was later listed as 8 on the nfls list of the top ten controversial calls of all time6 commercialsedit as usual the american television broadcast of the super bowl showcased top
