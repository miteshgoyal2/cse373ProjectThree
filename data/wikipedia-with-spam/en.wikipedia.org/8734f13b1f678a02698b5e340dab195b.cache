family home for centuries21 the ground was consecrated by the bishop of peterborough prior to the burial22 at the ceremony the royal standard which had covered the coffin was removed by dianas brother moments before she was buried and replaced with the spencer family flag the earl claimed that she diana is a spencer now princes charles william and harry agreed to the change however paul burrell dianas former butler condemned the move saying it had more to do with his spencer v windsor war than doing what diana would have wanted it was inappropriate and disrespectful i knew it was not what diana would have wanted with that act her brother was depriving the princess of her proper status in life – a status of which she was proud23 the original plan was for diana to be buried in the spencer family vault at the local church in nearby great brington but lord spencer said that he was concerned about public safety and security and the onslaught of visitors that might overwhelm great brington he decided that diana would be buried where her grave could be easily cared for and visited in privacy by william harry and other spencer relatives24 the island is in an ornamental lake known as the round oval within althorp parks gardens25 a path with thirtysix oak trees marking each year of her life leads to the oval four black swans swim in the lake in the water there are water lilies which in addition to white roses were dianas favourite flowers on the southern verge of the round oval sits the summerhouse previously in the gardens of admiralty house london and now adapted to serve as a memorial to diana26 an ancient arboretum stands nearby which contains trees planted by the family24 the spencer familys decision to bury the princess in this secluded—and private—location has enabled them to visit her grave in private27 the burial party was provided by the 2nd battalion the princess of waless royal regiment who were given the honour of carrying the princess across to the
