ie before 1926 please look up the copyright rules for the specific country at 1 it was first published in the usa before 1989 and its copyright expired because it was published without a copyright notice andor without the necessary copyright registrationplease look up the exact rules at 2 its copyright expired for some other reason please explain below explanation please provide any evidence necessary to verify the public domain status this file is in the public domain for some other reason i can demonstrate that this work is legally in the public domain ie nobody owns any copyrights on it this may be for a variety of reasons for instance because it was created by the us federal government or because it is too simple to attract any copyright public domain means that nobody owns any copyrights on this work it does not mean simply that it is freely viewable somewhere on the web or that it has been widely used by others this is not for images you simply found somewhere on the web most images on the web are under copyright and belong to somebody even if you believe the owner wont care about that copyright if it is in the public domain you must be able to point to an actual law
