him causing a michael jackson poster on the door to fall off and its glass frame to smash the boy retaliates by setting up large speaker cabinets with levels of loud louder and are you nuts respectively with the dial turned up all the way to are you nuts behind his fathers reclining chair donning leather gloves and sunglasses strapping on a wolfgang guitar and playing a power chord and telling the father to eat this21 the sound then shatters and destroys the house windows and sends his father seated in the chair halfway around the world where the actual song begins21 the kids mother tess harper comments that his father will be very upset when he gets back the album version of the song does not feature culkins nor wendts voice they are replaced by voice actors performing a similar intro the boys father crashes in africa and jackson sings black or white surrounded by various cultures scenebyscene23 the video shows scenes in which african hunters begin dancing by using moves from

version video greatest hits – history long version without graffiti on vhs version but with graffiti on dvd version number ones short version and michael jacksons vision long version without graffiti controversy and censorshipedit a comparison between the two versions of michael jacksons black or white music video the original version and the computeraltered racist graffiti version with the messages reading hitler lives with swastika nigger go home no more wetbacks and kkk rules coincidentally the nigger go home message has the gs made to look like the number 6 to make the content a little less offending to viewers hence referencing the illuminati and the 666 controversy was generated concerning the last four minutes of the original music video jackson walks out of the studio as a black panther and then morphs into himself23 then he walks outside to perform some of his most physically complicated dance techniques in a similar way to billie jean the scene is also very similar to that of a commercial jackson appeared in for la gear in 1989 this part contained sexually suggestive scenes when jackson starts to grab his crotch21 and then zips his pants up in the original version jackson is seen smashing windows21 destroying a car and causing an inn called the royal arms to explode jackson later apologized saying that the violent and suggestive behavior was an interpretation of the animal instinct of a black panther and mtv and other music video networks removed the last four minutes from subsequent broadcasts23 to make the vandalism and violence more understandable to viewers an altered version was produced with racial messages added via cgi graffiti to the windows jackson breaks the version included in the box set michael jacksons vision is the

black or white has been covered by some artists since its release in 1991 weird al yankovic recorded a parody of black or white titled snack all night which was never released although jackson was a longtime supporter of yankovics work and had approved past parodies he told yankovic that he was reluctant to approve a parody of black or white because of the message of the song26 yankovic believes that jacksons rejection of the parody was ultimately for the best because he was unsatisfied with the quality of the song and its scrapping left room on his next album for smells like nirvana one of his biggest hits26 as with other rejected parodies yankovic has performed snack all night during his concerts27 in 2009 singer adam lambert performed the song on the 8th season of american idol during the michael jackson episode28 which was reaired on june 29 in a tribute to the death of jackson on june 25 in the early 1990s the childrens show sesame street also spoofed the song with a song called

surrounded by fish wet and dry are further demonstrated with several kids mr handford and maria getting buckets of water dumped on them both the song and video spoof black or white in 2013 as the new rules in the cop for rhythmic gymnastics allowed music with words the georgian gymnast salome phajava used a shortened version for her ribbon routine in 2013 the song was featured on a heavy metal tribute album as a tribute to jacksons memory and legacy the cover song featured lajon witherspoon of sevendust on vocals and bruce kulick formerly of kiss on guitar the music video particularly the panther segment have been referenced or parodied by television shows and artists the video including the panther segment was parodied by the sketch comedy tv show in living color in which tommy davidson appeared as jackson but instead of a panther davidson morphs from a tiny black kitten at the end of the video jackson is arrested and as he is being led off by the police he muses i guess i really am black29 the panther segment was also parodied by the popular american sketch comedy television series madtv in 1991 english rock band genesis parodied the black or white video in the ending of their video for i cant dance in which member phil collins imitates michael jacksons panther fit in front of a stark white background30 the face morphing portion of the video was satirized in a
