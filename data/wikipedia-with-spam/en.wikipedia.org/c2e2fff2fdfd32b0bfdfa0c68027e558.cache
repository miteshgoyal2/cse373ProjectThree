as the active partner and head of team operations he named the supersonics after boeings recently awarded contract for the sst project which was later canceled10 the supersonics were seattles first major league sports franchise beginning play in october 1967 the supersonics were coached by al bianchi and featured allstar guard walt hazzard and nba allrookie team members bob rule and al tucker the expansion team stumbled out of the gates with a 144–116 loss in their first game and finished the season with a 23–59 record11 1968–1975 the lenny wilkens eraedit lenny wilkens with the supersonics hazzard was traded to the atlanta hawks before the start of the next season for lenny wilkens wilkens brought a strong allaround game to the supersonics averaging 224 points 82 assists and 62 rebounds per game for seattle in the 1968–69 season rule meanwhile improved on his rookie statistics with 240 points per game and 115 rebounds per game the supersonics however only won 30 games and bianchi was replaced by wilkens as playercoach during the offseason wilkens and rule both represented seattle in the 1970 nba allstar game and wilkens led the nba in assists during the 1969–70 season in june 1970 the nba owners voted 13–4 to work toward a merger with the aba12 supersonics owner sam schulman a member of the aba–nba merger committee in 1970 was so ardently eager to merge the leagues that he publicly announced that if the nba did not accept the merger agreement worked out with the aba he would move the supersonics from the nba to the aba schulman also threatened to move his soontobe aba team to los angeles to compete directly with the lakers13 the oscar robertson suit delayed the merger and the supersonics remained in seattle early in the 1970–71 season however rule tore his achilles tendon and was lost for the rest of the year arrival of spencer haywoodedit wilkens was named the 1971 allstar game mvp but the big news of the season came when owner sam schulman managed to land american basketball association rookie of the year and mvp spencer haywood following a lengthy court battle see haywood v national basketball assn the following season the supersonics went on to record their first winning season at 47–35 the team led by playercoach wilkens and first team forward haywood held a 46–27 mark on march 3 but late season injuries to starters haywood dick snyder and don smith contributed to the team losing eight of its final nine games otherwise the 1971–72 team might very well have become the franchises first playoff team for the 1972–73 season wilkens was dealt to cleveland in a highly unpopular trade14 and without his leadership the supersonics fell to a 26–56 record one of the few bright spots of the season was haywoods second consecutive allnba first team selection as he averaged a supersonics record 292 points per game and collected 129 rebounds per game 1975–1983 the championship yearsedit jack sikma in 1978 the legendary bill russell was hired as the head coach in the following year and in 1975 he coached the supersonics to the playoffs for the first time the team which starred haywood guards fred brown and slick watts and rookie center tommy burleson defeated the detroit pistons in a threegame miniseries before falling to the eventual champion golden state warriors in six games the next season the supersonics traded haywood to new york forcing the remaining players to pick up the offensive slack guard fred brown now in his fifth season was selected to the 1976 nba allstar game and finished fifth in the league in scoring average and free throw percentage burlesons game continued to strengthen while watts led the nba in both assists and steals and was named to the allnba defensive first team the supersonics again made the playoffs but lost to the phoenix suns in six games in spite of strong performances from both brown 285 ppg and burleson 208 ppg during the series russell left the supersonics after the 1976–77 season and under new coach bob hopkins the team started the season dismally at 5–17 lenny wilkens was brought back to replace hopkins and the teams fortunes immediately turned around the supersonics won 11 of their first 12 games under wilkens finished the season at 47–35 won the western conference title and led the washington bullets three games to two before losing in seven games in the 1978 nba finals other than the loss of center marvin webster to new york the supersonics roster stayed largely intact during the offseason and in the 1978–79 season they went on to win their first division title in the playoffs the supersonics defeated the phoenix suns in a tough seven game conference final series to set up a rematch with the washington bullets in the finals this time the bullets lost to the supersonics in five games to give seattle its first and only nba title the championship team roster included the powerful backcourt tandem of gus williams and finals mvp dennis johnson second year allstar center jack sikma forwards john johnson and lonnie shelton and key reserves fred brown and paul silas the 1979–80 season saw the supersonics finish second in the pacific division to the los angeles lakers with a strong 56–26 record fred brown won the nbas first threepoint shooting percentage title jack sikma played in the second of his seven career allstar games for seattle gus williams and dennis johnson were both named to the allnba second team and johnson was also named to the allnba first defensive team for the second consecutive year the supersonics made it to the western conference finals for the third straight season but lost to the lakers in five games it was the last time that the backcourt of williams and johnson would play together in supersonics uniforms as johnson was traded to the phoenix suns before the start of the 1980–81 season and williams sat out the year due to a contract dispute as a result the supersonics fell to last place in the pacific division with a 34–48 mark so far the only time they have ever finished in last place williams returned for the 1981–82 season and seattle managed respectable 52–30 and 48–34 records during the next two years in 1981 the sonics also created the sonics superchannel the first sports subscription cable service15 1983–1989 a period of declineedit over most of the franchises history seattle played its home games at key arena in october 1983 original team owner sam schulman sold the supersonics to barry ackerley initiating a period of decline and mediocrity for the franchise 1984 saw fred brown retire after playing 13 productive seasons all with seattle his career reflected much of the supersonics history to that time having been on the same team roster as rule and wilkens during his rookie season playing a key role on seattles first playoff teams and being the teams important sixth man during the championship series years in recognition of his many contributions to the team browns number was retired in 1986 lenny wilkens left the organization following the 1984–85 season and when jack sikma was traded after the 1985–86 season the last remaining tie to the supersonics championship team aside from trainer frank furtado had been severed among the few supersonics highlights of second half of the 1980s were tom chambers allstar game mvp award in 1987 seattles surprise appearance in the 1987 western conference finals and the performance of the power trio of chambers xavier mcdaniel and dale ellis in 1987–88 the three players each averaged over 20 points per game with ellis at 258 ppg mcdaniel at 214 and chambers at 204 in the 1988–89 season with chambers having signed with phoenix ellis improved his scoring average to 275 points per game and finished second in the league in threepoint percentage the supersonics finished with a 47–35 record and made it to the second round of the 1989 playoffs 1989–1998 the paytonkemp eraedit george karl served as seattles head coach for six seasons 1992–1998 the supersonics began setting a new foundation with the drafting of forward shawn kemp in 1989 and guard gary payton in 1990 and the trading of dale ellis and xavier mcdaniel to other teams during the 1990–91 season it was george karls arrival as head coach in 1992 however that marked a return to regular season and playoff competitiveness for the supersonics with the continued improvement of gary payton and shawn kemp the supersonics posted a 55–27 record in the 1992–93 season and took the phoenix suns to seven games in the western conference finals the next year 1993–94 the supersonics had the best record in the nba at 63–19 but suffered a first round loss to the denver nuggets becoming the first 1 seed to lose a playoff series to an 8th seed the sonics moved to the tacoma dome for the 1994–95 season while the coliseum underwent renovations and went on to earn a second place 5725 record again the sonics were eliminated in the first round this time to the los angeles lakers in four games the team returned to the rebuilt coliseum renamed keyarena for the 1995–96 season perhaps the strongest roster the supersonics ever had was the 1995–96 team which had a franchise best 64–18 record with a deep roster of allnba second team selections kemp and payton forward detlef schrempf forward sam perkins guard hersey hawkins and guard nate mcmillan the team reached the nba finals but lost to the michael jordanled chicago bulls in six games seattle continued to be a western conference powerhouse during the next two seasons winning 57 games in 1996–97 and 61 games in 1997–98 for their second and third straight pacific division titles at the end of the 1997–98 season longtime sonic and defensive specialist nate mcmillan retired and disagreements with management led karl to end his tenure as head coach despite him winning the 199798 coach of the year he was replaced by former sonic paul westphal for the 1998–99 season 1998–2008 a decade of strugglesedit vin baker was an nba allstar with the supersonics during the 1997–98 season the 1998–99 season saw the supersonics again descend into an extended period of mediocrity westphal was fired during the 2000–01 season and replaced by thenassistant coach nate mcmillan on an interim basis eventually losing the interim label the next year the 2002–03 season saw allstar gary payton traded to the milwaukee bucks and it also marked the end to the supersonics 11year streak of having a season with a winning percentage of at least 500 the second longest current streak in the nba at the time the 2004–05 team surprised many when it won the organizations sixth division title under the leadership of ray allen and rashard lewis winning 52 games and defeating the sacramento kings in the first round of the 2005 nba playoffs and advancing to the 2005 western conference semifinals where the sonics would proceed to lose in 6 games to the established trio of tony parker tim duncan and manu ginóbili and the san antonio spurs who would later go on to defeat the detroit pistons in the 2005 nba finals this appearance also marked the last time that this incarnation of the supersonics would make the playoffs during the offseason in 2005 head coach nate mcmillan left the sonics to accept a highpaying position to coach the portland trail blazers after his departure the team regressed the following season with a 35–47 record 2007–08 arrival of kevin durantedit on may 22 2007 the supersonics were awarded the 2nd pick in the 2007 nba draft equaling the highest draft position the team has ever held they selected kevin durant from the university of texas on june 28 2007 the supersonics traded ray allen and the 35th pick of the 2nd round glen davis in the 2007 nba draft to the boston celtics for rights to the 5th pick jeff green wally szczerbiak and delonte west on july 11 2007 the supersonics and the orlando magic agreed to a sign and trade for rashard lewis the supersonics received a future secondround draft pick and a 95 million trade exception from the magic on july 20 the supersonics used the trade exception and a secondround draft pick to acquire kurt thomas and two firstround draft picks from the phoenix sunscitation needed in 2008 morale was low at the beginning of the supersonics season as talks with the city of seattle for a new arena had broken down the sonics had gotten a franchise player with second overall pick in the nba draft with durant however with the allen trade the sonics did not have much talent to surround their rookie forward as they lost their first eight games under coach p j carlesimo on the way to a 314 record in the first month of the season durant would live up to expectations as he led all rookies in scoring at 203 ppg and won the rookie of the year however the seattle supersonics posted a franchise worst record of 2062 it would end up being the final season in seattle as bennett ended up getting the rights to move the team after settling all the legal issues with the city16 relocation to oklahoma cityedit main article seattle supersonics relocation to oklahoma city further information oklahoma city thunder from

ownership group wont own that seattle team for a long long time in seattle or somewhere else its presumptuous to assume theyre going to move that franchise to oklahoma city cornett said i understand

moved to new orleans and began play as the new orleans hornets for the 2002–03 nba season in months prior to the settlement seattle publicly released email conversations that took place within bennetts ownership group and alleged that they indicated at least some members of the group had a desire to move the team to oklahoma city prior to the purchase in 2006 before that sonics coowner aubrey mcclendon told the journal record an oklahoma city newspaper that we didnt buy the team to keep it in seattle we hoped to come here although bennett denied knowledge of this24 seattle used these incidents to argue that the ownership failed to negotiate in good faith prompting schultz to file a lawsuit seeking to rescind the sale of the team and transfer the ownership to a courtappointed receiver25 the nba claimed schultz lawsuit was void because schultz signed a release forbidding himself to sue bennetts group but also argued that the proposal would have violated league ownership

mcginn about the possibilities of investing in an arena in hopes of securing an nba franchise and reviving the supersonics28 an offer was made by mcginn to hansen to obtain ownership of keyarena for little to no money to aid in his efforts29 as keyarena was deemed unacceptable by the nba and barely breaking even in operation the facility would likely have needed to be leveled and a new one built on the site determining there were transportation concerns in the lower queen anne neighborhood around the seattle center hansen declined in favor of building a new arena at another locationcitation needed hansen began quietly purchasing available land near safeco field in seattles sodo industrial neighborhood at the southern end of what was designated a stadium transition overlay district housing both safeco field home of the mlbs seattle mariners and centurylink field home of the nfls seattle seahawks and mlss seattle sounders a short time later hansen presented to mcginn and king county executive dow constantine the proposal for a basketball hockey and entertainment arena at the sodo site mcginn employed a stadium consultant on the citys behalf to study the viability of such a project local media took notice of the land purchases and began to postulate that it was for an arena rumors of meetings between mcginn and hansens investment group began to circulate in late 2011 and were finally acknowledged in early 2012citation needed at that time rumors that hansen would begin pursuing a vulnerable franchise to relocate to seattle began making the rounds most of the discussion centered on the sacramento kings a struggling franchise that had been trying to put together a plan to replace the aging sleep train arena then called the power balance pavilion for years with no luck while hansen had not spoken in public about his desires or pursuits for a specific team the rumors were rampant enough that think big sacramento a community action group created by sacramento mayor kevin johnson to develop solutions for the kings composed an open letter to hansen asking him not to pursue the citys team30 meanwhile negotiations between mcginn constantine and hansen continued on development of a memorandum of understanding that would lay out the relationship for a publicprivate partnership on the new arenacitation needed on may 16 2012 after coming to agreement mcginn constantine and hansen presented the proposed memorandum of understanding to the public31 mcginn and constantine had insisted on a number of protections for the citizens of seattle and king county specifically that no public financing on the project would be committed until hansen and his investors had secured an nba team to be primary tenant the mou proposal included a financial model that made the project selffinanced in which no new taxes would be levied to provide funds and city bonds issued would be paid back by taxes and revenue generated solely by the new arena the proposal was turned over to the seattle city council and the king county council for review and approvalcitation needed the king county council voted to approve the mou on july 30 2012 adding amendments that provided for work with the port of seattle securing the supersonics naming rights offering reduced price tickets support for the seattle storm wnba franchise and require an economic analysis32 the approval was also on the condition that any changes made by the seattle city council which still had yet to vote on the proposal would need to be voted on and approved separately the seattle council had announced that morning that amendments of their own were intended and negotiations begancitation needed hansen and the seattle city council announced on september 11 2012 a tentative agreement on a revised mou that included the county councils amendments and new provisions specifically a personal guarantee from hansen to cover not only cost overruns of construction of the new arena but to make up any backfall for annual repayment of the city bonds issued33 to address concerns of the port of seattle the seattle mariners and local industry a sodo transportation improvement fund to be maintained at 40 million by tax revenue generated by the arena was also included also all parties agreed that transaction documents would not be signed and construction would not begin before the state required environmental impact analysis was completed by a vote of 7–2 the seattle city council approved the amended mou on september 24 201234 the king county council reviewed the amended mou and voted unanimously in favor of approval on october 15 201235 the final mou was signed and fully executed by mayor mcginn and executive constantine on october 18 2012 starting an effective period of

seattle as early as the 2013–14 nba season363738 on january 20 2013 several sources reported that the maloof family had reached a binding purchase and sale agreement to sell hansen and ballmers ownership group their 53 majority stake in the kings franchise pending approval of the nbas board of governors39 the next day the nba hansen and the maloofs all released statements announcing the agreement which also included the 12 minority stake of owner robert hernreich and based the sale price on a team valuation of 525 million404142 sacramento mayor johnson offered a quick rebuttal to the announcement stating that the agreement was not a done deal and that sacramento would have the opportunity to present a counteroffer to the nbacitation needed david stern then nba commissioner confirmed on february 6 2013 that the maloofs had filed paperwork with the league office to officially request relocation of the kings from sacramento to seattle on behalf of the potential new ownership group43 johnson with guidance from stern and the nba league office began to assemble an alternative ownership group that would keep the kings in sacramento and aid in getting a new arena constructed on february 26 2013 the sacramento city council voted to enter into negotiations with an unnamed group of investors revealed two days later to be headed by grocery magnate and developer ron burkle and mark mastrov founder of 24 hour fitness an initial counteroffer presented to the nba by this new group was deemed not comparable as to merit consideration44 burkle eventually left the group because of a conflict with other business interests but offered to be primary developer of lands around the planned downtown location of the new arena to aid in city council passage of public funding for the project45 mastrov took a backseat to vivek ranadivé founder and ceo of tibco and a minority owner of the golden state warriors brought in to assemble a stronger group of investors46 others including paul jacobs ceo of qualcomm sacramento developer mark friedman former facebook executive chris kelly and manufacturer raj bhathal were added to the group to address team ownership and arena investmentcitation needed ahead of the annual board of governors meeting where they were expected to vote on approval of the sale of the kings to hansen and ballmers group as well as the relocation request members of the nba owners finance and relocation committees held a meeting in new york city on april 3 2013 for the seattle group and the sacramento group to each present their proposals47 any vote would only be on the psa presented by hansen and ballmer and the sacramento proposal was considered a backup offer coming out of that meeting the nba removed the vote from the agenda of the bog meeting and postponed it for two weeks while information was reviewed despite stated desires to the contrary a bidding war began between hansens and ranadivés groups including hansen raising the team valuation of their offer twice from 525 million to 550 million to 625 million and ranadivé offering to forgo the team revenue sharing that has frequently kept smaller market teams like the kings financially stablecitation needed with the meeting of the board of governors to vote moved again to midmay the groups were asked to make another brief presentation to the full relocation committee on april 29 2013 the committee voted to recommend rejection of the relocation request to the full board48 when the board of governors finally convened in dallas on may 15 2013 they heard final presentations from both the seattle and sacramento groups the bog voted 228 against moving the kings from sacramento to seattle49 as the psa for the sale of the team was for all intents and purposes dependent upon relocation the nba rejected the sale without votecitation needed though initially resistant to the idea after negotiations on may 17 2013 the maloof family and hernreich formally agreed to sell their ownership stake in the kings 65 of the team valued at us535 million to ranadivés ownership group50 part of the 348 million purchase was considered paid with a

replace the aging bmo harris bradley center because of its small size and lack of amenities51 the team had recently signed a lease through the 2016–17 nba season but the nba made it clear that the lease would not be renewed past that point with counties surrounding milwaukee passing ordinances that they would not approve a regional tax option to fund a new arena rumors began swirling that owner herb kohl would need to sell all or part of his ownership of the team though kohl had repeatedly stated he would not sell to someone intent on moving the bucks out of wisconsin manywho had pegged the team as a likely potential candidate to move to seattle on april 16 2014 it was announced that kohl had agreed to sell the franchise to new york hedgefund investors marc lasry and wesley edens for a record 550 million the deal included provisions for contributions of 100 million each from kohl and the new ownership group for a total of 200 million towards the construction of a new downtown
