which existed from 1956 through 19684 the territorial party was established in 1956 by discontented former popular party members5 including frank d perez6 pedro leon guerrero7 edward t calvo6 cynthia torres8 b j bordallo6 vicente reyes7 felix carbullido7 and antonio duenas7 the territorial party had only one successful election in 1964 when it won a majority in the guam legislature with 13 thirteen of the 21 twentyone seats this changed during the 1966 election when the territorials lost all twentyone seats to the democrats the territorials demise came after they blocked a popular urban renewal plan which was supported by the democrats as the territorials backed private investment the territorial party dissolved soon after4 on november 21 1966 a few weeks after the general election of that year former governor joseph flores along with former territorial senators carlos garcia camacho kurt s moylan and vicente c reyes officially formed the republican party of guam47 other territorials soon became active including senators g ricardo salas and frank d perez the new republicans were careful not to portray their new party as a criticism of the territorial party whose members they hoped to attract republican governors of guamedit at the young age of fortyfour carlos camacho succeeded governor manuel fl guerrero as governor of guam with kurt moylan appointed as lieutenant governor camachos term as appointed governor lasted only eighteen months due to the elective governor act that was signed into law by the us congress in 1968 allowing for guams citizens to choose their governor the act took effect in 1970 when guams first election was held camachos term was best remembered for his christmas 1969 visit to the troops from guam who were fighting in vietnam camacho–moylan administrationedit camacho first selected senator g ricardo salas as his running mate but later announced that kurt moylan would be the republicans candidate for lieutenant governor the democratic primary was close race between former governor manuel f l guerrero senator ricardo bordallo and attorney and former speaker joaquin c arriola after a close primary and a contentious runoff election guerrero defeated bordallo and in the general election camacho–moylan defeated bordallo–taitano camacho and moylans historic inauguration was held on january 4 1971 at the plaza de españa in agana he uses the resources of the government to enhance economic opportunities by granting incentives through the guam economics development and offering various forms of assistance to the private sector during his entire five and a half years in office camacho presided over one of the largest eras of hotel construction activities on guam with construction finishing or starting on the kakue hotel reef hotel hilton hotel okura hotel fujita tumon beach continental travelodge and guam dai ichi hotelcitation needed camacho also initiated massive road projects that were continued by his successors including the widening of marine drive now marine corps drive from hospital road north to route 16 in harmon and the reconstruction of other major highways in the villages of agat dededo and tamuning among others he is also credited with enticing many educated chamorros back to guam to reverse what was seen as a brain drain at the time including tony palomo greg sanchez mary sanchez tony unpingco dr pedro sanchez dr katherine aguon juan c tenorio bert unpingco ben perez eddie duenas joseph f ada and frank blas many of them took jobs with the government of guam as administrators and later became senators camacho also kept on other able administrators even if they were not of his party affiliation which served to stabilize the government as a team camacho and moylan worked to develop economic opportunity by creating incentives to attract business and encourage local participation in business at the time guam elected its first governor the federal government still had control over much of the islands utilities and roads they struggled to work toward gaining more selfgovernment and selfdetermination in the 1974 gubernatorial election camacho withstood a primary challenge by paul mcdonald calvo but was defeated for reelection in a rematch with senator ricardo bordallo who won the election9 an election challenge by the bordallo–sablan campaign went all the way to the us supreme courtclarification needed following his unsuccessful bid for reelection as governor camacho resumed his career as a dentist calvoada administrationedit calvo ran for governor again in 1978 this time with popular senator joseph f ada calvos image of a successful business executive resonated well with the voters as he ran on a balancethebudget campaign and attacked the bordallo administration for the huge jump in the budget deficit and high crime rate calvo built a strong political organization complete with regional and village groups and had the financial backing not only of calvos enterprises but of supporters in the business community bordallo meanwhile was hurt as his running mate sablan ran against him in the primary and calvoada won the election with 52 percent of the votes during his first year as governor calvo reduced the government of guams deficit by 27 million but the deficit continued to climb for the rest of his term due mainly to longstanding problems with tax collections guams economy began to regain health under calvos administration as he sought to attract new businesses to guam including a tunafishing fleet a garment manufacturer and hotel construction visitor arrivals also registered sharp increases but calvos term as governor was marred by the teachers strike of 1981 which lasted many months and caused deep divisions in guams education system he lost to bordallo in the 1982 election adablas administrationedit first termedit his running mate and lieutenant governor was former senator frank blas ada served numerous terms in the guam legislature becoming the first republican speaker of the legislature when the republicans captured control of the body from the democratic party ada was elected lt governor of guam with running mate paul mcdonald calvo in 1978 but declined the opportunity to serve as calvos running mate for reelection in 1982 and instead returned to the legislature calvo lost the subsequent election to ricky bordallo ada is the only guam political leader to serve as speaker lieutenant governor and governor he stewarded guams economic expansion and pushed successfully for return of land held by the us military when ada began his first term guam was in the throes of an economic recession with the government suffering under a crushing deficit ada put all his administrations efforts toward guams economic recovery and eventually he presided over one of the fastestgrowing and strongest economies in the islands history due in part to a growth in tourism from a booming japanese economy he launched an austerity program at the start of his term and followed it with a program to encourage investment and trade from asia he eliminated the government deficit in three years despite a decrease in federal spending guams economy doubled and some 25000 new jobs were created a majority of these jobs were in guams growing private sector during adas first term private sector employment outstripped public sector employment in guams economy for the first time in the modern era as chairperson of the commission on selfdetermination established in 1980 to lead the way toward determining a new political status for guam ada presided over the completion of the guam commonwealth act and presented to the people of guam for approval in a plebiscite upon the acts approval ada took it to us congress a strong advocate for selfgovernment and selfdetermination for guam he called for an end to guams colonial status and pushed for the liberation of guams economy from federal regulations congress however did not act on the guam commonwealth act and guams political status remains unresolved ada believed that guam needed to be financially healthy and not dependent on the us government in order to move forward politically he said the federal government has tied guams hands more than once pointing to postwar security clearance federal land takings for us bases and the jones act which puts guam at a financial disadvantage for shipping to address those concerns ada said he supported the newly developed qualifying certificate program at the guam economic development authority to bring in foreign investment pushed for good fuel rates and port lease fees to bring tuna transshipment to guam and worked on getting a visa waiver for visitors to guam from korea and taiwan all of which helped move guam away from being dependent on us federal dollars he also directed floating the first bond for infrastructure rather than ask for more federal funds second termedit in his second term ada capitalized on the fruits of his economic recovery program and made the largest investment in education in guam up to that time he directed the floating of a bond which made some 170 million available for the construction of a new high school in southern guam now guam southern high school new elementary schools in tamuning inarajan and dededo and reconstruction of schools in upi and ordotchalan pago additionally many new classrooms were built to relieve overcrowding in schools around the island operating budgets for the public schools were increased annually under ada computers and computer classes were introduced in all guam schools at the end of his term every grade level in every school had access to computer classes guam suffered from a string of natural disasters during the second ada administration four typhoons one after another hit guam in 1991 with typhoon omar causing the most damage on 8 august 1993 guam was rocked by a very large earthquake measuring 78 on the moment magnitude scale the shock had a maximum mercalli intensity of viii severe damage ran into millions of dollars though only two buildings were destroyed these disasters combined with a recession in japan caused the tourism industry to suffer for a time camachomoylan administrationedit camachomoylan went on to defeat speaker antonio tony unpingco with his running mate eddie baza calvo as a future governor in the republican primary election on august 31 2002 and ran against guam delegate robert a underwood and his running mate senator thomas tom c ada for general election in 2002 camacho teamed up with fellow senator kaleo moylan to run for guams governor and lieutenant governor and defeated democratic contenders guam delegate robert underwood and senator thomas tom ada guam was slammed by super typhoon pongsona on 8 december 2003 shortly after camacho and moylan were elected into office they opted not to have a formal inaugural celebration due to the state of the island and instead chose to be sworn in with a ceremony at the plaza de españa at midnight after a celebratory mass at the dulce nombre de maria cathedral basilica in hagåtña – all under candle light the storm just six months after another strong typhoon chata’an hit the island left the island reeling the hospital the schools the airport the seaport hotels along with hundreds of homes and businesses had all been severely damaged the damages were estimated at 246 million by the federal emergency management agencythe largest natural disaster in us history holding that record until hurricane katrina in 2005 fuel tanks at the cabras island caught on fire making it unsafe for ships to come into the harbor the guam telephone authority and ab won pat international airport were also shut down for a time soon though approximately 10000 tourists who had been on guam since before the storm were able to go home camacho and his administration worked on getting the power water communications and transportation systems running again as well as reopening the islands schools and getting assistance to people with typhoon damaged homes and businesses tourism went down to a minimum and the government was essentially bankrupt the camacho administration had other challenges to governing guam as well due to concerns about the way the previous administration had handled government affairs the guam legislature enacted legislation to remove power from the office of the governor in several ways for the first time guam had an elected attorney general and an elected auditor there was also an elected school board and appointed superintendent of education who had complete authority over the largest government agency the guam department of education likewise for the first time the people of guam had elected a board to run the governments utilities the consolidated utilities commission took management of the power and water out of the governors hands the public utilities commission also set utility rates and the guam telephone authority was sold to a private company in 2005 the last government owned telephone exchange in the united states taking even more government responsibility away from the administration the court imposed penalties of more than 286 million against the government for failing to abide by the mandates of the consent decree ultimately the federal court appointed a receiver to enforce the terms of the consent decree and assume all the functions of the solid waste management division of the department of public works the court ordered the government to deposit 20 million into an account while the government with the court appointed receiver worked out a financing option for the consent decree projects when a viable financing option was not presented to the court the court ordered the government to deposit 993700 on a weekly basis into the account eventually the court suspended the weekly payments when the government issued bonds totaling 202 million for the consent decree projects in 2001 a group of mentally ill individuals who lived on guam filed suit against camachos predecessor governor gutierrez for failure to provide communitybased living services to the mentally ill the court found that defendants had discriminated against plaintiffs by requiring them to reside in the adult inpatient units to receive services and that the services provided to plaintiffs were not appropriate to their particular needs additionally the court found that the defendants had violated the plaintiffs constitutional rights to minimum standards of care and appointed a federal management team in 2010 in 2004 a class action lawsuit was filed against camacho claiming refunds of approximately 112 million as a result of the earned income tax credit the complaint was amended in 2006 wherein the class asked for approximately 135 million the parties settled the case for 90 million in anticipation of the courts approval of the settlement agreement the camacho administration managed to set aside millions of dollars in order to begin payments according to the terms of the settlement agreement camachocruz administrationedit due to various disagreements with moylan during their first term camacho picked freshman senator michael w cruz as his running mate in 2006 camacho again defeated robert underwood this time with senator frank aguon jr as running mate to win the governorship for a second term10 in 2006 the news reached guam that a large contingent of us marines were to be relocated to guam from okinawa at the same time guam was being considered to be home port for an aircraft carrier a defense shield system and as the host to a larger us air force presence as many as 70000 new people would possibly move to the island some only for the buildup period but many other would make guam their home permanently all of these plans were tentative – requiring studies and analysis the camacho administration began meeting with us defense officials to discuss the implications the buildup would have on the island before long those meetings and studies became highly politicized as certain senators wanted to be included in the planning meetings but were not upon receiving news of the department of defense agreement with the government of japan camacho created a civilian military task force to begin a detailed planning effort that continued throughout his second term letters resolutions petitions and news releases as well as scoping meetings at various locations around the island brought more attention to the matter than any other issue during camachos term more than 10000 people turned in comments on the environmental impact statement about the military buildup describing their concerns a first for guam calvo–tenorio administrationedit on april 30 2010 calvo announced that he would leave the legislature at the end of his present term in the same speech calvo simultaneously told supporters at chamorro village that he intended to seek the republican nomination for governor of guam in 2010 he chose senator ray tenorio as his running mate calvotenorio went on to defeat lieutenant governor michael cruz in the republican primary election on september 4 2010 and ran against former democratic governor carl gutierrez and his running mate senator frank aguon the calvotenorio ticket won the 2010 gubernatorial election by a slim margin and although the final count was enough to win the election it was still within 2 of the guiterrez aguon ticket immediately after the election a recount was ordered by the guam election commission in march 2012 he endorsed mitt romney for president the calvo–tenorio team ran for a second term in 2014 general election against the democratic team of former
