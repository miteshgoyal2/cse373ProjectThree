backward compatibility master systema predecessor master system successor sega saturn the sega genesis known as the mega driveb in regions outside of north america is a 16bit home video game console which was developed and sold by sega enterprises ltd the genesis was segas third console and the successor to the master system sega first released the console as the mega drive in japan in 1988 followed by a north american debut under the genesis moniker in 1989 in 1990 the console was distributed as the mega drive by virgin mastertronic in europe by ozisoft in australasia and by tectoy in brazil in south korea the systems were distributed by samsung and were known as the super gamboy and later the super aladdin boyc designed by an rd team supervised by hideki sato and masami ishikawa the hardware was adapted from segas system 16 arcade board centered on a motorola 68000 processor as a primary cpu and a zilog z80 as a secondary processor the system supports a library of more than 900 games created both by sega and a wide array of thirdparty publishers and delivered on rombased cartridges it can play master system games when the separately sold power base converter is inserted the genesis has benefited from several peripherals and network services as well as multiple firstparty and thirdparty variations of the console that focus on extending its functionality in japan the mega drive did not fare well against its two main competitors nintendos super famicom and necs pc engine but achieved considerable success in north america brazil and europe contributing to its success were its library of arcade game ports the popularity of the genesisexclusive sonic the hedgehog series several popular sports game franchises and aggressive youth marketing that positioned the system as the cool console for adolescents the release of the super nintendo entertainment system two years after the genesis resulted in a fierce battle for market share in the united states and europe that has often been termed as a console war by journalists and historians23 as this contest drew increasing attention to the video game industry among the general public the genesis and several of its highestprofile games attracted significant legal scrutiny on matters involving reverse engineering and video game violence controversy surrounding violent titles such as night trap and mortal kombat led sega to create the videogame rating council a predecessor to the entertainment software rating board the genesis sold over 30 million units worldwide in addition tectoy sold an estimated three million licensed variants in brazil majesco projected it would sell 15 million licensed variants of the system in the united states and much smaller numbers were sold by samsung in south korea the console and its games continue to be popular among game fans game music fans collectors and emulation enthusiasts by the mid 2010s licensed third party rereleases of the console were still being sold by atgames in north america and europe many games have been rereleased in compilations for newer consoles and offered for download on various online services such as the virtual console xbox live

top five arcade game manufacturers active in the united states as company revenues surpassed 200 million between july 1981 and june 19824 a downturn in the arcade business starting in 1982 seriously hurt the company leading gulf western to sell its north american arcade manufacturing organization and the licensing rights for its arcade games to bally manufacturing56 the company retained segas north american rd operation as well as its japanese subsidiary sega enterprises ltd with its arcade business in decline gulf western executives turned to sega enterprises ltds president hayao nakayama for advice on how to proceed nakayama advocated that the company leverage its hardware expertise gained through years working in the arcade industry to move into the home console market in japan which was in its infancy at the time7 nakayama received permission to proceed with this project leading to the release of segas first home video game system the sg1000 in july 1983 the sg1000 was not successful and was replaced by the sega mark iii within two years8 in the meantime gulf western began to divest itself of its noncore businesses after the death of company founder charles bluhdorn9 so nakayama and former sega ceo david rosen arranged a management buyout of the japanese subsidiary in 1984 with financial backing from csk corporation a prominent japanese software company nakayama was then installed as ceo of the new sega enterprises ltd10 in 1986 sega redesigned the mark iii for release in north america as the sega master system this was followed by a european release the next year although the master system was a success in europe and later in brazil it failed to ignite significant interest in the japanese or north american markets which by the midtolate 1980s were both dominated by nintendo111213 with sega continuing to have difficulty penetrating the home market segas console rd team led by masami ishikawa and supervised by hideki sato14 began work on a successor to the master system almost immediately after that console launched1516 in 1987 sega faced another threat to its console business when japanese computer giant nec released the pc engine amid great publicity17 to remain competitive against the two more established consumer electronics companies ishikawa and his team decided they needed to incorporate a 16bit microprocessor into their new system to make an impact in the marketplace and once again turned to segas strengths in the arcade industry to adapt the successful sega system 16 arcade board into architecture for a home console1618 the decision to use a motorola 68000 as the systems main cpu was made late in development while a zilog z80 was used as a secondary cpu to handle the sound due to fears that the load to the main cpu would be too great if it handled both the visuals and the audio16 first announced in june 1988 in beep a japanese gaming magazine the developing console was referred to as the mark v but sega management felt the need for a stronger name after reviewing more than 300 proposals the company settled on mega drive in north america the name of the console was changed to genesis the reason for this change is not known but it may have been due to a trademark dispute18 launch the european pal version of the mega drive launched in 1990 later becoming the highestselling fourth gen console in europe sega released the mega drive in japan on october 29 1988 though the launch was overshadowed by nintendos release of super mario bros 3 a week earlier positive coverage from magazines famitsu and beep helped to establish a following but sega only managed to ship 400000 units in the first year in order to increase sales sega released various peripherals and games including an online banking system and answering machine called the sega mega anser18 nevertheless the mega drive was unable to overtake the venerable famicom19 and remained a distant third in japan behind nintendos super famicom and necs pc engine throughout the 16bit era20 sega announced a north american release date for the system on january 9 198921 at the time sega did not possess a north american sales and marketing organization and was distributing its master system through tonka dissatisfied with tonkas performance sega looked for a new partner to market the genesis in north america and offered the rights to atari corporation which did not yet have a 16bit system david rosen made the proposal to atari ceo jack tramiel and the president of ataris entertainment electronics division michael katz tramiel declined to acquire the new console deeming it too expensive and instead opted to focus on the atari st sega decided to launch the console through its own sega of america subsidiary which executed a limited launch on august 14 1989 in new york city and los angeles the sega genesis was released in the rest of north america later that year22 the european version was released in september 199023 at a price of gb₤189992425 the release was handled by virgin mastertronic which was later purchased by sega in 1991 and became sega of europe26 titles like space harrier ii ghouls n ghosts golden axe25 super thunder blade and the revenge of shinobi were available in stores at launch the console was also bundled with altered beast24 the mega drive and its first batch of games were shown at the 1990 european computer entertainment show eces in earls court27 between july and august 1990 virgin initially placed their order for 20000 mega drive units however the company increased the order by 10000 units when advanced orders have exceeded expectations and another 10000 units was later added following the consoles success at the eces event the projected number of units to be sold between september and december 1990 have eventually increased to 40000 units in the united kingdom alone28 other companies assisted in distributing the console to various countries worldwide ozisoft handled the mega drives launch and marketing in australia as it had done before with the master system29 in brazil the mega drive was released by tectoy in 199030 only a year after the brazilian release of the master system tec toy produced games exclusively for the brazilian market and began a network service for the system called sega meganet in 199531 in india sega entered a distribution deal with shaw wallace in the spring of 1995 in order to circumvent an 80 import tariff with each unit selling for inr₹180003233 samsung handled sales and distribution in korea where it was renamed the super gamboy and retained the mega drive logo alongside the samsung name34 it was later renamed super aladdin boy35 north american sales and marketing for the north american market former atari corporation entertainment electronics division president and new sega of america ceo michael katz instituted a twopart approach to build sales in the region the first part involved a marketing campaign to challenge nintendo headon and emphasize the more arcadelike experience available on the genesis36 summarized by slogans including genesis does what nintendont18 since nintendo owned the console rights to most arcade games of the time the second part involved creating a library of instantlyrecognizable titles which used the names and likenesses of celebrities and athletes such as pat riley basketball arnold palmer tournament golf james buster douglas knockout boxing joe montana football tommy lasorda baseball mario lemieux hockey and michael jacksons moonwalker1737 nonetheless it had a hard time overcoming nintendos ubiquitous presence in consumers homes38 tasked by nakayama to sell one million units within the first year katz and sega of america managed to sell only 500000 units18 in mid1990 nakayama hired tom kalinske to replace katz as ceo of sega of america although kalinske initially knew little about the video game market he surrounded himself with industrysavvy advisors a believer in the razor and blades business model he developed a fourpoint plan cut the price of the console create a usbased team to develop games targeted at the american market continue and expand the aggressive advertising campaigns and replace the bundled game altered beast with a new title sonic the hedgehog38 the japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan39 but all four points were approved by nakayama who told kalinske i hired you to make the decisions for europe and the americas so go ahead and do it18 magazines praised sonic as one of the greatest games yet made and segas console finally took off as customers who had been waiting for the release of the international version of nintendos super famicom— the super nintendo entertainment system or snes—decided to purchase a genesis instead38 nintendos console debuted against an established competitor while necs turbografx16 failed to gain traction and nec soon pulled out of the market40 in large part due to the popularity of sonic the hedgehog the sega genesis outsold the snes in the united states nearly two to one during the 1991 holiday season this success led to sega having control of 65 of the 16bit console market in january 1992 making it the first time nintendo was not the console leader since december 198541 to compete with nintendo sega was more open to new types of games than its rival but still tightly controlled the approval process for thirdparty games and charged high prices for cartridge manufacturing42 technicians from american thirdparty video game publisher electronic arts ea reverse engineered the genesis in 198943 following nearly one year of negotiations with sega in which ea requested a more liberal licensing agreement than was standard in the industry before releasing its games for the system44 the clean room reverse engineering was led by steve hayes and jim nitchals lasting several months before ea secretly began game development44 ea founder trip hawkins confronted nakayama with this information one day prior to the 1990 consumer electronics show ces noting that ea had the ability to run its own licensing program if sega refused to meet its demands sega relented and the next day eas upcoming genesis games were showcased at ces44 ea signed what hawkins described as a very unusual and much more enlightened license agreement with sega in june 1990 among other things we had the right to make as many titles as we wanted we could approve our own titles  the royalty rates were a lot more reasonable we also had more direct control over manufacturing43 after the deal was in place ea chief creative officer bing gordon learned that we hadnt figured out all the workarounds and sega still had the ability to lock us out noting it just would have been a public relations fiasco44 ea released its first two genesis games populous and budokan the martial spirit within the month43 the first genesis version of eas john madden football arrived before the end of 199043 and became what gordon called a killer app for the system44 taking advantage of the licensing agreement gordon and eas vice president of marketing services nancy fong created a visual identifier for eas genesis cartridges a yellow stripe on their left side added during manufacturing44 sega was able to outsell nintendo four christmas seasons in a row45 due to the genesis head start a lower price point and a larger library of games when compared to the super nintendo at its release46 sega had ten games for every game on snes and while the snes had an exclusive version of final fight one of segas internal development teams created streets of rage which had bigger levels tougher enemies and a wellregarded soundtrack46 ascii entertainment reported in the spring of 1993 that genesis had 250 titles versus 75 for super nintendo but limited shelf space meant that stores typically offered 100 genesis and 50 super nintendo titles the nes was still the leader with 300 titles and 100 on shelves47 segas advertising positioned the genesis as the cooler console46 and as its advertising evolved the company coined the term blast processing the origin of which is an obscure programming trick on the graphics hardware to suggest that its processing capabilities were far greater than those of the snes4849 a sony focus group found that teenage boys would not admit to owning a snes rather than a genesis50 with the genesis often outselling the snes at a ratio of 2151 nintendo and sega both focused heavily on impression management of the market even going to the point of deception with nintendo claiming it had sold more consoles in 1991 than it actually had and forecasting it would sell 6 million consoles by the end of 1992 while its actual us install base at the end of 1992 was only just more than 4 million units52 due to these tactics it was difficult to ascertain a clear leader in market share for several years at a time with nintendos dollar share of the us 16bit market dipping down from 60 at the end of 1992 to 37 at the end of 199353 sega claiming 55 of all 16bit hardware sales during 199454 and donkey kong country helping the snes to outsell the genesis from 1995 through 19974555565758 according to a 2004 study of npd sales data that presents year by year charts through 2001 the sega genesis was able to maintain its lead over the super nes in the american 16bit console market59 according to a 2014 wedbush securities report based on revised npd sales data the snes outsold the genesis in the us market60 sonic the hedgehog main article sonic the hedgehog character while sega was seeking a flagship series to compete with nintendos mario series along with a character to serve as a company mascot several character designs were submitted as part of a companywide contest including an animeinspired egg and a teal hedgehog with red shoes created by naoto ohshima that he called mr needlehouse61 mr needlemouse won the contest and was renamed sonic the hedgehog spawning one of the bestselling video game franchises in history6263 the gameplay of sonic the hedgehog originated with a tech demo created by yuji naka who had developed an algorithm that allowed a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix nakas original prototype was a platform game that involved a fastmoving character rolling in a ball through a long winding tube and this concept was subsequently fleshed out with ohshimas character design and levels conceived by designer hirokazu yasuhara64 sonics blue pigmentation was chosen to match segas cobalt blue logo and his shoes were a concept evolved from a design inspired by michael jacksons boots with the addition of the color red which was inspired by both santa claus and the contrast of those colors on jacksons 1987 album bad his personality was based on bill clintons can do attitude1656667 although katz and sega of americas marketing experts disliked the idea of sonic certain that it would not catch on with most american kids1768 kalinskes strategy to place sonic the hedgehog as the packin title paid off269 featuring speedy gameplay sonic the hedgehog greatly increased the popularity of the sega genesis in north america49 bundling sonic the hedgehog with the sega genesis is credited with helping sega gain 65 of the market share against nintendo1 trademark security system and sega v accolade main article sega v accolade after the release of the sega genesis in 1989 video game publisher accolade began exploring options to release some of their pc game titles onto the console at the time sega had a licensing deal in place for thirdparty developers that increased the costs to the developer according to accolade cofounder alan miller one pays them between 10 and 15 per cartridge on top of the real hardware manufacturing costs so it about doubles the cost of goods to the independent publisher70 to get around licensing accolade chose to seek an alternative way to bring their games to the genesis it did so by purchasing one in order to decompile the executable code of three genesis games such information was used to program their new genesis cartridges in a way that would allow them to disable the security lockouts on the genesis that prevented unlicensed games from being able to be played7172 this strategy was used successfully to bring ishido the way of stones to the genesis in 199073 to do so accolade had copied segas copyrighted game code multiple times in order to reverse engineer the software of segas licensed genesis games7475 an edition of the original model of genesis known as the genesis iii was the model at the center of sega v accolade for its incorporation of the trademark security system tmss as a result of piracy in some countries and unlicensed development issues sega incorporated a technical protection mechanism into a new edition of the genesis released in 1990 referred to as the genesis iii this new variation of the genesis included a code known as the trademark security system tmss which when a game cartridge was inserted would check for the presence of the string sega at a particular point in the memory contained in the cartridge if the string was present the console would run the game and would briefly display the message produced by or under license from sega enterprises ltd71 this system had a twofold effect it added extra protection against unlicensed developers and software piracy and forced the sega trademark to display when the game was powered up making a lawsuit for trademark infringement possible if unlicensed software were to be developed7275 accolade learned of this development at the winter consumer electronics show in january 1991 where sega showed the new genesis iii and demonstrated it screening and rejecting an ishido game cartridge72 with more games planned for the following year accolade successfully identified the tmss file it later added this file to the games hardball star control mike ditka power football and turrican72 in response to the creation of these unlicensed games sega filed suit against accolade in the united states district court for the northern district of california on charges of trademark infringement unfair competition and copyright infringement in response accolade filed a counterclaim for falsifying the source of its games by displaying the sega trademark when the game was powered up7476 although the district court initially ruled for sega and issued an injunction preventing accolade from continuing to reverse engineer the genesis accolade appealed the verdict to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit77 as a result of the appeal the ninth circuit overturned the district courts verdict and ruled that accolades decompilation of the sega software constituted fair use78 the courts written opinion followed on october 20 1992 and noted that the use of the software was nonexploitative although commercial7179 further the court found that the trademark infringement being required by the tmss for a genesis game to run on the system had been inadvertently triggered by a fair use act and was the fault of sega for having caused false labeling71 ultimately sega and accolade settled the case on april 30 1993 as a part of this settlement accolade became an official licensee of sega and later developed and released barkley shut up and jam while under license80 the terms of the licensing including whether or not any special arrangements or discounts were made to accolade were not released to the public81 the financial terms of the settlement were also not disclosed although both companies agreed to pay their own legal costs82 videogame rating council and congressional hearings on video game violence vrc ma13 rating as applied to mortal kombat for the genesis main article videogame rating council in 1993 the american media began to focus on the mature content of certain video games games such as night trap for the sega cd an addon received unprecedented scrutiny issues about night trap were brought up in the united kingdom with former sega of europe development director mike brogan noting that night trap got sega an awful lot of publicity  it was also cited in uk parliament for being classified as 15 due to its use of real actors83 this came at a time when sega was capitalizing on its image as an edgy company with attitude and this only reinforced that image19 the most controversial title of the year by far was midways mortal kombat ported to the genesis and snes by acclaim in response to public outcry over the games graphic violence nintendo decided to replace the blood in the game with sweat and the arcades gruesome fatalities with less violent finishing moves84 sega took a different approach instituting americas first video game ratings system the videogame rating council vrc for all its current systems ratings ranged from the family friendly ga rating to the more mature rating of ma13 and the adultsonly rating of ma1784 with the rating system in place sega released its version of mortal kombat appearing to have removed all the blood and sweat effects and toning down the finishing moves even more than in the snes version however all the arcades blood and uncensored finishing moves could be enabled by entering a blood code this technicality allowed sega to release the game with a relatively low ma13 rating85 meanwhile the tamer snes version shipped without a rating85 the genesis version of mortal kombat was well received by gaming press as well as fans outselling the snes version three or fourtoone848687 while nintendo was criticized for censoring the snes version of the game85 executive vice president of nintendo of america howard lincoln was quick to point out at the hearings that night trap had no such rating saying to senator joe lieberman furthermore i cant let you sit here and buy this nonsense that this sega night trap game was somehow only meant for adults the fact of the matter is this is a copy of the packaging there was no rating on this game at all when the game was introduced small children bought this at toys r us and he knows that as well as i do when they started getting heat about this game then they adopted the rating system and put ratings on it84 in response sega of america vice president bill white showed a videotape of violent video games on the snes and stressed the importance of rating video games at the end of the hearing lieberman called for another hearing in february 1994 to check on progress toward a rating system for video game violence84 as a result of the congressional hearings night trap started to generate more sales and released ports to the pc sega 32x and 3do according to digital pictures founder tom zito you know i sold 50000 units of night trap a week after those hearings84 although experiencing increased sales sega decided to recall night trap and rerelease it with revisions in 1994 due to the congressional hearings88 after the close of these hearings video game manufacturers came together to establish the rating system that lieberman had called for initially sega proposed the universal adoption of its system but after objections by nintendo and others sega took a role in forming a new one this became the entertainment software rating board an independent organization that received praise from lieberman84 with this new rating system in place nintendo decided its censorship policies were no longer needed and the snes port of mortal kombat ii was released uncensored85 32bit era and beyond in order to extend the life of the genesis sega released two addons to increase its capabilities a cdbased peripheral known as the sega cd megacd outside north america and a 32bit peripheral known as the sega 32x69 224 million sega cd units were sold worldwide89 and an estimated 665000 32x units were sold by the end of 199490 following the launch of the nextgeneration 32bit sony playstation and the sega saturn sales of 16bit hardware and software continued to account for 64 of the video game market in 199591 sega underestimated the continued popularity of the genesis and did not have the inventory to meet demand for the product9192 sega was able to capture 43 of the dollar share of the us video game market and claimed to have sold more than 2 million genesis units in 1995 while genesis software such as vectorman remained highly successful kalinske estimated that we could have sold another 300000 genesis systems in the novemberdecember timeframe92 nakayamas decision to focus on the saturn over the genesis based on the systems relative performance in japan has been cited as the major contributing factor in this miscalculation91 by contrast nintendo concentrated on the 16bit home console market as well as its successful handheld the game boy as a result nintendo took in 42 of the video game market dollar share without launching a 32bit console to compete directly with the playstation or the saturn91 following tensions with sega enterprises ltd over its focus on the saturn kalinske who oversaw the rise of the genesis in 1991 grew uninterested in the business and resigned in mid199693 sega sold 3075 million genesis units worldwide94 of these 358 million were sold in japan89 and sales in europe and the us are roughly estimated at 8 million95 and 18 million as of june 1997 at which time sega was no longer manufacturing the system respectively5896 in 1998 sega licensed the genesis to majesco entertainment in north america so it could rerelease the console majesco began reselling millions of formerly unsold cartridges at a budget price together with 150000 units of the second model of the genesis58 it released the sega genesis 397 projecting to sell 15 million units of the console by the end of 199858 an estimated 3 million genesis units were sold by tec toy in brazil9899 technical specifications european mega drive mainboard the main microprocessor is a 1632bit motorola 68000 cpu clocked at 76 mhz100 the console uses a zilog z80 subprocessor mainly used to control the sound hardware and provide backward compatibility with the master system the system has 72 kb of ram 64 kb of video ram and can display up to 61 colors101 at once from a palette of 512 the games are in rom cartridge format and inserted in the top102 the system produces sound using a yamaha ym2612 fm synthesizer and a texas instruments sn76489 psg the latter is integrated with the video display processor vdp the z80 processor is primarily used to control both sound chips to produce stereo music and sound effects most revisions of the original system contain a discrete ym2612 and a separate ym7101 vdp the functionality of these two chips was later integrated into a single custom asic fc1004 for the model 2 and later revisions102 the back of the model 1 console provides a radio frequency output port designed for use with antenna and cable systems and a specialized 8pin din port both of which provide video and audio output both outputs produce monophonic sound a headphone jack on the front of the console produces stereo sound103 on the model 2 the din port radio frequency output port and headphone jack are replaced by a 9pin minidin port on the back for composite video rgb and stereo sound and the standard rf switch104 earlier model 1 consoles have a 9pin extension port although this was removed in later production runs and is absent in the model 2 an edge connector on the bottomright of the console allows it to be connected to a peripheral105 peripherals sega genesis sixbutton controller the standard controller features a rounded shape a directional pad three main buttons and a start button sega later released a sixbutton version in 1993 this pad is slightly smaller and features three additional face buttons similar to the design of buttons on some popular arcade fighting games such as street fighter ii the third model of the controller mk1470 was released with the sega genesis model 3 with a switch between normal turbo and slow while also having the mode button sega released a wireless revision of the sixbutton controller the remote arcade pad106 the system is backward compatible with the master system the first peripheral released the power base converter master system converter in europe allows master system games to be played107 a second model the master system converter 2 was released only in europe for use with the mega drive ii106 other peripherals were released to add functionality the menacer is a wireless infrared light gun peripheral used with compatible games107 other third parties created light gun peripherals for the genesis such as the american laser games pistol and the konami justifier released for art creation software the sega mega mouse features three buttons and is only compatible with a few games such as eye of the beholder a foamcovered bat called the batterup and the teevgolf golf club were released for both the genesis and snes106 sega power base converter on a model 1 genesis in november 1993 sega released the sega activator an octagonal device that lies flat on the floor and translates the players physical movements into game inputs106108 several highprofile games including mortal kombat and street fighter ii special champion edition were adapted to support the peripheral the device was a commercial failure due mainly to its inaccuracy and its high price point106109 ign editor craig harris ranked the sega activator the third worst video game controller ever made110 both ea and sega released multitaps to allow more than the standard two players to play at once initially eas version the 4 way play and segas adapter the team player only supported each publishers titles in response to complaints about this sega publicly stated that we have been working hard to resolve this problem since we learned of it and that a new team player which would work with all multitap games for the console would be released shortly111 later games were created to work on both the 4 way play and team player106 codemasters also developed the jcart system providing two extra ports on the cartridge itself although the technology came late in the consoles life and is only featured on a few games112 sega planned to release a steering wheel peripheral in 1994 and the genesis version of virtua racing was advertised as being steering wheel compatible but the peripheral was cancelled113 network services sega mega modem peripheral which allowed access to the sega meganet service in its first foray into online gaming sega created sega meganet which debuted in japan on november 3 1990 operating through a cartridge and a peripheral called the mega modem this allowed mega drive players to play a total of seventeen games online a north american version dubbed telegenesis was announced but never released114 another phonebased system the mega anser turned the japanese mega drive into an online banking terminal18 in 1994 sega started the sega channel a game distribution system using cable television services time warner cable and tci using a special peripheral genesis players could download a title from a library of fifty each month and demos for upcoming releases games were downloaded to internal memory and deleted when the console was powered off the sega channel reached 250000 subscribers at its peak and ran until july 31 1998 well past the release of the sega saturn114 in an effort to compete with sega thirdparty developer catapult entertainment created the xband a peripheral which allowed genesis players to engage in online competitive gaming using telephone services to share data xband was initially offered in five us cities in november 1994 the following year the service was extended to the snes and catapult teamed up with blockbuster video to market the service but as interest in the service waned it was discontinued in april 1997115 game library see also list of sega genesis games an ingame screen shot of sonic the hedgehog taken from its first level green hill zone the genesis library was initially modest but eventually grew to contain games to appeal to all types of players the initial packin title was altered beast which was later replaced with sonic the hedgehog in 199118 top sellers included sonic the hedgehog its sequel sonic the hedgehog 2 and disneys aladdin116 during development for the console sega enterprises focused on developing action games while sega of america was tasked with developing sports games a large part of the appeal of the genesis library during the consoles lifetime was the arcadebased experience of its games as well as more difficult entries such as ecco the dolphin and sports games such as joe montana football18 compared to its competition sega advertised to an older audience by hosting more mature games including the uncensored version of mortal kombat18 initially the genesis suffered from limited thirdparty support due to its low market share and nintendos monopolizing practices notably the arcade hit street fighter ii by capcom initially skipped the genesis instead only being released on the snes however as the genesis continued to grow in popularity capcom eventually ported a version of street fighter ii to the system known as street fighter ii′ champion edition117 that would go on to sell over a million copies118 one of the biggest thirdparty companies to support the genesis early on was electronic arts trip hawkins founder and then president of ea believed the genesis faster drawing speed made it more suitable for sport games than the snes and credits eas success on the genesis for helping catapult the ea sports brand119 another thirdparty blockbuster for the system was the port of the original mortal kombat although the arcade game was released on the snes and genesis simultaneously the two ports were not identical the snes version looked more identical to the arcade game but the genesis version allowed players to bypass censorship helping make it the more popular port120 sega virtua processor the graphics produced by the sega virtua processor are comparable to those of nintendos super fx chip121 in order to produce more visually appealing graphics companies began adding special processing chips to their cartridges to effectively increase the consoles capabilities on the snes these are several dsp chips and risc processors which allow the console to produce faster and more accurate 3d and pseudo3d graphics in particular the super fx chip was designed to offload complex rendering tasks from the main cpu enabling it to generate visual effects that the console cannot provide on its own the chip was first used in star fox which renders 3d polygons in real time and super mario world 2 yoshis island demonstrated the ability to rotate scale and stretch individual sprites and manipulate large areas of the screen121 as these enhancements became more commonplace on the super nes the stock of existing genesis games began to look outdated in comparison sega began work on an enhancement chip to compete with the super fx resulting in the sega virtua processor this chip enables the genesis to render polygons in real time and provides an axis transformation unit that handles scaling and rotation virtua racing the only game released with this chip runs at a significantly higher and more stable frame rate than similar games on the snes121 the chip was expensive to produce and increased the cost of the games that used it at us100 virtua racing was the most expensive genesis cartridge ever produced two other games virtua fighter and daytona usa were planned for the svp chip but were instead moved into the saturns launch lineup121 there were plans to sell the svp chip as a separate upgrade module for the genesis122123 but this module was never released addons genesis model 2 with a sega cd 2 and 32x addons attached in addition to accessories such as the power base converter the sega genesis supports two addons that each support their own game libraries the first is the sega cd known as the megacd in all regions except for north america a compact discbased peripheral that can play its library of games in cdrom format124 the second is the sega 32x a 32bit peripheral which uses rom cartridges and serves as a passthrough for genesis games125 sega produced a custom power strip to fit the peripherals large ac adapters126 both addons were officially discontinued in 199656124125 sega cd main articles sega cd and list of sega cd games by 1991 compact discs had gained in popularity as a data storage device for music and software pcs and video game companies had started to make use of this technology nec had been the first to include cd technology in a game console with the release of the turbografxcd addon and nintendo was making plans to develop its own cd peripheral as well seeing the opportunity to gain an advantage over its rivals sega partnered with jvc to develop a cdrom addon for the genesis3127128 sega launched the megacd in japan3 on december 1 1991 initially retailing at jp¥49800129 the cd addon was launched in north america on october 15 1992 as the sega cd with a retail price of us2993 it was released in europe as the megacd in 1993129 in addition to greatly expanding the potential size of its games this addon unit upgraded the graphics and sound capabilities by adding a second more powerful processor more system memory and hardwarebased scaling and rotation similar to that found in segas arcade games3130 it provided batterybacked storage ram to allow games to save high scores configuration data and game progress127 an additional data storage cartridge was sold separately shortly after its launch in north america sega began shipping the sega cd with the packin game sewer shark a full motion video fmv game developed by digital pictures a company that became an important partner for sega3 touting the benefits of the cds comparatively vast storage space sega and its thirdparty developers produced a number of games for the addon that include digital video in their gameplay or as bonus content as well as rereleasing several cartridgebased games with highfidelity audio tracks124127 in 1993 sega released the sega cd 2 a smaller and lighter version of the addon designed for the genesis ii at a reduced price compared to the original124 a limited number of games were later developed that use both the sega cd and the sega 32x addons131 the megacd sold only 100000 units during its first year in japan falling well below expectations although many consumers blamed the addons high launch price it also suffered from a tiny software library only two titles being available at launch this was due in part to the long delay before sega made its software development kit available to thirdparty developers129 sales were more successful in north america and europe although the novelty of fmv and cdenhanced games quickly wore off as many of the systems later games were met with lukewarm or negative reviews in 1995 sega announced a shift in focus to its new console the saturn and discontinued all advertising for genesis hardware including the sega cd the addon sold 224 million units worldwide89 sega 32x main articles sega 32x and list of sega 32x games with the release of the sega saturn slated for 1995 sega began to develop a stopgap solution that would bridge the gap between the genesis and the saturn and would serve as a less expensive entry into the 32bit era132 at the winter consumer electronics show in january 1994 sega of america research and development head joe miller took a phone call from nakayama in which nakayama stressed the importance of coming up with a quick response to the atari jaguar one potential idea for this came from a concept from sega enterprises later known as project jupiter an entirely new independent console133 project jupiter was initially slated to be a new version of the genesis with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming saturn as well as with some limited 3d capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the sega virtua processor chip miller suggested an alternative strategy citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months134 at the suggestion from miller and his team sega designed the 32x as a peripheral for the existing genesis expanding its power with two 32bit superh2 processors135 the sh2 had been developed in 1993 as a joint venture between sega and japanese electronics company hitachi136 at the end of the consumer electronics show with the basic design of the 32x in place sega enterprises invited sega of america to assist in development of the new addon134 although the new unit was a stronger console than originally proposed it was not compatible with saturn games135 before the 32x could be launched the release date of the saturn was announced for november 1994 in japan coinciding with the 32xs target launch date in north america sega of america now was faced with trying to market the 32x with the saturns japan release occurring simultaneously their answer was to call the 32x a transitional device between the genesis and the saturn133 this was justified by segas statement that both platforms would run at the same time and that the 32x would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive saturn125 the 32x was released in november 1994 in time for the holiday season demand among retailers was high and sega could not keep up orders for the system135 more than 1000000 orders had been placed for 32x units but sega had only managed to ship 600000 units by january 1995125 launching at about the same price as a genesis console the price of the 32x was less than half of what the saturns price would be at launch132 notwithstanding the lower priced consoles positioning as an inexpensive entry into 32bit gaming sega had a difficult time convincing thirdparty developers to create games for the new system after an early run on the peripheral news soon spread to the public of the upcoming release of the sega saturn which would not support the 32xs games the saturn was released on may 11 1995137 four months earlier than its originally intended release date of september 2 1995138 the saturn in turn caused developers to further shy away from the console and created doubt about the library for the 32x even with segas assurances that there would be a large number of games developed for the system in early 1996 sega conceded that it had promised too much out of the 32x and decided to stop producing the system in order to focus on the saturn125 prices for the 32x dropped to 99 and cleared out of stores at 1995135 variations more than a dozen licensed variations of the sega genesismega drive have been released139 in addition to models made by sega alternate models were made by other companies such as majesco entertainment atgames jvc pioneer corporation amstrad and aiwa a number of bootleg clones were created during its lifespan18 firstparty models genesis second model genesis cdx genesis nomad teradrive in 1993 sega introduced a smaller lighter version of the console102 known as the mega drive 2 in japan europe and australiad and simply sold as genesis without the sega prefix in north america this version omits the headphone jack in the front replaces the avout connector with a smaller version that supports stereo sound and provides a simpler less expensive mainboard that requires less power105 sega released a combined semiportable genesissega cd unit called the genesis cdx marketed as the multimega in europe this unit retailed at 39995 in the us140 roughly 100 more than the individual genesis and sega cd units put together since the sega cd dropped its price to 229 half a year before141 and was bundled with sonic cd sega classics arcade collection and the sega cd version of ecco the dolphin142 the cdx features a small lcd screen that when the unit is used to play audio cds displays the current track being played143 with this feature and the systems lightweight build weighing two pounds sega marketed it in part as a portable cd player140 late in the 16bit era sega released a handheld version of the genesis called the genesis nomad its design was based on the mega jet a mega drive portable unit featured on airplane flights in japan as the only successor to the game gear the nomad operates on 6 aa batteries displaying its graphics on a 325inch 825mm lcd screen the nomad supports the entire genesis library but cannot be used with the sega 32x the sega cd or the power base converter144 exclusive to the japanese market was the teradrive a mega drive combined with a computer sega produced three arcade system boards based on the mega drive the system c2 the megatech and the megaplay which support approximately 80 games combined18 thirdparty models wondermega jvc model wondermega 2 amstrad mega pc genesis 3 firecore laseractive working with sega enterprises jvc released the wondermega on april 1 1992 in japan the system was later redesigned by jvc and released as the xeye in north america in september 1994 designed by jvc to be a genesis and sega cd combination with high quality audio the wondermegas high price 500 at launch145 kept it out of the hands of average consumers146 the same was true of the pioneer laseractive which requires an addon known as the megald pack developed by sega in order to play genesis and sega cd games although the laseractive was lined up to compete with the 3do interactive multiplayer the combined price of the system and the megald pack made it a prohibitively expensive option for sega players147 aiwa released the csdgm1 a combination genesissega cd unit built into a boombox several companies added the mega drive to personal computers mimicking the design of segas teradrive these include the msx models ax330 and ax990 distributed in kuwait and yemen and the amstrad mega pc distributed in europe and australia18 after the genesis was discontinued majesco entertainment released the genesis 3 as a budget version in 1998148 in 2009 atgames began producing two new variations the firecore which can play original genesis cartridges as well as preloaded games and a handheld console preloaded with 20 genesis games149 companies such as radica games have released various compilations of genesis and mega drive games in plugandplay packages resembling the systems controller150 rereleases and emulation a number of genesis and mega drive emulators have been produced including genem kgen genecyst vgen st0rm151 and gens152 the gametap subscription gaming service included a sega genesis emulator and had several dozen licensed genesis games in its catalog153 the console classix subscription gaming service includes an emulator and has several hundred sega genesis games in its catalog154 in addition to emulation a number of sega genesis games have been released on compilation discs for other video game consoles these include sonic mega collection and sonic gems collection for ps2 xbox and nintendo gamecube sega genesis collection for ps2 and psp and most recently sonics ultimate genesis collection known as the sega mega drive ultimate collection in pal territories for playstation 3 and xbox 360155156 during his keynote speech at the 2006 game developers conference nintendo president satoru iwata announced that sega was going to make a number of genesismega drive titles available to download on the wiis virtual console157 these games are available along with other systems titles under the wiis virtual console157 there are select sega genesis titles available on the xbox 360 through xbox live arcade such as sonic the hedgehog and sonic 2158 as well as games available via the playstation network159 and steam160 later releases on may 22 2006 north american company super fighter team released beggar prince a game translated from a 1996 chinese original161 it was released worldwide and was the first commercial genesis game release in north america since 1998162 super fighter team would later go on to release two more games for the system legend of wukong and star odyssey162 in december 2010 watermelon an american company released pier solar and the great architects the first commercial roleplaying video game specifically developed for the console since 1996163 and the biggest 16bit game ever produced at 64mb164 pier solar is the only cartridgebased game which can optionally use the sega cd to play an enhanced soundtrack and sound effects disc165 in 2013 independent programmer future driver inspired by the disney film wreckit ralph developed fixit felix jr for the genesis166 on december 5 2007 tec toy released a portable version of the sega genesismega drive with twenty builtin games167 another version called mega drive guitar idol comes with two sixbutton joypads and a guitar controller with five fret buttons the guitar idol game contains a mix of brazilian and international songs the console has 87 builtin games including some from electronic arts based on the mobile phone versions168 in 2009 chinese company atgames produced a sega genesismega drivecompatible console the firecore149 it features a toploading cartridge slot and includes two controllers similar to the sixbutton controller for the original genesis the console has 15 games builtin and is regionfree allowing cartridge games to run regardless of their region169 atgames produced a handheld version of the console170 both machines have been released in europe by distributing company blaze europe169 it was announced that tectoy has developed a new genesis console that not only looks almost identical to the original model of the sega genesis known as the genesis iii but also has a traditional cartridge slot and sd card reader which will be released in june 2017171 reception and legacy the sega genesis has often been considered among the best video game consoles ever produced in 2009 ign named it the fifth best video game console citing its edge in sports games and better home version of mortal kombat and lauding what some consider to be the greatest controller ever created the six button172 in 2007 gametrailers named the sega genesis as the sixth best console of all time in their list of top ten consoles that left their mark on the history of gaming noting its great games and solid controller and writing of the glory days of sonic the hedgehog173 in january 2008 technology columnist don reisinger proclaimed that the sega genesis created the industrys best console war to date citing sonic the hedgehog superior sports games and backward compatibility with the sega master system174 gamingexcellence also gave the sega genesis sixth place in 2008 declaring one can truly see the genesis for the gaming milestone it was175 at the same time gamedaily rated it ninth of ten for its memorable games176 in 2014 usgamers jeremy parish wrote that if the atari generation introduced video games as a shortlived 70s fad  and the nes generation established it into an enduring obsession for the young segas genesis began pushing the medium toward something resembling its contemporary form expounding that the system served as the key incubator for modern sports franchises made consoles truly international by providing western thirdparties previously put at a disadvantage by nintendos restrictive licensing policies with a more profitable alternative created an online subscription service that foreshadowed playstation plus more than 15 years early with the sega channel and played a key role in ensuring the vitality and future of the games industry by breaking nintendos nearmonopolistic hold on the us and awakening the uk to the merits of television gaming177 for his part kalinske highlighted segas role in developing games for an older demographic and pioneering the concept of the street date with the simultaneous north american and european release of sonic the hedgehog 2178179 john sczepaniak of retro gamer noted it was a system where the allure was born not only of the hardware and games but the magazines playground arguments climate and politics of the time18 sega of americas innovative marketing campaign for the genesis was widely emulated influencing to some extent the marketing of every competitor in the subsequent generation of gaming consoles180 see also sega portal video games portal
