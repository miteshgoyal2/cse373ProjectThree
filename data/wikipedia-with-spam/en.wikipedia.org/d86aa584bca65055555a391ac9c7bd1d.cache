for its coverage of the psa flight 182 jetliner collision with a small plane over north park27 1987 editorial writing san diego evening tribune editorial writer jonathan freedman for his editorials urging passage of the first major immigration reform act in 34 years28 2006 national reporting the san diego uniontribune and copley news service with notable work by marcus stern and jerry kammer for their disclosure of bribetaking that sent former rep randy duke cunningham to prison in disgrace29 they also received the george polk award30 for these stories 2009 editorial cartooning steve breen for his agile use of a classic style to produce wide ranging cartoons that engage readers with power clarity and humor criticismsedit copleys and platinum equityedit under the copleys ownership the newspaper had a reliably conservative editorial position endorsing almost exclusively republicans for elective office and sometimes refusing to interview or cover democratic candidates under platinum equity the newspapers editorial position skewed closer to the middle and showcased multiple viewpoints31 manchester and lynchedit when manchester and business partner john lynch took ownership in 2011 they were open about their desire to use the newspaper to promote their agenda of downtown development and politically conservative causes32 with lynch stating on kpbs radio that he and manchester wanted to be cheerleaders for all that is good in san diego33 lynch expanded on this position in 2012 saying we make no apologies we are doing what a newspaper ought to do which is to take positions we are very consistent—proconservative probusiness promilitary—and we are trying to make a newspaper that gets people excited about this city and its future34 this open promotion of certain viewpoints resulted in criticism from journalism professors and other newspaper editors who worried that negative news about topics such as the military and business might not be covered35 dean nelson director of the journalism program at point loma nazarene university argued now if youre saying were going to be the cheerleaders of the military why would you report on this guy thats taking bribes wheres the cheerleading there a reference to the uniontribunes pulitzer prize winning coverage of the duke cunningham bribery scandal36 a new york times writer added there is a growing worry that the falling value and failing business models of many american newspapers could lead to a situation where moneyed interests buy papers and use them to prosecute a political and commercial agenda that future appears to have arrived in san diego34 lynch said we totally respect the journalistic integrity of our paper and there is a clear line of demarcation between our editorials and our news our editor jeff light calls the shots however in november 2011 lynch told the sports editor that the sports pages should advocate for a new football stadium when a longtime sportswriter wrote skeptically about the idea he was fired34 downtown redevelopmentedit in january 2012 two months after manchester bought the ut the newspaper featured a frontpage proposal for downtown redevelopment to include a downtown football stadium and an expansion of the san diego convention center37 both properties are adjacent to hotels that manchester owns38 in september 2012 investigative newsource reporter brooke williams obtained articles that claimed lynch threatened port commissioner scott peters who was running for congress with a newspaper campaign to dismantle the unified port of san diego in emails obtained by williams lynch was quoted as indicating that if the dole food company obtained a longterm contract that the ports independence governance would be questioned in editorial coverage williams said the effort showed the extent to which the newspapers new owners will go to push their vision for a football stadium on the tenth avenue marine terminal39 endorsements and pollingedit during the 2012 mayoral election the owners of the ut donated to republican city council member carl demaios campaign40 and the newspaper ran several prominent editorials favoring demaio those endorsements were wrapped around the front section of the newspaper on a separate page as though they were even more important than the front page41 in october 2012 a poll was taken by the ut asking respondents to choose between demaio and democratic congressman bob filner in the mayoral election to be held in november a rival news outlet noted that employees of a newspaper television radio station marketing public opinion research company or the city of san diego—or who live with someone employed in one of those fields were excluded from the poll results which showed the republican leading the democrat 46 percent to 36 percent reporter kelly davis of sdcitybeatcom wrote common sense dictates that those votes by city employees or those living with them would swing in filners favor due to demaios longrunning feud with cityemployee unions but ut assignment editor michael smolens replied that city employees were excluded to avoid political entanglements in other parts of the ballot as well as in the mayors race4243 despite the newspapers efforts demaio lost to filner lynch handed daytoday operations off to another executive in february 201444 and editor jeff light became company president in
