death penalty in issue 14 resulted in the publication being banned in singapore10 wired cofounder louis rossetto claimed in the magazines first issue that the digital revolution is whipping through our lives like a bengali typhoon11 yet despite the fact that kelly was involved in launching the well an early source of public access to the internet and even earlier noninternet online experience
