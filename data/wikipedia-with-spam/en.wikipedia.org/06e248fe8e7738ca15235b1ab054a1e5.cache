against jews123 a person who holds such positions is called an antisemite antisemitism is generally considered to be a form of racism45 antisemitism may be manifested in many ways ranging from expressions of hatred of or discrimination against individual jews to organized pogroms by mobs state police or even military attacks on entire jewish communities although the term did not come into common usage until the 19th century it is now also applied to historic antijewish incidents notable instances of persecution include the rhineland massacres preceding the first crusade in 1096 the edict of expulsion from england in 1290 the massacres of spanish jews in 1391 the persecutions of the spanish inquisition the expulsion from spain in 1492 the cossack massacres in ukraine from 1648 to 1657 various antijewish pogroms in the russian empire between 1821 and 1906 the 1894–1906 dreyfus affair in france the holocaust in germanoccupied europe official soviet antijewish policies and arab and muslim involvement in the jewish exodus from arab and muslim countries the root word semite gives the false impression that antisemitism is directed against all semitic people eg including arabs and assyrians the compound word antisemite was popularized in germany in 18796 as a scientificsounding term for judenhass jewhatred7891011 and that has been its common use since then1213 contents 1

origin of antisemitic terminologies is found in the responses of moritz steinschneider to the views of ernest renan as alex bein writes the compound antisemitism appears to have been used first by steinschneider who challenged renan on account of his antisemitic prejudices ie his derogation of the semites as a race14 avner falk similarly writes the german word antisemitisch was first used in 1860 by the austrian jewish scholar moritz steinschneider 1816–1907 in the phrase antisemitische vorurteile antisemitic prejudices steinschneider used this phrase to characterise the french philosopher ernest renans false ideas about how semitic races were inferior to aryan races15 pseudoscientific theories concerning race civilization and progress had become quite widespread in europe in the second half of the 19th century especially as prussian nationalistic historian heinrich von treitschke did much to promote this form of racism he coined the phrase the jews are our misfortune which would later be widely used by nazis16 according to avner falk treitschke uses the term semitic almost synonymously with jewish in contrast to renans use of it to refer to a whole range of peoples17 based generally on linguistic criteria18 according to jonathan m hess the term was originally used by its authors to stress the radical difference between their own antisemitism and earlier forms of antagonism toward jews and judaism19 cover page of marrs the way to victory of germanicism over judaism 1880 edition in 1879 german journalist wilhelm marr published a pamphlet der sieg des judenthums über das germanenthum vom nicht confessionellen standpunkt aus betrachtet the victory of the jewish spirit over the germanic spirit observed from a nonreligious perspective in which he used the word semitismus interchangeably with the word judentum to denote both jewry the jews as a collective and jewishness the quality of being jewish or the jewish spirit202122 this use of semitismus was followed by a coining of antisemitismus which was used to indicate opposition to the jews as a peoplecitation needed and opposition to the jewish spirit which marr interpreted as infiltrating german culture his next pamphlet der weg zum siege des germanenthums über das judenthum the way to victory of the germanic spirit over the jewish spirit 1880 presents a development of marrs ideas further and may present the first published use of the german word antisemitismus antisemitism the pamphlet became very popular and in the same year he founded the antisemitenliga league of antisemites23 apparently named to follow the antikanzlerliga antichancellor league24 the league was the first german organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to germany and german culture posed by the jews and their influence and advocating their forced removal from the country so far as can be ascertained the word was first widely printed in 1881 when marr published zwanglose antisemitische hefte and wilhelm scherer used the term antisemiten in the january issue of neue freie presse the jewish encyclopedia reports in february 1881 a correspondent of the allgemeine zeitung des judentums speaks of antisemitism as a designation which recently came into use allg zeit d jud 1881 p 138 on 19 july 1882 the editor says this quite recent antisemitism is hardly three years old25 the related term philosemitism was coined around 1885citation needed usage from the outset the term antisemitism bore special racial connotations and meant specifically prejudice against jews213 the term is confusing for in modern usage semitic designates a language group not a race in this sense the term is a misnomer since there are many speakers of semitic languages eg arabs ethiopians and assyrians who are not the objects of antisemitic prejudices while there are many jews who do not speak hebrew a semitic language though antisemitism has been used to describe prejudice against people who speak other semitic languages the validity of such usage has been questioned262728 the term may be spelled with or without a hyphen antisemitism or antisemitism some scholars favor the unhyphenated form because if you use the hyphenated form you consider the words semitism semite semitic as meaningful whereas in antisemitic parlance semites really stands for jews just that29303132 for example emil fackenheim supported the unhyphenated spelling in order to dispel the notion that there is an entity semitism which antisemitism opposes33 others endorsing an unhyphenated term for the same reason include padraic ohare professor of religious and theological studies and director of the center for the study of jewishchristianmuslim relations at merrimack college yehuda bauer professor of holocaust studies at the avraham harman institute of contemporary jewry at hebrew university of jerusalem and james carroll historian and novelist according to carroll who first cites ohare and bauer on the existence of something called semitism the hyphenated word thus reflects the bipolarity that is at the heart of the problem of antisemitism34 objections to the usage of the term such as the obsolete nature of the term semitic as a racial term have been raised since at least the 1930s2435 definition though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against jews and according to olaf blaschke has become an umbrella term for negative stereotypes about jews36 a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions holocaust scholar and city university of new york professor helen fein defines it as a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes and in culture as myth ideology folklore and imagery and in actions—social or legal discrimination political mobilization against the jews and collective or state violence—which results in andor is designed to distance displace or destroy jews as jews elaborating on feins definition dietz bering of the university of cologne writes that to antisemites jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature that is their bad traits are incorrigible because of this bad nature 1 jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective 2 jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies 3 jews bring disaster on their host societies or on the whole world they are doing it secretly therefore the antisemites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial bad jewish character37 for sonja weinberg as distinct from economic and religious antijudaism antisemitism in its modern form shows conceptual innovation a resort to science to defend itself new functional forms and organisational differences it was antiliberal racialist and nationalist it promoted the myth that jews conspired to judaise the world it served to consolidate social identity it channeled dissatisfactions among victims of the capitalist system and it was used as a conservative cultural code to fight emancipation and liberalism38 caricature by cléandre france 1898 showing rothschild with the world in his hands bernard lewis defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice hatred or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest according to lewis antisemitism is marked by two distinct features jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others and they are accused of cosmic evil thus it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute jews without necessarily being antisemitic unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism39 there have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally the united states department of state states that while there is no universally accepted definition there is a generally clear understanding of what the term encompasses for the purposes of its 2005 report on global antisemitism the term was considered to mean hatred toward jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the jewish religion andor ethnicity40 in 2005 the european monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia now fundamental rights agency then an agency of the european union developed a more detailed working definition which states antisemitism is a certain perception of jews which may be expressed as hatred toward jews rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward jewish or nonjewish individuals andor their property toward jewish community institutions and religious facilities it also adds that such manifestations could also target the state of israel conceived as a jewish collectivity but that criticism of israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic it provides contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself including promoting the harming of jews in the name of an ideology or religion promoting negative stereotypes of jews holding jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual jewish person or group denying the holocaust or accusing jews or israel of exaggerating it and accusing jews of dual loyalty or a greater allegiance to israel than their own country it also lists ways in which attacking israel could be antisemitic and states that denying the jewish people their right to selfdetermination eg by claiming that the existence of a state of israel is a racist endeavor can be a manifestation of antisemitism—as can applying double standards by requiring of israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation or holding jews collectively responsible for the actions of the state of israel41 late in 2013 the definition was removed from the website of the fundamental rights agency a spokesperson said that it had never been regarded as official and that the agency did not intend to develop its own definition42 however despite its disappearance from the website of the fundamental rights agency the definition has gained widespread international use the definition has been adopted by the european parliament working group on antisemitism43 in 2010 it was adopted by the united states department of state44 in 2014 it was adopted in the operational hate crime guidance of the uk college of policing45 and was also adopted by the campaign against antisemitism46 and in 2016 it was adopted by the international holocaust remembrance alliance47 making it the most widely adopted definition of antisemitism around the world 1889 paris france elections poster for selfdescribed candidat antisémite adolphe willette the jews are a different race hostile to our own judaism there is the enemy see file for complete translation evolution of usage in 1879 wilhelm marr founded the antisemitenliga antisemitic league48 identification with antisemitism and as an antisemite was politically advantageous in europe during the late 19th century for example karl lueger the popular mayor of fin de siècle vienna skillfully exploited antisemitism as a way of channeling public discontent to his political advantage49 in its 1910 obituary of lueger the new york times notes that lueger was chairman of the christian social union of the parliament and of the antisemitic union of the diet of lower austria50 in 1895 a c cuza organized the alliance antisemitique universelle in bucharest in the period before world war ii when animosity towards jews was far more commonplace it was not uncommon for a person an organization or a political party to selfidentify as an antisemite or antisemitic in 1882 the early zionist pioneer judah leib pinsker wrote that antisemitism was a psychological response rooted in fear and was an inherited predisposition he named the condition judeophobia51 judeophobia is a variety of demonopathy with the distinction that it is not peculiar to particular races but is common to the whole of mankindjudeophobia is a psychic aberration as a psychic aberration it is hereditary and as a disease transmitted for two thousand years it is incurable in this way have judaism and antisemitism passed for centuries through history as inseparable companionshaving analyzed judeophobia as an hereditary form of demonopathy peculiar to the human race and having represented antisemitism as proceeding from an inherited aberration of the human mind we must draw the important conclusion that we must give up contending against these hostile impulses as we must against every other inherited predisposition translation from german52 in the aftermath of the kristallnacht pogrom in 1938 german propaganda minister goebbels announced the german people is antisemitic it has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the jewish race53 after the 1945 victory of the allies over nazi germany and particularly after the full extent of the nazi genocide against the jews became known the term antisemitism acquired pejorative connotations this marked a full circle shift in usage from an era just decades earlier when jew was used as a pejorative term5455 yehuda bauer wrote in 1984 there are no antisemites in the world nobody says i am antisemitic you cannot after hitler the word has gone out of fashion56 manifestations jews identified by the mandatory jewish badge and jewish hat being burned during the black death in 1348 antisemitism manifests itself in a variety of ways rené könig mentions social antisemitism economic antisemitism religious antisemitism and political antisemitism as examples könig points out that these different forms demonstrate that the origins of antisemitic prejudices are rooted in different historical periods könig asserts that differences in the chronology of different antisemitic prejudices and the irregular distribution of such prejudices over different segments of the population create serious difficulties in the definition of the different kinds of antisemitism57 these difficulties may contribute to the existence of different taxonomies that have been developed to categorize the forms of antisemitism the forms identified are substantially the same it is primarily the number of forms and their definitions that differ bernard lazare identifies three forms of antisemitism christian antisemitism economic antisemitism and ethnologic antisemitism58 william brustein names four categories religious racial economic and political59 the roman catholic historian edward flannery distinguished four varieties of antisemitism60 political and economic antisemitism giving as examples cicero61 and charles lindbergh62 theological or religious antisemitism sometimes known as antijudaism63 nationalistic antisemitism citing voltaire and other enlightenment thinkers who attacked jews for supposedly having certain characteristics such as greed and arrogance and for observing customs such as kashrut and shabbat64 and racial antisemitism with its extreme form resulting in the holocaust by the nazis65 louis harap separates economic antisemitism and merges political and nationalistic antisemitism into ideological antisemitism harap also adds a category of social antisemitism66 religious jew as christkiller economic jew as banker usurer moneyobsessed social jew as social inferior pushy vulgar therefore excluded from personal contact racist jews as an inferior race ideological jews regarded as subversive or revolutionary cultural jews regarded as undermining the moral and structural fiber of civilization gustavo perednik has argued that what he terms judeophobia has a number of unique traits which set it apart from other forms of racism including permanence depth obsessiveness irrationality endurance ubiquity and danger67 he also wrote in his book the judeophobia that the jews were accused by the nationalists of being the creators of communism by the communists of ruling capitalism if they live in nonjewish countries they are accused of doubleloyalties if they live in the jewish country of being racists when they spend their money they are reproached for being ostentatious when they dont spend their money of being avaricious they are called rootless cosmopolitans or hardened chauvinists if they assimilate they are accused of being fifthcolumnists if they dont of shutting themselves away6869 cultural antisemitism louis harap defines cultural antisemitism as that species of antisemitism that charges the jews with corrupting a given culture and attempting to supplant or succeeding in supplanting the preferred culture with a uniform crude jewish culture70 similarly eric kandel characterizes cultural antisemitism as being based on the idea of jewishness as a religious or cultural tradition that is acquired through learning through distinctive traditions and education according to kandel this form of antisemitism views jews as possessing unattractive psychological and social characteristics that are acquired through acculturation71 niewyk and nicosia characterize cultural antisemitism as focusing on and condemning the jews aloofness from the societies in which they live72 an important feature of cultural antisemitism is that it considers the negative attributes of judaism to be redeemable by education or by religious conversion73 religious antisemitism see also antijudaism christianity and antisemitism and islam and antisemitism execution of mariana de carabajal converted jew accused of a relapse into judaism mexico city 1601 religious antisemitism also known as antijudaism is antipathy towards jews because of their perceived religious beliefs in theory antisemitism and attacks against individual jews would stop if jews stopped practicing judaism or changed their public faith especially by conversion to the official or right religion however in some cases discrimination continues after conversion as in the case of christianized marranos or iberian jews in the late 15th century and 16th century who were suspected of secretly practising judaism or jewish customs60 although the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the judeochristian conflict other forms of antisemitism have developed in modern times frederick schweitzer asserts that most scholars ignore the christian foundation on which the modern antisemitic edifice rests and invoke political antisemitism cultural antisemitism racism or racial antisemitism economic antisemitism and the like74 william nichols draws a distinction between religious antisemitism and modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds the dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion a jew ceased to be a jew upon baptism from the perspective of racial antisemitism however the assimilated jew was still a jew even after baptism from the enlightenment onward it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards jews once jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance without leaving behind the old christian hostility towards jews the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable even before explicitly racist doctrines appear economic antisemitism the underlying premise of economic antisemitism is that jews perform harmful economic activities or that economic activities become harmful when they are performed by jews75 linking jews and money underpins the most damaging and lasting antisemitic canards76 antisemites claim that jews control the world finances a theory promoted in the fraudulent protocols of the elders of zion and later repeated by henry ford and his dearborn independent in the modern era such myths continue to be spread in books such as the secret relationship between blacks and jews published by the nation of islam and on the internet derek penslar writes that there are two components to the financial canards77 a jews are savages that are temperamentally incapable of performing honest labor b jews are leaders of a financial cabal seeking world domination abraham foxman describes six facets of the financial canards all jews are wealthy78 jews are stingy and greedy79 powerful jews control the business world80 jewish religion emphasizes profit and materialism81 it is okay for jews to cheat nonjews82 jews use their power to benefit their own kind83 gerald krefetz summarizes the myth as jews control the banks the money supply the economy and businesses—of the community of the country of the world84 krefetz gives as illustrations many slurs and proverbs in several different languages which suggest that jews are stingy or greedy or miserly or aggressive bargainers85 during the nineteenth century jews were described as scurrilous stupid and tightfisted but after the jewish emancipation and the rise of jews to the middle or upperclass in europe were portrayed as clever devious and manipulative financiers out to dominate world finances86 léon poliakov asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism because without the theological causes of the economic antisemitism there would be no economic antisemitism in opposition to this view derek penslar contends that in the modern era the economic antisemitism is distinct and nearly constant but theological antisemitism is often subdued87 an academic study by francesco d’acunto marcel prokopczuk and michael weber showed that people who live in areas of germany that contain the most brutal history of antisemitic persecution are more likely to be distrustful of finance in general therefore they tended to invest less money in the stock market and make poor financial decisions the study concluded that the persecution of minorities reduces not only the longterm wealth of the persecuted but of the persecutors as well88 racial antisemitism main article racial antisemitism jewish soviet soldier taken prisoner by the german army august 1941 at least 50000 jewish soldiers were shot after selectionclarification needed racial antisemitism is prejudice against jews as a racialethnic group rather than judaism as a religion89 racial antisemitism is the idea that the jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to their host nations in the late 19th century and early 20th century it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the eugenics movement which categorized noneuropeans as inferior it more specifically claimed that northern europeans or aryans were superior racial antisemites saw the jews as part of a semitic race and emphasized their noneuropean origins and culture they saw jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religioncitation needed racial antisemitism replaced the hatred of judaism with the hatred of jews as a group in the context of the industrial revolution following the jewish emancipation jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility with the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism a combination of growing nationalism the rise of eugenics and resentment at the socioeconomic success of the jews led to the newer and more virulent racist antisemitismcitation needed according to william nichols religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds the dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion a jew ceased to be a jew upon baptism however with racial antisemitism now the assimilated jew was still a jew even after baptism from the enlightenment onward it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards jews once jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance without leaving behind the old christian hostility towards jews the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable even before explicitly racist doctrines appear90 in the early 19th century a number of laws enabling emancipation of the jews were enacted in western european countries9192 the old laws restricting them to ghettos as well as the many laws that limited their property rights rights of worship and occupation were rescinded despite this traditional discrimination and hostility to jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by racial antisemitism encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as joseph arthur de gobineau and particularly his essay on the inequality of the human race of 1853–5 nationalist agendas based on ethnicity known as ethnonationalism usually excluded the jews from the national community as an alien race93 allied to this were theories of social darwinism which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings such theories usually posited by northern europeans advocated the superiority of white aryans to semitic jews94 political antisemitism the whole problem of the jews exists only in nation states for here their energy and higher intelligence their accumulated capital of spirit and will gathered from generation to generation through a long schooling in suffering must become so preponderant as to arouse mass envy and hatred in almost all contemporary nations therefore – in direct proportion to the degree to which they act up nationalistially – the literary obscenity of leading the jews to slaughter as scapegoats of every conceivable public and internal misfortune is spreading — friedrich nietzsche 1886 ma 1 47595 william brustein defines political antisemitism as hostility toward jews based on the belief that jews seek national andor world power yisrael gutman characterizes political antisemitism as tending to lay responsibility on the jews for defeats and political economic crises while seeking to exploit opposition and resistance to jewish influence as elements in political party platforms96 according to viktor karády political antisemitism became widespread after the legal emancipation of the jews and sought to reverse some of the consequences of that emancipation 97 conspiracy theories see also list of conspiracy theories § antisemitic conspiracy theories holocaust denial and jewish conspiracy theories are also considered forms of antisemitism9899100101102102103104 zoological conspiracy theories have been propagated by the arab media and arabic language websites alleging a zionist plot behind the use of animals to attack civilians or to conduct espionage105 new antisemitism main article new antisemitism starting in the 1990s some scholars have advanced the concept of new antisemitism coming simultaneously from the left the right and radical islam which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a jewish homeland in the state of israel106 and they argue that the language of antizionism and criticism of israel are used to attack jews more broadly in this view the proponents of the new concept believe that criticisms of israel and zionism are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind and they attribute this to antisemitism jewish scholar gustavo perednik has posited that antizionism in itself represents a form of discrimination against jews in that it singles out jewish national aspirations as an illegitimate and racist endeavor and proposes actions that would result in the death of millions of jews107 it is asserted that the new antisemitism deploys traditional antisemitic motifs including older motifs such as the blood libel106 critics of the concept view it as trivializing the meaning of antisemitism and as exploiting antisemitism in order to silence debate and to deflect attention from legitimate criticism of the state of israel and by associating antizionism with antisemitism misused to taint anyone opposed to israeli actions and policies108 indology main article indology german indologists arbitrarily identified layers in the mahabharata and bhagavad gita with the objective of fueling european antisemitism via the indoaryan migration theory109 this identification required equating brahmins with jews resulting in antibrahmanism109 history main article history of antisemitism the massacre of the banu qurayza a jewish tribe in medina 627 many authors see the roots of modern antisemitism in both pagan antiquity and early christianity jerome chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism110 prechristian antijudaism in ancient greece and rome which was primarily ethnic in nature christian antisemitism in antiquity and the middle ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times traditional muslim antisemitism which was—at least in its classical form—nuanced in that jews were a protected class political social and economic antisemitism of enlightenment and postenlightenment europe which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in nazism in the 20th century contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the new antisemitism chanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories ancient antisemitism which was primarily ethnic in nature christian antisemitism which was religious and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries111 ancient world the first clear examples of antijewish sentiment can be traced to the 3rd century bce to alexandria60 the home to the largest jewish diaspora community in the world at the time and where the septuagint a greek translation of the hebrew bible was produced manetho an egyptian priest and historian of that era wrote scathingly of the jews his themes are repeated in the works of chaeremon lysimachus poseidonius apollonius molon and in apion and tacitus112 agatharchides of cnidus ridiculed the practices of the jews and the absurdity of their law making a mocking reference to how ptolemy lagus was able to invade jerusalem in 320 bce because its inhabitants were observing the shabbat112 one of the earliest antijewish edicts promulgated by antiochus iv epiphanes in about 170–167 bce sparked a revolt of the maccabees in judea113238 in view of manethos antijewish writings antisemitism may have originated in egypt and been spread by the greek retelling of ancient egyptian prejudices114 the ancient jewish philosopher philo of alexandria describes an attack on jews in alexandria in 38 ce in which thousands of jews died115116 the violence in alexandria may have been caused by the jews being portrayed as misanthropes117 tcherikover argues that the reason for hatred of jews in the hellenistic period was their separateness in the greek cities the poleis118 bohak has argued however that early animosity against the jews cannot be regarded as being antijudaic or antisemitic unless it arose from attitudes that were held against the jews alone and that many greeks showed animosity toward any group they regarded as barbarians119 statements exhibiting prejudice against jews and their religion can be found in the works of many pagan greek and roman writers120 edward flannery writes that it was the jews refusal to accept greek religious and social standards that marked them out hecataetus of abdera a greek historian of the early third century bce wrote that moses in remembrance of the exile of his people instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life manetho an egyptian historian wrote that the jews were expelled egyptian lepers who had been taught by moses not to adore the gods edward flannery describes antisemitism in ancient times as essentially cultural taking the shape of a national xenophobia played out in political settings60 there are examples of hellenistic rulers desecrating the temple and banning jewish religious practices such as circumcision shabbat observance study of jewish religious books etc examples may also be found in antijewish riots in alexandria in the 3rd century bce the jewish diaspora on the nile island elephantine which was founded by mercenaries experienced the destruction of its temple in 410 bce121 relationships between the jewish people and the occupying roman empire were at times antagonistic and resulted in several rebellions according to suetonius the emperor tiberius expelled from rome jews who had gone to live there the 18thcentury english historian edward gibbon identified a more tolerant period in romanjewish relations beginning in about 160 ce60 however when christianity became the state religion of the roman empire the states attitude towards the jews gradually worsened james carroll asserted jews accounted for 10 of the total population of the roman empire by that ratio if other factors such as pogroms and conversions had not intervened there would be 200 million jews in the world today instead of something like 13 million122123

judaism portal judaism wikiproject judaism v t e in the late 6th century ce the newly catholicised visigothic kingdom in hispania issued a series of antijewish edicts which forbad jews from marrying christians practicing circumcision and observing jewish holy days124 continuing throughout the 7th century both visigothic kings and the church were active in creating social aggression and towards jews with civic and ecclesiastic punishments125 ranging between forced conversion slavery exile and death126 from the 9th century the medieval islamic world classified jews and christians as dhimmis and allowed jews to practice their religion more freely than they could do in medieval christian europe under islamic rule there was a golden age of jewish culture in spain that lasted until at least the 11th century127 it ended when several muslim pogroms against jews took place on the iberian peninsula including those that occurred in córdoba in 1011 and in granada in 1066128129130 several decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were also enacted in egypt syria iraq and yemen from the 11th century in addition jews were forced to convert to islam or face death in some parts of yemen morocco and baghdad several times between the 12th and 18th centuries131 the almohads who had taken control of the almoravids maghribi and andalusian territories by 1147132 were far more fundamentalist in outlook compared to their predecessors and they treated the dhimmis harshly faced with the choice of either death or conversion many jews and christians emigrated133134135 some such as the family of maimonides fled east to more tolerant muslim lands133 while some others went northward to settle in the growing christian kingdoms136 during the middle ages in europe there was persecution against jews in many places with blood libels expulsions forced conversions and massacres a main justification of prejudice against jews in europe was religious the persecution hit its first peak during the crusades in the first crusade 1096 hundreds or even thousands of jews were killed as the crusaders arrived137 this was the first major outbreak of antijewish violence in christian europe outside spain and was cited by zionists in the 19th century as indicating the need for a state of israel138 in the second crusade 1147 the jews in germany were subject to several massacres the jews were also subjected to attacks by the shepherds crusades of 1251 and 1320 as well as rintfleisch knights in 1298 the crusades were followed by expulsions including in 1290 the banishing of all english jews in 1394 the expulsion of 100000 jews in france139 and in 1421 the expulsion of thousands from austria many of the expelled jews fled to poland140 in medieval and renaissance europe a major contributor to the deepening of antisemitic sentiment and legal action among the christian populations was the popular preaching of the zealous reform religious orders the franciscans especially bernardino of feltre and dominicans especially vincent ferrer who combed europe and promoted antisemitism through their often fiery emotional appeals141 as the black death epidemics devastated europe in the mid14th century causing the death of a large part of the population jews were used as scapegoats rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells hundreds of jewish communities were destroyed in numerous persecutions although pope clement vi tried to protect them by issuing two papal bulls in 1348 the first on 6 july and an additional one several months later 900 jews were burned alive in strasbourg where the plague had not yet affected the city142 17th century during the midtolate 17th century the polish–lithuanian commonwealth was devastated by several conflicts in which the commonwealth lost over a third of its population over 3 million people and jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands the first of these conflicts was the khmelnytsky uprising when bohdan khmelnytskys supporters massacred tens of thousands of jews in the eastern and southern areas he controlled todays ukraine the precise number of dead may never be known but the decrease of the jewish population during that period is estimated at 100000 to 200000 which also includes emigration deaths from diseases and captivity in the ottoman empire called jasyr143144 european immigrants to the united states brought antisemitism to the country as early as the 17th century peter stuyvesant the dutch governor of new amsterdam implemented plans to prevent jews from settling in the city during the colonial era the american government limited the political and economic rights of jews it was not until the american revolutionary war that jews gained legal rights including the right to vote however even at their peak the restrictions on jews in the united states were never as stringent as they had been in europe145 in the zaydi imamate of yemen jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century which culminated in the general expulsion of all jews from places in yemen to the arid coastal plain of tihamah and which became known as the mawza exile146 enlightenment in 1744 frederick ii of prussia limited the number of jews allowed to live in breslau to only ten socalled protected jewish families and encouraged a similar practice in other prussian cities in 1750 he issued the revidiertes general privilegium und reglement vor die judenschaft the protected jews had an alternative to either abstain from marriage or leave berlin quoting simon dubnow in the same year archduchess of austria maria theresa ordered jews out of bohemia but soon reversed her position on the condition that jews pay for their readmission every ten years this extortion was known as malkegeld queens money in 1752 she introduced the law limiting each jewish family to one son in 1782 joseph ii abolished most of these persecution practices in his toleranzpatent on the condition that yiddish and hebrew were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled moses mendelssohn wrote that such a tolerance is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution thousands of jews were slaughtered by cossack haidamaks in the 1768 massacre of uman in 1772 the empress of russia catherine ii forced the jews of the pale of settlement to stay in their shtetls and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the partition of poland147 a decree by emperor nicholas i of russia in 1827 made compulsory for jews under 18 years of age to be drafted to cantonist schools for a 25year military service in order to become baptised148 according to arnold ages voltaires lettres philosophiques dictionnaire philosophique and candide to name but a few of his better known works are saturated with comments on jews and judaism and the vast majority are negative149 paul h meyer adds there is no question but that voltaire particularly in his latter years nursed a violent hatred of the jews and it is equally certain that his animositydid have a considerable impact on public opinion in france150 thirty of the 118 articles in voltaires dictionnaire philosophique concerned jews and described them in consistently negative ways151 islamic antisemitism in the 19th century historian martin gilbert writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of jews worsened in muslim countries benny morris writes that one symbol of jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stonethrowing at jews by muslim children morris quotes a 19thcentury traveler i have seen a little fellow of six years old with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four teaching them to throw stones at a jew and one little urchin would with the greatest coolness waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his jewish gaberdine to all this the jew is obliged to submit it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a mahommedan152 in the middle of the 19th century j j benjamin wrote about the life of persian jews describing conditions and beliefs that went back to the 16th century …they are obliged to live in a separate part of town… under the pretext of their being unclean they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street inhabited by mussulmans they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…153 secular or racial antisemitism in 1850 the german composer richard wagner – who has been called the inventor of modern antisemitism154 – published das judenthum in der musik roughly jewishness in music154 under a pseudonym in the neue zeitschrift für musik the essay began as an attack on jewish composers particularly wagners contemporaries and rivals felix mendelssohn and giacomo meyerbeer but expanded to accuse jews of being a harmful and alien element in german culture who corrupted morals and were in fact parasites incapable of creating truly german art the crux was of course the manipulation and control by the jews of the money economy154 according to the present constitution of this world the jew in truth is already more than emancipated he rules and will rule so long as money remains the power before which all our doings and our dealings lose their force154 although originally published anonymously when the essay was republished 19 years later in 1869 the concept of the corrupting jew had become so widely held that wagners name was affixed to it154 antisemitism can also be found in many of the grimms fairy tales by jacob and wilhelm grimm published from 1812 to 1857 it is mainly characterized by jews being the villain of a story such as in the good bargain der gute handel and the jew among thorns der jude im dorn the middle 19th century saw continued official harassment of the jews especially in eastern europe under czarist influence for example in 1846 80 jews approached the governor in warsaw to retain the right to wear their traditional dress but were immediately rebuffed by having their hair and beards forcefully cut at their own expense155 in america even such influential figures as walt whitman tolerated bigotry toward the jews during his time as editor of the brooklyn eagle 1846–1848 the newspaper published historical sketches casting jews in a bad light156 the dreyfus affair was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century alfred dreyfus a jewish artillery captain in the french army was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the germans as a result of these charges dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment on devils island the actual spy marie charles esterhazy was acquitted the event caused great uproar among the french with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether dreyfus was actually guilty or not émile zola accused the army of corrupting the french justice system however general consensus held that dreyfus was guilty 80 of the press in france condemned him this attitude among the majority of the french population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period157 adolf stoecker 1835–1909 the lutheran court chaplain to kaiser wilhelm i founded in 1878 an antisemitic antiliberal political party called the christian social party158159 this party always remained small and its support dwindled after stoeckers death with most of its members eventually joining larger conservative groups such as the german national peoples party some scholars view karl marxs essay on the jewish question as antisemitic and argue that he often used antisemitic epithets in his published and private writings160161162 these scholars argue that marx equated judaism with capitalism in his essay helping to spread that idea some further argue that the essay influenced national socialist as well as soviet and arab antisemites163164165 marx himself had jewish ancestry and albert lindemann and hyam maccoby have suggested that he was embarrassed by it166167 others argue that marx consistently supported prussian jewish communities struggles to achieve equal political rights these scholars argue that on the jewish question is a critique of bruno bauers arguments that jews must convert to christianity before being emancipated and is more generally a critique of liberal rights discourses and capitalism168169170171 iain hamphshermonk wrote that this work on the jewish question has been cited as evidence for marxs supposed antisemitism but only the most superficial reading of it could sustain such an interpretation172 david mclellan and francis wheen argue that readers should interpret on the jewish question in the deeper context of marxs debates with bruno bauer author of the jewish question about jewish emancipation in germany wheen says that those critics who see this as a foretaste of mein kampf overlook one essential point in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping the essay was actually written as a defense of the jews it was a retort to bruno bauer who had argued that jews should not be granted full civic rights and freedoms unless they were baptised as christians173 according to mclellan marx used the word judentum colloquially as meaning commerce arguing that germans must be emancipated from the capitalist mode of production not judaism or jews in particular mclellan concludes that readers should interpret the essays second half as an extended pun at bauers expense174 20th century see also jewish bolshevism and racial policy of nazi germany the victims of a 1905 pogrom in yekaterinoslav between 1900 and 1924 approximately 175 million jews migrated to america the bulk from eastern europe before 1900 american jews had always amounted to less than 1 of americas total population but by 1930 jews formed about 35 this increase combined with the upward social mobility of some jews contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism in the first half of the 20th century in the usa jews were discriminated against in employment access to residential and resort areas membership in clubs and organizations and in tightened quotas on jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities the lynching of leo frank by a mob of prominent citizens in marietta georgia in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the united states175 the case was also used to build support for the renewal of the ku klux klan which had been inactive since 1870176 at the beginning of the 20th century the beilis trial in russia represented incidents of bloodlibel in europe christians used allegations of jews killing christians as a justification for the killing of jews antisemitism in america reached its peak during the interwar period the pioneer automobile manufacturer henry ford propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper the dearborn independent published by ford from 1919 to 1927 the radio speeches of father coughlin in the late 1930s attacked franklin d roosevelts new deal and promoted the notion of a jewish financial conspiracy some prominent politicians shared such views louis t mcfadden chairman of the united states house committee on banking and currency blamed jews for roosevelts decision to abandon the gold standard and claimed that in the united states today the gentiles have the slips of paper while the jews have the lawful money177 in the early 1940s the aviator charles lindbergh and many prominent americans led the america first committee in opposing any involvement in the war against fascism during his july 1936 visit to germany lindbergh wrote letters saying that there was more intelligent leadership in germany than is generally recognized the german american bund held parades in new york city during the late 1930s where members wore nazi uniforms and raised flags featuring swastikas alongside american flags sometimes race riots as in detroit in 1943 targeted jewish businesses for looting and burning178 a wagon piled high with corpses outside the crematorium at the recently liberated buchenwald concentration camp 1941 decree of boris iii of bulgaria for approval of the antisemitic law for protection of the nation in germany nazism led adolf hitler and the nazi party who came to power on 30 january 1933 shortly afterwards

disgrace and stripped all german jews even quarter and halfjews of their citizenship their official title became subjects of the state180 it instituted a pogrom on the night of 9–10 november 1938 dubbed kristallnacht in which jews were killed their property destroyed and their synagogues torched181 antisemitic laws agitation and propaganda were extended to germanoccupied europe in the wake of conquest often building on local antisemitic traditions in the east the third reich forced jews into ghettos in warsaw kraków lvov lublin and radom182 after the invasion of the soviet union in 1941 a campaign of mass murder conducted by the einsatzgruppen culminated from 1942 to 1945 in systematic genocide the holocaust183 eleven million jews were targeted for extermination by the nazis and some six million were eventually killed183184185 antisemitism was commonly used as an instrument for settling personal conflicts in the soviet union starting with the conflict between joseph stalin and leon trotsky and continuing through numerous conspiracytheories spread by official propaganda antisemitism in the ussr reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the rootless cosmopolitan euphemism for jew in which numerous yiddishlanguage poets writers painters and sculptors were killed or arrested186187 this culminated in the socalled doctors plot 1952–1953 similar antisemitic propaganda in poland resulted in the flight of polish jewish survivors from the country187 after the war the kielce pogrom and the march 1968 events in communist poland represented further incidents of antisemitism in europe the antijewish violence in postwar poland has a common theme of blood libel rumours188189 21stcentury european antisemitism further information antisemitism in

death190191 a 2015 report by the us state department on religious freedom declared that european antiisrael sentiment crossed the line into antisemitism192 this rise in antisemitic attacks is associated with both the muslim antisemitism and the rise of farright political parties as a result of the economic crisis of 2008193 this rise in the support for far right ideas in western and eastern europe has resulted in the increase of antisemitic acts mostly attacks on jewish memorials synagogues and cemeteries but also a number of physical attacks against jews194 in eastern europe the dissolution of the soviet union and the instability of the new states has brought the rise of nationalist movements and the accusation against jews for the economic crisis taking over the local economy and bribing the government alongside with traditional and religious motives for antisemitism such as blood libels most of the antisemitic incidents are against jewish cemeteries and building community centers and synagogues nevertheless there were several violent attacks against jews in moscow in 2006 when a neonazi stabbed 9 people at the bolshaya bronnaya synagogue195 the failed bomb

brotherhood represent a contemporary mode of genocidal antisemitism208 causes this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it july 2011 antisemitism has been explained in terms of racism xenophobia projected guilt displaced aggression and the search for a scapegoat209 some explanations assign partial blame to the perception of jewish people as unsociable such a perception may have arisen by many jews having strictly kept to their own communities with their own practices and laws210 it has also been suggested that parts of antisemitism arose from a perception of jewish people as greedy as often used in stereotypes of jews and this perception has probably evolved in europe during medieval times where a large portion of money lending was operated by jews211 factors contributing to this situation included that jews were restricted from other professions211 while the christian church declared for their followers that money lending constituted immoral usury212 current situation

formation haj amin was far from being an antisemite he had learnt french at the alliance israélite universelle institute in jerusalem and albert antébi had been one of his mentors in the interwar period he had fought zionism as a political and religious leader he was then of the opinion that the aim of zionism was to expel the arabs of palestine and take over the haram alsharif in order to build the third temple gradually progressivement he was persuaded that world judaism supported zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decisionmaking in great britain and the united states for some time during ww2 he was certain based on real facts that the zionists were seeking to assassinate him … it is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in palestine with that of germany against world judaism the reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his european sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism with their two great themes of the identification of judaism with financial capitalism anglosaxons and of the legend of the stab in the back the jews as responsible for the two world wars on the other hand a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview … taken together his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of holocaust denial whilst arab
