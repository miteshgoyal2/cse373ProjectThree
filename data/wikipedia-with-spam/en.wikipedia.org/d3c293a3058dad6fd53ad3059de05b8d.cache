comments about thurmonds candidacy in a 1980 rally11 lott gave an interview with black entertainment television explaining himself and repudiating thurmonds former views12 in the wake of controversy lott resigned as senate republican leader on december 20 2002 effective at the start of the next session january 3 2003 bill frist of tennessee was later elected to the leadership position in the book
