industry formed the ifpi at the industrys first international congress in rome italy held from 10–14 november 19335 and registered its head office in zurich switzerland6 the ifpi described its mission as representing the interests of the recording industry worldwide in all fora7 by promoting legislation and copyrights8 and to protect the largely britishbased recording industry by promoting a global performance right in gramophone sound recordings9 phonogram copyrights establishededit the ifpi lobbied at the rome convention for the protection of performers producers of phonograms and broadcasting organisations of 1961 which established an international standard for the protection of sound recordings live performances and broadcasts this convention was opposed by trade groups representing authors and composers who were concerned that establishing such neighbouring rights would undermine their own control over how their works were used and would result in prohibitively expensive licensing10 pressure from united statesbased broadcasters who didnt want to license the records they broadcast among other factors kept the united states from signing the convention the united states would not recognise a separate sound recording copyright until 197111 phonogram copy protection effortsedit in an effort to combat copyright violation in 1971 the ifpi advocated for the convention for the protection of producers of phonograms against unauthorized duplication of their phonograms the geneva phonograms convention which 72 countries signed12 in 1986 the iso established the international standard recording code isrc standard iso 3901 in 1989 the ifpi was designated the registration authority for isrc codes isrc codes enable the use of copyright protected recordings and works to be controlled facilitate the distribution and collection of royalties performances private copying and assist in the fight against piracy13 to further combat infringement of recorded works the ifpi and the compact disc manufacturing industry introduced source identification sid codes in 1994 the sid codes are markings on optical discs such as compact discs cd and digital versatile discs dvd that identify the manufacturer equipment and master discs used to create each disc there are two codes the sid mastering code and the sid mould code the sid mastering code identifies the manufacturing facility used to produce a master from which moulds are produced the sid mould code identifies the plant where the disc was moulded replicated since not all optical disc manufacturing facilities have the ability to both produce master discs and replicate discs the sid mastering code and sid mould code on a given optical disc may or may not represent the same manufacturing facility1434 sid codes follow a standard format consisting of the letters ifpi followed by four or five hexadecimal digits a number prefaced with l is a mastering code a serial number taken from a pool assigned by philips to the manufacturer the mastering code identifies the laser beam recorder lbr signal processor or mould that produced a particular stamper or a glass master disc from which moulds are produced nonl numbers are mould codes which identify the manufacturer that replicated the disc phillips assigns the first 2 or 3 digits of the mould code and the remaining digits are a serial number assigned by that plant to its moulds1447 the pirate bay incidentsedit wikinews has related news pirate bay case internet group attacks websites in operation baylout in midoctober 2007 after the ifpi let the ifpicom domain registration lapse ownership of the ifpicom domain was transferred to the pirate bay a group which claimed it received the domain from an anonymous donor15 the group set up a website under the domain titled international federation of pirates interests a replacement backronym for ifpi ownership of the domain was returned to the ifpi in late november when a wipo arbitration panel concluded that the disputed domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark in which the ifpi has rights and that the pirate bays representative registered and was using the disputed domain name in bad faith and failed to adequately rebut the ifpis contention that he has no rights or a legitimate interest in the disputed domain name16 the organisations website wwwifpiorg was unaffected during the dispute in a separate incident on 18 february 2009 the swedish ifpise domain was hacked by the pirate bay supporters this occurred on the third day of the trial of the pirate bay founders in sweden the site was replaced with a short message directed at the prosecutor håkan roswall and plaintiffs warner brothers etc it was signed the new generation17 peter sunde of pirate bay made an appeal on twitter requesting that the hackers stop this defacement18 on 19 april 2009 after the announcement of an unfavorable swedish court decision against the pirate bay the ifpiorg and ifpise domains were reportedly subjected to a ddos attack the british technology news and opinion website the register and the copyright file sharing and digital rights focused news site torrentfreak speculated that the attacks were perpetrated by pirate bay supporters1920citation needed record sales certificationedit the ifpi awards two album sales certifications
