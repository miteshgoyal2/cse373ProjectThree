submission5 themes for stock photos are diverse although megan garber of the atlantic wrote in 2012 that one of the more wackywondrous elements of stock photos is the manner in which as a genre theyve

many stock photos document historical events newspapers and magazines were first able to reproduce photographs instead of line drawings in the mid1880s with the invention of the halftone printing press16 initially starting with staff photographers eventually independent freelance photographers took over16 one of the first examples of a stock photo was circa 1920 when american photographer h armstrong roberts ensured the people photographed in group in front of trimotor airplane all signed model releases this allowed the photograph and others like it to be commercially viable1 in an effort to save the cost of hiring photographers for commissionbased photo shoots publishers and advertisers began to consider stock photos as a less risky alternative7 one of the first major stock photography libraries7 was founded in 1920 by h armstrong robertscitation needed the bettman archive in new york is an example of an early traditional stock agency1 with the company delivering photos upon 24hour request to magazines such as look and life1 founded in 1936 by otto bettmann a german curator who emigrated to the united states in 193517 the bettman archive began with bettmanns personal collection of 15000 images which he brought with him in suitcases when he escaped from nazi germany18 he actively expanded his collection by placing ads in magazines for stills and photos17 a different early pioneer with the stock industry was photographer tony stone whose portfolio of mountain scenes proved popular with chocolate advertisers stones stock library eventually reached 20000 images each selected for its likelihood to sell multiple copies7 new indexing systems and growth 1940s1980sedit known as a stock resource for newspapers and magazines the hulton archive started as the photographic archive of picture post as the archive expanded through world war ii it became clear that its vast collection of photographs and negatives were becoming an important historical documentary resource in 1945 sir edward hulton set up the hulton press library as a semiindependent operation and commissioned charles gibbssmith of the victoria and albert museum to catalogue the entire archive using a system of keywords and classifications the gibbssmith system claims to be the world’s first indexing system for pictures and it was eventually adopted by the british museum collections6 expansion and transition online 1980s1990sedit by the 1980s stock photography had become a specialty in its own right with the stock industry advancing quickly7 as photo libraries transitioned from physical archives to servers in the mid1990s stock libraries were increasingly called stock agencies7 the archives also began to rely increasingly on keywords for sorting and retrieving photographs7 in 1991 photodisc in seattle washington began selling cd roms with packs of images unlike their competitors photodisc licensed the image packs as royalty free in contrast to the rights managed system royalty free allowed the purchaser of a cd rom to use the images as many times as they liked without paying further fees7 there was a great amount of consolidation among stock photo agencies89 between 1990 and the mid2000s with corbis notably acquiring the massive bettmann archive in 19951 after photodisc went online in 199519 in september 1997 photodisc agreed to combine with londonbased getty communications to form the seattlebased getty images20 in 1996 the hulton picture collection was bought by getty images for £86 million21 alamy registered as alamy

contributed by agencies and independent photographers or collected from news archives museums and national collections its suppliers include both professional and amateur photographers stock agencies news archives museums and national collections its clients are from the photography publishing and advertising industries and the general public recent developments 2000presentedit the early microstock company istockphoto was founded in may 2000 originally a free stock imagery website it transitioned into its current micropayment model in 200110 helping pioneer the subscriptionbased model of stock photography22 shutterstock was founded in 2003 with a monthly subscription fee23 online since 2000 as a royalty free stock photography website in 2004 dreamstime11 was founded as new microstock agency15 other stock agencies with new business models around this time included fotolibra which opened to the public in 20051213 and can stock photo which debuted in 200414 by 2007 dreamstime was competing with istockphoto fotolia and shutterstock all expanded into major microstock companies15 in 2013 crewco launched unsplash a free stock imagery website operating under their own version of a creative commons zero license24 in march 2013 microstock company depositphotos launched clashot25 a service that allows smartphone users instantly upload photos to the photobank from their devices following by fotolia that launched very similar fotolia instant 26 later that year between the 1990s and the mid2000s bill gates corbis images and getty images combined purchased more than 40 stock photo agencies1 istockphoto or istockcom was acquired by getty in 20067 in february 200927 jupitermedia corporation sold their online stock images division jupiterimages to getty images

companys shares reaching a 25 billion market value by late 201323 the stock photo company fotolia announced that it would be acquired by adobe for 800 million on december 11 201431 descriptionedit stock photography refers to the supply of photographs which are often licensed for specific uses such as magazine publishing or pamphletmakingcitation needed according to the new york times as of 2005 most book cover designers prefer stock photography agencies over photographers in efforts to save costs publishers can then purchase photographs on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis32 established models of stock photography include macrostock highpriced and exclusive stock photography also known as traditional stock photography2 midstock stock photography priced between micro stock and macro stock which is often used online3 microstock lowpriced and inclusive stock photography in competition to traditional agencies microstock photography is a relatively new model of stock photography which is available through agencies that sell images for lower prices but in greater volume4 according to the new york times conventional stock agencies charge from several hundred to several thousands american dollars per image and base fees on the published size of an image circulation and other factors microstock photos may sell for as little as usd 25 cents4 professional stock photographers traditionally place their images with one or more stock agencies on a contractual basis with a defined commission basis and specified contract term the industry standard is purportedly 30 to 50 percent to the photographer although at the start of the stock photography industry fees were typically cut half and half between the agency and artist1 other stock agencies may accept the highquality photos of amateur photographers through online submission5 some online photo websites have created unique software to search for fitting stock photos for example searching for complicated keyword combinations color shapes and moods3334 other search engines may seek to quantify the best photos by looking for elements as diverse as bright lights evidence of emotional connections between people and the tilt of faces35 styles and trendsedit traditional stock photo agencies have large catalogues that may include press archives and works by notable photographers such as bert hardy bill brandt weegee and ernst haas36 more recent trends in microstock photography include lifestyle photographs of people at work and play4 food sports and fashion4 other stock photo themes may include stereotypes expressing common emotions and gesticulations petscitation needed and images related to travel and tourismcitation needed in the early 1990s the stock industry focused on conceptual images which could encapsulate themes such as global communication success and teamwork7 after the consolidation of many stock photo agencies in the 1990s and early 2000s new companies began focusing in niche collections including medical science minorities gay and lesbian lifestyles aviation maps panoramic historical sports and celebrity homes1 opined megan garber of the atlantic in 2012 one of the more wackywondrous elements of stock photos is the manner in which as a genre theyve developed a unifying editorial sensibility to see a stock image is potter stewartstyle to know youre seeing a stock image and while stock images stockiness may be in part due to the common visual tropes that give them their easy cheesy impact prettiness preciousness poseiness theres part of it thats more ephemeral too though they have little in common shots of a german shepherd typing on a laptop and a man contemplating the sunset can both be in their special way stocky5 types of stock photo licensesedit public
