perfection that michael sought in his music6 ashante infantry of toronto star said breaking news threatens to diminish the posthumous goodwill afforded the pop star and is a selfreferential rehash that spotlights all that was wrong with mike if michael is similarly disappointing jackson’s label and executors will find a limit to these breaking news lyrics – “no matter what you just want to read it againno matter what you just want to feed it again”10 darryl sterdan from qmi agency said the vocals on the verses of the selfreferential breaking news seem artificial as if they were recorded for
