norad tracks santa from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the emblem of norad tracks santa norad tracks santa is an annual christmasthemed entertainment program which has existed since 19551 produced under the auspices of the north american aerospace defense command norad every year on christmas eve norad tracks santa purports to track santa claus as he leaves the north pole and delivers presents to children around the world the program is in the tradition of the september 1897 editorial yes virginia there is a santa claus in the new york sun23 contents 1 history and overview 11 origin 12 recent history 2 website and other media 3 sponsorship and publicity 4 see also 5 references 6 external links history and overviewedit the 1955 sears ad with according to legend the misprinted telephone number that led to the norad tracks santa program harry shoup the santa colonel originedit on december 24 1948 the united states air force issued a communique claiming that an early warning radar net to the north had detected one unidentified sleigh powered by eight reindeer at 14000 feet 4300 meters heading 180 degrees the associated press passed this report along to the general public it was the first time that the united states armed forces issued a statement about tracking santa clauss sleigh on christmas eve although it was a onetime event not repeated over the next several years4 the program originated before the actual formation of norad as an annual event on december 24 1955 according to legend a sears department store placed an advertisement in a colorado springs colorado newspaper which told children that they could place a call to santa claus and included the number me 266815 a call allegedly came through to colorado springs continental air defense command conad center as one digit was misprinted6 in some versions of the story the calls were coming in to the red telephone hotline that connected conad directly to command authorities at the strategic air command colonel harry shoup who was a crew commander on duty answered the first call and supposedly told his staff to give all children who called in later a current location for santa claus7 a more accurate description of the events of 1955 appears to be that on november 30 a child trying to reach santa claus on a hotline number provided in a sears advertisement misdialed the number and instead reached shoup at his desk at conad shoup responded gruffly to the child and no additional santa clausrelated calls came in to conad48 however when a member of shoups staff placed a picture of santa claus on a board used to track unidentified aircraft that december shoup saw a public relations opportunity for conad and he asked conads public relations officer colonel barney oldfield to inform the press that conad was tracking santa clauss sleigh in his release to the press oldfield added that conad army navy and marine air forces will continue to track and guard santa and his sleigh on his trip to and from the us against possible attack from those who do not believe in christmas4 over the following years the legend of how the annual event originated began to change by 1961 shoups version of the story was that he had not been gruff with the child but instead had identified himself as santa claus when he spoke to the child on the phone shoup and his family later modified the story further adding that the child had dialed the red telephone – an impossibility because the hotline was connected with the strategic air command by an enclosed cable and no one could dial into from the outside – rather than the regular phone on shoups desk that it was a misprint in an advertisement that led the child to call him rather than the child misdialing the number and that a flood of calls had come in from children on christmas eve 1955 rather than from just one child on november 304 shoup did not intend to repeat the stunt in 1956 but oldfield informed him that the associated press and united press international were awaiting reports that conad again was tracking santa claus shoup agreed that oldfield should announce it again and the annual tradition was born47 in 1958 the north america air defense command norad took over the reporting responsibility from conad and the reporting became more elaborate as the years passed on december 24 1960 for example norads northern command post at sainthubert quebec canada provided regular updates of a sleigh operated by s claus which it identified as undoubtedly friendly during the evening norad reported that the sleigh had made an emergency landing on the ice of hudson bay where royal canadian air force rcaf interceptor aircraft sent to investigate discovered santa claus bandaging his reindeer dancers front foot after which the rcaf planes escorted him when he resumed his journey4 eventually norad which was renamed the north american aerospace defense command in 1981 openly published a hotline number for the general public to call to get updates on santa clauss progress4 recent historyedit today norad relies on volunteers to make the program possible9 each volunteer handles about forty telephone calls per hour and the team typically handles more than 12000 emails and more than 70000 telephone calls from more than two hundred countries and territories most of these contacts happen during the twentyfive hours from 2 am on december 24 until 3 am mst on december 2579 a website called noradsantaorg was established to allow project access for internet users10 google analytics has been in use since december 2007 to analyze website traffic as a result of this analysis information the program can project and scale volunteer staffing telephone equipment and computer equipment needs for christmas eve11 volunteers include norad military and civilian personnel12 in 2014 norad answered more than 100000 phone calls in 2015 more than 1200 us and canadian military personnel volunteered to staff the phone lines4 website and other mediaedit norad volunteers answering phone calls in 2007 the norad tracks santa program has always made use of a variety of media from the 1950s to 1996 these were the telephone hotline newspapers radio phonograph records and television many television newscasts in north america feature norad tracks santa as part of their weather updates on christmas eve from 1997 to the present the program has had a highly publicized internet presence as mobile media and social media have become popular and widespread as methods of direct communication these newer media have also been embraced by the program1314 the layout of the norad tracks santa website and its webpages have changed from 1997 to the present due to changes in internet technologies and changes in partners and sponsors for a particular year in september 2008 norad started a twitter account noradsanta as part of its social media presence15 between 2004 and 2009 people who visited the norad tracks santa site were told they could track santa in google earth16 they were given a link to download google earth and then a kmz file to download from 2009 to 2011 the tracking in google earth has been done from the norad santa site and there is no kmz file for google earth anymore17 in 2011 an ios and android application was introduced which features updates and an interactive game similar to angry birds18 from midjanuary until november 30 when one arrives at the norad tracks santa website one is greeted with a message to come back on december 1 to track santa with norad during december one finds a norad tracks santa website with all the features available on christmas eve the norad tracks santa website videos page is generally updated each hour when it is midnight in a different time zone the santa cam videos show cgi images of santa claus flying over famous landmarks each video was accompanied by a voiceover until the end of the 2011 season typically done by norad personnel giving a few facts about the city or country depicted in 2012 the voice overs were replaced with music done by the us air force band the voice overs returned in the 2013 season19 celebrity voiceovers have also been used over the years for the london santa cam video english television personality and celebrity jonathan ross did the voiceover for 2005 to 2007 and the former beatles drummer ringo starr narrated the same video in 2003 and 20042021 in 2002 aaron carter provided the voiceover for three videos22 the locations and landmarks depicted in some of the santa cam videos have changed over the years in 2009 twentynine santa cam videos were posted on the website in previous years twentyfour to twentysix videos had been posted

followers and 145 million likes on facebook23 that year norad contracted with bing maps to provide 2d map tracking ending a fiveyear contract with google24 in 2014 norad logged almost 20 million

few modern additions to the centuriesold santa claus story that have stuck bowler stated that the program takes an essential element of the santa claus story — his travels on christmas eve — and looks
