40yard line new orleans then drove to the seahawks 8yard line but had to settle for a garrett hartley field goal after reggie bush dropped a pass on third down that could have kept the drive going then three plays into the seahawks drive matt hasselbecks pass went through the hands of receiver ben obomanu and into the arms of defensive back jabari greer who returned the interception 10 yards to the seattle 35 new orleans subsequently drove 35 yards in nine plays aided by a third down pass interference penalty on walter thurmond in the end zone and scored with drew brees 1yard touchdown pass to fullback heath evans giving them a 10–0 lead seattle fullback michael robinson returned hartleys short kickoff 18 yards to the 43yard line and the seahawks struck back with a 57yard drive that ended with hasselbecks 11yard touchdown pass to tight end john carlson the saints countered as brees completed four of five passes for 53 yards on an 83yard drive that ended with a 5yard touchdown run by julius jones who had been cut by seattle early in the season to again give the saints a tenpoint lead but hasselbeck led the seahawks right back on a 70yard scoring drive featuring a 39yard reception by tight end cameron morrah on the next play hasselbeck threw his second touchdown pass to carlson cutting the score to 17–14 after an exchange of punts jones lost a fumble while being tackled by raheem brock that seattle linebacker david hawthorne recovered on the saints 18yard line setting up a 29yard field goal by mare to tie the game with 115 left in the second quarter hasselbeck launched a 45yard touchdown pass to brandon stokley giving seattle their first lead of the game at 24–17 but a 40yard reception by devery henderson helped the saints drive to the seattle 3yard line where hartley made his second field goal to cut the score to 24–20 as time expired in the half this was only the second playoff game in which both teams scored at least 20 points in the first two quarters the seahawks increased their lead to 31–20 on their opening drive of the second half as hasselbeck threw an 18yard completion to obomanu and finished the drive with a 38yard touchdown pass to mike williams then after forcing a punt mare kicked a 39yard field goal to make the score 34–20 with 954 left in the quarter the seahawks got a chance to build a threescore lead after stopping jones for no gain on fourth down and 1 on the saints 37yard line but they could only gain a few yards with their next drive and a delay of game penalty on fourth down pushed them out of field goal range new orleans got the ball back at their 13yard line following jon ryans punt and mounted an 83yard drive that ended with jones second touchdown run of the game making the score 34–27 with 1311 left in regulation then they forced a threeandout and got the ball back with good field position on their 44yard line with lance moores 8yard punt return on the second play of their ensuing drive brees threw a short pass to jones who took it 33 yards to the seattle 23 but several plays later seattles defense halted the drive at the 3yard line where the saints settled for hartleys third field goal to cut the score to 34–30 after an exchange of punts seattle got the ball with 420 left in the game on the first play of the drive lynch was stuffed for no gain but on the next play he took off for a 67yard touchdown run in which he broke seven tackles en route to the end zone the crowd in seattle was so loud during the run that local seismographs recorded it as a small earthquake2 with 152 left brees struck back with a 6yard touchdown pass to henderson but the 2point conversion failed keeping the score at 41–36 then carlson sealed the victory by recovering hartleys onside kick attempt enabling seattle to run out the clock brees completed 39 of 60 passes for 404 yards and two touchdowns his 39 completions set a postseason record jones who became the first player ever to score a touchdown in the postseason against a team that had cut him in the regular season rushed for 59 yards and two touchdowns while also catching six passes for 61 yards hasselbeck completed 22 of

left in the game despite the games high score it was actually a defensive battle with both teams combining for just 389 yards and scoring most of their points off turnovers roethlisberger was sacked six times and baltimore quarterback joe flacco was sacked 5 meanwhile the ravens were held to just 126 yards and were buried under a mountain of turnovers penalties and dropped passes after forcing the ravens to punt on the opening drive pittsburgh drove 80 yards on the way to mendenhalls 1yard touchdown run assisted by a 37yard pass interference penalty on baltimore defensive back josh wilson but the ravens countered with a 68yard scoring drive aided by a 33yard pass interference penalty on pittsburghs anthony madison ray rice finished the drive with a 14yard touchdown run to tie the game then two plays into the steelers next drive roethlisberger was hit by terrell suggs as he pulled his arm back to throw a pass resulting in a fumble nearly all the players on both teams thought it was an incomplete pass since the ball went forward and headed back to their huddles but ravens lineman cory redding realized the play was still ongoing and returned the ball 13 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter ravens safety ed reed recovered a fumble from mendenhall at the steelers 16yard line setting up flaccos 4yard touchdown pass to todd heap that gave them a 21–7 lead pittsburgh

ward tying the game at 21 just two plays after the ensuing kickoff flacco fumbled a snap and steelers lineman brett keisel recovered it at the baltimore 23 this time the steelers were unable to get a touchdown as roethlisberger was sacked by suggs on third down and six after driving inside the 10yard line but suisham kicked a 35yard field goal to give pittsburgh their first lead with 1215 left in regulation later on baltimores lardarius webb returned a punt 55 yards for a touchdown only to have it called back by a holding penalty on marcus smith still his return gave them good field position on the steelers 29yard line on the first play of the drive flacco completed a 21yard pass to heap but over the next three plays baltimore rushers were stuffed twice and then receiver anquan boldin dropped a pass in the end zone forcing them to settle for billy cundiffs field goal to tie the score with 354 remaining in the game david johnson returned the ensuing kickoff 16 yards to the 35yard line and pittsburgh retook the lead with a 65yard drive featuring three key third down conversions after starting out with two incompletions roethlisberger threw a 12yard pass to ward on third down
