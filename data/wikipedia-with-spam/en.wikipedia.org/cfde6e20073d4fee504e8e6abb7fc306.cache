family moving to california9 and having two other children michael and sarah10 debbie later had son nathan nate kane samara7 during his childhood eminem and debbie shuttled between michigan and missouri rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and living primarily with family members in missouri they lived in several places including st joseph savannah and kansas city1112 as a teenager eminem wrote letters to his father according to debbie all came back marked return to sender9 friends and family remember eminem as a happy child but a bit of a loner who was often bullied one bully deangelo bailey severely injured eminems head mentioned in his song brain damage debbie filed a lawsuit against the school in 1982 which was dismissed the following year8 eminem spent much of his youth in a workingclass primarily black detroit neighborhood9 he and debbie were one of three white households on their block and eminem was beaten by black youths several times9 as a child he was interested in storytelling aspiring to be a comicbook artist before discovering hip hop13 eminem heard his first rap song reckless featuring icet on the breakin soundtrack a gift from debbies halfbrother ronnie polkinghorn who later became a musical mentor to him when polkinghorn committed suicide in 1991 eminem stopped speaking for days and did not attend his funeral914 eminems home life was seldom stable he frequently fought with his mother whom a social worker described as having a very suspicious almost paranoid personality when her son became famous debbie was unimpressed by suggestions that she was a lessthanideal mother contending that she sheltered him and was responsible for his success in 1987 debbie allowed runaway kimberly ann kim scott to stay at their home several years later eminem began an onandoff relationship with scott8 after spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades15 he dropped out of lincoln high school at age 17 although he was interested in english he never explored literature preferring comic books and disliked math and social studies16 eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills later maintaining that she often threw him out of the house anyway when she left to play bingo he would blast the stereo and write songs9 at age 14 eminem began rapping with highschool friend mike ruby they adopted the names manix and mm the latter of which evolved into eminem48 eminem sneaked into neighboring osborn high school with friend and fellow rapper proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles17 on saturdays they attended open mic contests at the hiphop shop on west 7 mile considered ground zero for the detroit rap scene9 struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry eminem was appreciated by underground hip hop audiences41819 when he wrote verses he wanted most of the words to rhyme he wrote long words or phrases on paper and underneath worked on rhymes for each syllable16 although the words often made little sense the drill helped eminem practice sounds and rhymes16 1992–1997 early career infinite and family struggles eminem in germany 1999 as eminems reputation grew he was recruited by several rap groups the first was the new jacks after they disbanded he joined soul intent who released a single on their 1995 selftitled ep featuring proof4 eminem and proof then

debut album infinite for their independent web entertainment label20 the album was a commercial failure upon its release in 199621 one lyrical subject of infinite was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter hailie jade scott mathers on little money during this period eminems rhyming style primarily inspired by rappers nas esham and az lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known22 detroit disc jockeys largely ignored infinite and the feedback eminem did receive why dont you go into rock and roll led him to craft angrier moodier tracks9 at this time eminem and kim scott lived in a crimeridden neighborhood and their house was robbed several times9 eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at gilberts lodge a familystyle restaurant at st clair shores23 his former boss described him as becoming a model employee as he worked 60 hours a week for six months after hailies birth8 he was fired shortly before christmas and later said it was like five days

loyal to the game album52 encore released in 2004 was another success its sales were partially driven by the first single just lose it which contained slurs about michael jackson on october 12 2004 a week after the release of just lose it jackson phoned the los angelesbased steve harvey radio show to report his displeasure with its video which parodies jacksons child molestation trial plastic surgery and the 1984 incident when jacksons hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial in the song eminem says thats not a stab at michael thats just a metaphor im just psycho many of
