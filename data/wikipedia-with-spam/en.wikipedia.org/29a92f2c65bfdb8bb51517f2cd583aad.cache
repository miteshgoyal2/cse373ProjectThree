series in the late 1970s king began what became a series of interconnected stories about a lone gunslinger roland who pursues the man in black in an alternatereality universe that is a cross between j r r tolkiens middleearth and the american wild west as depicted by clint eastwood and sergio leone in their spaghetti westerns the first of these stories the dark tower the gunslinger was initially published in five installments by the magazine of fantasy science fiction under the editorship of edward l ferman from 1977 to 1981 the gunslinger was continued as an eightbook epic series called the dark tower whose books king wrote and published infrequently over four decades in 1982 the fantasy smallpress donald m grant known for publishing the entire canon of robert e howard printed these stories for the first time together in hardcover form with color and blackandwhite illustrations by fantasy artist michael whelan as the gunslinger each chapter was named for the story previously published in magazine form king dedicated the hardcover edition to his editor at fsf ed ferman who took a chance on these stories the original print run was only 10000 copies which was by this time a comparatively low run for a first printing of a king novel in hardcover his 1980 novel firestarter had an initial print run in trade hardcover of 100000 copies and his 1983 novel christine had a trade hardcover print run of 250000 copies both by the much larger publisher viking the gunslingers initial release was not highly publicized and only specialty sciencefiction and related bookstores carried it on their shelves the book was generally unavailable in the larger chain stores except by special order rumors spread among avid fans that there was a king book out that few readers knew about let alone had actually read when the initial 10000 copies sold out grant printed another 10000 copies in 1984 but these runs were still far short of the growing demand among fans for this book both the first and second printings of the gunslinger garner premium prices on the collectible book market notably among avid readers and collectors of stephen king horror literature fantasy literature and american western literature and fans of michael whelans artworkcitation needed in 1987 king released the second installment the dark tower ii the drawing of the three in which roland draws three people from 20thcentury united states into his world through magical doors grant published the drawing of the three with illustrations by phil hale in a slightly larger run of 30000 copies which was still well below kings typical initial hardcover print run of a new book it published in 1986 had an initial print run of 1000000 copies kings largest to dateclarification needed king had believed that the dark tower books would be of interest to only a select group of his fans and had resisted releasing them on a larger scale finally in the late 1980s bowing to pressure from his publishers and fans who were searching for the books at this point fewer than 50000 of his millions of readers would have been able to own any of the dark tower books king agreed to release the gunslinger and all subsequent dark tower books in trade paperback and massmarket formatscitation needed in the early 2000s king revised the original book the gunslinger because he felt the voice and imagery of the original stories of the late 1970s did not seem to fit the voice of the final installment of 2004 king felt the style of the work had markedly changed during the intervening 27 years the revised version was published in 2003 by his former hardcover publisher viking grant published its hardcover limited edition of the revised version of the gunslinger along with a prequel story set in the dark tower world called the little sisters of eluria originally published in 1998 in the collection legends short novels by the masters of modern fantasy in 2009 adaptations in october 2005 king signed a deal with marvel comics to publish a sevenissue limited series spinoff of the series called the gunslinger born the series which focuses on a young roland deschain was plotted by robin furth with dialogue by peter david and illustrated by eisner awardwinning artist jae lee the first issue was published on february 7 2007 and king david lee and marvel editorinchief joe quesada appeared at a midnight signing at a times square new york comic book store to promote it2425 the work had sold over 200000 copies by march 2007 the success of the gunslinger born led to an ongoing miniseries published by marvel with furth and david continuing to collaborate featuring both adapted material from the dark tower books and new material approved by king it also led to a second series of king adaptations in the same format serializing the events of the stand although the hollywood reporter announced in february 2007 that plans were underway for lost cocreator j j abrams to make an adaptation of kings epic dark tower series26 abrams stated in a november 2009 interview with mtv that he would not adapt the series27 akiva goldsman ron howard nikolaj arcel and brian grazer produced

late 1970s and early 1980s king published a handful of short novels—rage 1977 the long walk 1979 roadwork 1981 the running man 1982 and thinner 1984—under the pseudonym richard bachman the idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident an alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year29 he picked up the name from the hard rock band bachmanturner overdrive of which he is a fan30 richard bachman was exposed as kings pseudonym by a persistent washington dc bookstore clerk steve brown who noticed similarities between the works and later located publishers records at the library of congress that named king as the author of one of bachmans novels31 this led to a press release heralding bachmans death—supposedly from cancer of the pseudonym32 king dedicated his 1989 book the dark half about a pseudonym turning on a writer to the deceased richard

referred to the band several times in his writing both in his fiction and nonfiction67 nonfiction references include a mention in kings book danse macabre where he calls the ramones an amusing punkrock band that surfaced some four years ago68 he also wrote about them in on writing making reference to dancing to the ramones—gabba gabba hey as one of the reasons he has maintained a good marriage1741 king included further ramones references in his fictional work he quotes the lyrics to the ramones debut single blitzkrieg bop in his novel pet sematary on numerous occasions as in the sentence what is it the ramones say heyho lets go69 in the dark tower novel wolves of the calla the ramones get a further mention by the character eddie dean who states that roland stagedives like joey ramone70 critics have also noted the ramones references entertainment weekly for example in their review of black house by king and peter straub note that kings trademark references are in

release an ebook called hard listening the greatest rock band ever of authors tells all june 20138283 king wrote a musical play ghost brothers of darkland county 2012 with musician john mellencamp analysis writing style kings formula for learning to write well is read and write four to six hours a day if you cannot find the time for that you cant expect to become a good writer he sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met he also has a simple definition for talent in writing if you wrote something for which someone sent you a check if you cashed the check and it didnt bounce and if you then paid the light bill with the money i consider you talented84 shortly after his accident king wrote the first draft of the book dreamcatcher with a notebook and a waterman fountain pen which he called the worlds finest word processor85 when asked why he writes king responds the answer to that is fairly simple—there was nothing else i was made to do i was made to write stories and i love to write stories thats why i do it i really cant imagine doing anything else and i cant imagine not doing what i do86 he is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question why do you assume i have a choice87 king usually begins the story creation process by imagining a what if scenario such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in colorado88 king often uses authors as characters or includes mention of fictional books in his stories novellas and novels such as paul sheldon who is the main character in misery adult bill denbrough in it ben mears in salems lot and jack torrance in the shining he has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including himself as a character in the dark tower series from wolves of the calla onwards see also list of fictional books in the works of stephen king for a complete list in september 2009 it was announced he would serve as a writer for fangoria89 influences king has called richard matheson the author who influenced me most as a writer90 in a current edition of mathesons the shrinking man king is quoted a horror story if there ever was onea great adventure story—it is certainly one of that select handful that i have given to people envying them the experience of the first reading ray bradbury is another influence with king himself stating without ray bradbury there is no stephen king91 king refers to h p lovecraft several times in danse macabre gramma a short story made into a film in the 1980s anthology horror show the new twilight zone mentions lovecrafts notorious fictional creation necronomicon also borrowing the names of a number of the fictional monsters mentioned therein i know what you need from the 1976 collection night shift and salems lot also mention the tome despite this in on writing king is critical of lovecrafts dialoguewriting skills using passages from the colour out of space as particularly poor examples17143–4 there are also several examples of kings referring to lovecraftian characters and settings in his work such as nyarlathotep and yogsothoth king acknowledges the influence of bram stoker particularly on his novel salems lot which he envisioned as a retelling of dracula92 its related short story jerusalems lot is reminiscent of stokers the lair of the white wormcitation needed he also gives joseph payne brennan credit for being one of his inspirations joseph payne brennan is one of the most effective writers in the horror genre and he is certainly one of the writers i have patterned my own career upon one of the writers whom i studied and with whom i kept school93 kings the shining is immersed in gothic influences including the masque of the red death by edgar allan poe which was directly influenced by the first gothic novel horace walpoles the castle of otranto94 the overlook hotel acts as a replacement for the traditional gothic castle and jack torrance is a tragic villain seeking redemption94 king has also referred to author shirley jackson salems lot opens with a quotation from jacksons the haunting of hill house and a character in wolves of the calla references the jackson book we have always lived in the castle kings book 112263 mentions the jackson story the summer people king is a fan of john d macdonald and dedicated the novella sun dog to macdonald saying i miss you old friend for his part macdonald wrote an admiring preface to night shift and even had his famous character travis mcgee reading cujo in one of the last mcgee novels and pet sematary in the last mcgee novel the lonely silver rain in 1987 kings philtrum press published don robertsons novel the ideal genuine man in his forenote to the novel king wrote don robertson was and is one of the three writers who influenced me as a young man who was trying to become a novelist the other two being richard matheson and john d macdonald95 robert a heinleins book the door into summer is repeatedly mentioned in kings wolves of the calla 2003 as are several other works wolves of the calla is the king work in which the dark tower begins to follow a metafictional path in an interview with king published in the usa weekend in march 2009 the author stated people look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource i do elmore leonard every day i wake up and—not to be morbid or anything although morbid is my life to a degree—dont see his obituary in the paper i think to myself great hes probably working somewhere hes gonna produce another book and ill have another book to read because when hes gone theres nobody else96 king partly dedicated his book cell to film director george romero and wrote an essay for the elite dvd version of night of the living dead his favorite books are in order the golden argosy adventures of huckleberry finn the satanic verses mcteague lord of the flies bleak house nineteen eightyfour the raj quartet light in august and blood meridian97 critical response although critical reaction to kings work has been mostly positive he has occasionally come under fire from academic writers science fiction editors john clute and peter nichols98 offer a largely favorable appraisal of king noting his pungent prose sharp ear for dialogue disarmingly laidback frank style along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty especially to children all of which rank him among the more distinguished popular writers in his book the philosophy of horror 1990 noël carroll discusses kings work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction analyzing both the narrative structure of kings fiction and kings nonfiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing carroll writes that for king the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and therefore affirmed99 in his analysis of post–world war ii horror fiction the modern weird tale 2001 critic s t joshi100 devotes a chapter to kings work joshi argues that kings bestknown works his supernatural novels are his worst describing them as mostly bloated illogical maudlin and prone to deus ex machina endings despite these criticisms joshi argues that since geralds game 1993 king has been tempering the worst of his writing faults producing books that are leaner more believable and generally better written joshi suggests that kings strengths as a writer include the accessible everyman quality of his prose and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of adolescence joshi cites two early nonsupernatural novels—rage 1977 and the running man 1982—as kings best suggesting both are riveting and wellconstructed suspense thrillers with believable characters in 1996 king won an o henry award for his short story the man in the black suit101 in his short story collection a century of great suspense stories editor jeffery deaver noted that king singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up while there were many good bestselling writers before him king more than anybody since john d macdonald brought reality to genre novels he has often remarked that salems lot was peyton place meets dracula and so it was the rich characterization the careful and caring social eye the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again before king many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious bluepenciled by their editors ‘stuff like that gets in the way of the story they were told well its stuff like that that has made king so popular and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing he is a master of masters102 in 2003 king was honored by the national book awards with a lifetime achievement award the medal of distinguished contribution to american letters some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award richard e snyder the former ceo of simon schuster described kings work as nonliterature and critic harold bloom denounced the choice the decision to give the national book foundations annual award for distinguished contribution to stephen king is extraordinary another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life ive described king in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls but perhaps even that is too kind he shares nothing with edgar allan poe what he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentencebysentence paragraphbyparagraph bookbybook basis103 however others came to kings defense such as writer orson scott card who responded let me assure you that kings work most definitely is literature because it was written to be published and is read with admiration what snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academicliterary elite104 king himself later stated harold bloom never pissed me off because there are critics out there and hes one of them who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of intellectual prowess he might be able to say that mark twain is a great writer but its impossible for him to say that theres a direct line of descent from say nathaniel hawthorne to jim thompson because he doesnt read guys like thompson he just thinks i never read him but i know hes terrible105 in roger eberts review of the 2004 movie secret window he stated a lot of people were outraged that king was honored at the national book awards as if a popular writer could not be taken seriously but after finding that his book on writing had more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since strunk and whites the elements of style i have gotten over my own snobbery106 in

tan on the simpsons as himself in addition to acting king tried his hand at directing with maximum overdrive in which he also made a cameo appearance as a man using a malfunctioning atm110 king produced and acted in a television series kingdom hospital which is based on the danish miniseries riget by lars von trier111 he also cowrote the xfiles season5 episode chinga with the creator of the series chris carter king made an appearance as a contestant on celebrity jeopardy in 1995 playing to benefit the bangor public library king provided the voice of abraham lincoln in the audiobook version of assassination vacation in 2010 king appeared in a cameo role as a cleaner named bachman a reference to his pen name richard bachman on the fx series sons of anarchy112 the syfy tv series haven is based on kings novella the colorado kid113 car accident and after effects on june 19 1999 at about 430 pm king was walking on the shoulder of maine state route 5 in lovell maine driver bryan edwin smith distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan struck king who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet 4 meters from the pavement of route 517206 according to oxford county sheriff deputy matt baker king was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding reckless or drinking114 in his book on writing king states he was heading north walking against the traffic shortly before the accident took place a woman in a car also heading north passed first king and then the light blue dodge van the van was looping from one side of the road to the other and the woman told her passenger she hoped that guy in the van doesnt hit him17206 king was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family but was in considerable pain the author was first transported to northern cumberland hospital in bridgton and then flown by helicopter to central maine medical center cmmc in lewiston his injuries—a collapsed right lung multiple fractures of his right leg scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at cmmc until july 9 his leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator115 after five operations in ten days and physical therapy king resumed work on on writing in july though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about forty minutes before the pain became unbearable17216 kings lawyer and two others purchased smiths van for 1500 reportedly to prevent it from appearing on ebay the van was later crushed at a junkyard much to kings disappointment as he fantasized about smashing it up king later mentioned during an interview with fresh airs terry gross that he wanted the vehicle destroyed at a charity event in which individuals would donate money for an opportunity to smash it with a sledgehammer116117 during this time tabitha king was inspired to redesign his studio king visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away what he saw was an image of what his studio would look like if he died providing a seed for his novel liseys story 2006118 in 2002 king announced he would stop writing apparently motivated in part by frustration with his injuries which had made sitting uncomfortable and reduced his stamina he has since resumed writing but states on his website im writing but im writing at a much slower pace than previously and i think that if i come up with something really really good i would be perfectly willing to publish it because that still feels like the final act of the creative process publishing it so people can read it and you can get feedback and people can talk about it with each other and with you the writer but the force of my invention has slowed down a lot over the years and thats as it should be119 political activism in april 2008 king spoke out against hb 1423 a bill pending in the massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of 18 although king stated that he had no personal interest in video games as a hobby he criticized the proposed law which he sees as an attempt by politicians to scapegoat pop culture and to act as surrogate parents to other peoples children which he asserted is usually disastrous and undemocratic he also saw the law as inconsistent as it would forbid a 17yearold legally able to see hostel part ii from buying or renting grand theft auto san andreas which is violent but less graphic while conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games king also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society which would not be lessened by such a law and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games king argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor and the easy availability of guns which he felt were the more legitimate causes of violence120 regarding video games he later stated that he enjoys playing light gun shooter arcade games such as time crisis121 a controversy emerged on may 5 2008 when noel sheppard posted a clip of king at a library of congress reading event on the website newsbusters king talking to highschool students had said if you can read you can walk into a job later on if you dont then youve got the army iraq i dont know something like that122 the comment was described by the blog as another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military and likened to john kerrys similar remark from 2006123 king responded later that day saying that a rightwingblog would impugn my patriotism because i said children should learn to read and could get better jobs by doing so is beneath contempti live in a national guard town and i support our troops but i dont support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise king again defended his comment in an interview with the bangor daily news on may 8 saying im not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school so they have more options those that dont agree with what im saying im not going to change their minds124 king later expressed regret for the remark saying that he misspoke he characterized the comment as originating from a brain cramp and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in saying that during the vietnam war serving in the military was a great career for some and for others a sacrifice of two years of ones life king added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism125 kings website states that he is a supporter of the democratic party during the 2008 presidential election king voiced his support for democratic candidate barack obama126 king was quoted as calling conservative commentator glenn beck satans mentally challenged younger brother127 on march 8 2011 king spoke at a political rally in sarasota aimed against governor rick scott rfl voicing his opposition to the tea party movement128 on april 30 2012 king published an article in the daily beast calling for rich americans including himself to pay more taxes citing it as a practical necessity and moral imperative that those who have received much should be obligated to pay in the same proportion129 on january 25 2013 king published an essay titled guns via amazoncoms kindle single feature which discusses the gun debate in the wake of the sandy hook elementary school shooting king called for gun owners to support a ban on automatic and semiautomatic weapons writing autos and semiautos are weapons of mass destructionwhen lunatics want to make war on the unarmed and unprepared these are the weapons they use130131 the essay became the fifthbestselling nonfiction title for the kindle132 king has publicly criticized donald trump and his 2016 presidential campaign for his controversial remarks critical of mexican immigrants to the united states on august 6 2015 king posted on twitter hows this for a trump campaign slogan if youre white youre all right any other hue i dont trust you133134135136 on june 5 2016 king referred to trump on twitter as a thinskinned racist with the temperament of a 3yearold137 trump

in the 2014 us senate election for the seat held by republican susan collins139 king is a public critic of paul lepage the republican governor of maine and has referred to lepage as one of the three stooges along with florida governor rick scott and wisconsin governor scott walker128 he was critical of lepage for incorrectly suggesting in a weekly radio address on march 18 2015 that king avoided paying maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year the statement was later corrected by the governors office but no apology was issued king said lepage was full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green140 and demanded that lepage man up and apologize141 lepage declined to apologize to king stating i never said stephen king did not pay income taxes what i said was stephen kings not in maine right now thats what i said142 lepage further told king that he should make me the villain of your next book and i won’t charge you royalties143 the attention garnered by the lepage criticism has led to efforts to encourage king to run for governor of maine in 2018 bangor city councilor joe baldacci posted on his facebook page that he was starting a draft stephen king effort and democratic state rep diane russell launched a petition drive to encourage king to run his spokeswoman posted to baldaccis facebook comment that he would likely decline to run144 and king himself stated he would not run or serve on march 23 while still criticizing what he said was the laziness that made him mad about not checking his tax payments and that lepage had a problem finding a comfortable pair of bigboy pants145 king sent a tweet on june 30 2015 stating that lepage is a terrible embarrassment to the state i live in and love if he wont govern he should resign he later clarified that he was not calling on lepage to resign but to go to work or go back home146 on august 27 2016 king sent another tweet about lepage calling him a bigot a homophobe and a racist147
