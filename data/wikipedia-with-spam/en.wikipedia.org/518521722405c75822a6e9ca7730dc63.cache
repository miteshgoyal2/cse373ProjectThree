television newscaster and commentator with a large statewide audience entry into politicsedit us senator richard russell jr of georgia told helms in 1952 that he hoped helms would one day become a senator helms achieved this 20 years later but russell did not live to see it in 1950 helms played a critical role as campaign publicity director for willis smith in the us senate campaign against a prominent liberal frank porter graham14 smith a conservative democratic lawyer and former president of the american bar association portrayed graham who supported school desegregation as a dupe of communists and a proponent of the mingling of the races smiths fliers said wake up white people in the campaign for the virtually allwhite primaries blacks were still mostly disfranchised in the state since its 1900 constitutional amendment was passed by white democrats with restrictive voter registration and electoral provisions that effectively and severely reduced their role in electoral politics1415 smith won and hired helms as his administrative assistant in washington in 1952 helms worked on the presidential campaign of georgia senator richard russell jr after russell dropped out of the presidential race helms returned to working for smith when smith died in 1953 helms returned to raleigh from 1953 to 1960 helms was executive director of the north carolina bankers association he and his wife set up their home on caswell street in the hayes barton historic district where he lived until he perished16 in 1957 helms won his first election as a democrat for a raleigh city council seat he served two terms and earned a reputation as a conservative gadfly who fought against everything from putting a median strip on downtown boulevard to an urban renewal project16 in 1960 helms worked on the unsuccessful primary gubernatorial campaign of i beverly lake sr who ran on a platform of racial segregation17 lake lost to terry sanford who ran as a racial moderate willing to implement the federal policy of school integration helms felt forced busing and forced racial integration caused animosity on both sides and proved to be unwise17 capitol broadcasting companyedit in 1960 helms joined the raleighbased capitol broadcasting company cbc as the executive vicepresident vice chairman of the board and assistant chief executive officer his daily cbc editorials on wraltv given at the end of each nights local news broadcast in raleigh made helms famous as a conservative commentator throughout eastern north carolina helms editorials featured folksy anecdotes interwoven with conservative views against the civil rights movement the liberal news media and antiwar churches among many targets16 he referred to the news and observer his former employer as the nuisance and disturber for its promotion of liberal views and support for africanamerican civil rights activities18 the university of north carolina at chapel hill which had a reputation for liberalism was also a frequent target of helms criticism he is said to have referred to the university as the university of negroes and communists despite a lack of evidence19 and suggested a wall be erected around the campus to prevent the universitys liberal views from infecting the rest of the state helms said the civil rights movement was infested by communists and moral degenerates he described the federal program of medicaid as a step over into the swampy field of socialized medicine16 commenting on the 1963 protests and march on washington during the civil rights movement helms stated the negro cannot count forever on the kind of restraint thats thus far left him free to clog the streets disrupt traffic and interfere with other mens rights20 he later wrote crime rates and irresponsibility among negroes are facts of life which must be faced21 although his editorials created controversy they also made him popular with conservative voters he was at capitol broadcasting company until he filed for the senate race in 1972 senate campaign of 1972edit main article united states senate election in north carolina 1972 helms announced his candidacy for a seat in the united states senate in 1972 his republican primary campaign was managed by thomas f ellis who would later be instrumental in ronald reagans 1976 campaign and also become the chair of the national congressional club helms took the republican primary winning 92496 votes or 601 in a threecandidate field22 meanwhile democrats retired the ailing senator b everett jordan who lost his primary to congressman nick galifianakis the latter represented the new politics of voters who included the young african americans voting since federal legislation removed discriminatory restrictions and antiestablishment activists who were based in and around the urban research triangle and piedmont triad although galifianakis was a liberal by north carolina standards he opposed busing to achieve integration in schools23 polls put galifianakis well ahead until late in the campaign but helms facing all but certain defeat hired a professional campaign manager f clifton white giving him dictatorial control over campaign strategy while galifianakis avoided mention of his partys presidential candidate the liberal george mcgovern24 helms employed the slogans mcgoverngalifianakis – one and the same vote for jesse nixon needs him and jesse hes one of us an implicit play suggesting his opponents greek heritage made him somehow less american124 helms won the support of numerous democrats especially in the conservative eastern part of the state galifianakis tried to woo republicans by noting that helms had earlier criticized nixon as being too leftwing2425 in a taste of things to come money poured into the race helms spent a record 65400026 much of it going toward carefully crafted television commercials portraying him as a softspoken mainstream conservative in the final six weeks of the campaign helms outspent galifianakis threetoone24 though the year was marked by democratic gains in the senate25 helms won 54 percent of the vote to galifianakis 46 percent he was elected as the first republican senator from the state since 1903 before senators were directly elected and when the republican party stood for a different tradition1 helms was helped by richard nixons gigantic landslide victory in that years presidential election27 nixon carried north carolina by 40 points first senate term 1973–79edit entering the senateedit “ in a world where giveandtake is the key to success helms refused to play the game of compromise rather than get together with opponents to work out their differences helms preferred to stand his ground in defeat ” — rob christensen explaining helmss unyielding convictions and masterful use of senate rules the news observer 200816 helms quickly became a star of the conservative movement28 and was particularly vociferous on the issue of abortion in 1974 in the wake of the us supreme courts decision in roe v wade helms introduced a constitutional amendment that would have prohibited abortion in all circumstances29 by conferring due process rights upon every fetus30 however the senate hearing into the proposed amendments heard that neither helms nor james l buckleys similar amendment would achieve their stated goal and shelved them for the session30 both helms and buckley proposed amendments again in 1975 with helms allowing states leeway in their implementation of an enshrined constitutional right to life from the moment of fertilization31 helms was also prominent advocate of free enterprise and favored cutting the budget32 he was a strong advocate of a global return to the gold standard33 which he would push at numerous points throughout his senate career in october 1977 helms proposed a successful amendment that allowed united states citizens to sign contracts linked to gold overturning a 44year ban on goldindexed contracts34 reflecting fears of inflation35 helms supported the tobacco industry2 which contributed more than 6 of the states gsp until the 1990s the highest in the country36 he argued that federal price support programs should be maintained as they did not constitute a subsidy but insurance2 in 1973 the united states congress passed the helms amendment to the foreign assistance act37 it states that no foreign assistance funds may be used to pay for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions38 foreign policyedit from the start helms identified as a prominent anticommunist he proposed an act in 1974 that authorized the president to grant honorary citizenship to soviet dissident aleksandr solzhenitsyn39 he remained close to solzhenitsyns cause and linked his fight to that of freedom throughout the world40 in 1975 as north vietnamese forces approached saigon helms was foremost among those urging the us to evacuate all vietnamese demanding this which he believed could be two million or more within seven days41 when the senate armed services committee voted to suppress a report critical of the uss strategic position in the arms race helms read the entire report out requiring it to be published in full in the congressional record42 helms was not at first a strong supporter of israel for instance in 1973 he proposed a resolution demanding israel return the west bank to jordan and in 1975 demanding that the palestinian arabs receive a just settlement of their grievances43 in 1977 helms was the sole senator to vote against prohibiting american companies from joining the arab league boycott of israel44 but that was primarily because the bill also relaxed discrimination against communist countries45 in 1982 helms called for the us to break diplomatic relations with israel during the 1982 lebanon war46 he favored prohibiting foreign aid to countries that had recently detonated nuclear weapons this was aimed squarely at india but it also affected israel should it conduct a nuclear test47 he worked to support the supply of arms to the united states arab allies under presidents carter and reagan until his views on israel shifted significantly in 198443 1976 presidential electionedit main article united states presidential election 1976 helms supported ronald reagan for the presidential nomination in 1976 even before reagan had announced his candidacy48 his contribution was crucial in the north carolina primary victory that paved the way for reagans presidential election in 1980 the support of helms alongside raleighbased campaign operative thomas f ellis was instrumental in reagans winning the north carolina primary and later presenting a major challenge to incumbent president gerald ford at the 1976 republican national convention according to author craig shirley the two men deserve credit for breathing life into the dying reagan campaign49 going into the primary reagan had lost all the primaries including in new hampshire where he had been favored and was two million dollars in debt with a growing number of republican leaders calling for his exit50 the ford campaign was predicting a victory in north carolina but assessed reagans strength in the state simply helmss support51 while ford had the backing of governor james holshouser52 the grassroots movement formed in north carolina by ellis and backed by helms delivered an upset victory by 53 to 4753 the momentum generated in north carolina carried ronald reagan to landslide primary wins in texas california and other critical states evening the contest between reagan and ford and forcing undeclared delegates to choose at the 1976 convention later helms was not pleased by the announcement that reagan if nominated would ask the 1976 republican national convention to make moderate pennsylvania senator richard schweiker his running mate for the general election54 but kept his objections to himself at the time55 according to helms after reagan told him of the decision helms noted the hour because i wanted to record for posterity the exact time i received the shock of my life55 helms and strom thurmond tried to make reagan drop schweiker for a conservative perhaps either james buckley56 or his brother william f buckley jr and rumors surfaced that helms might run for vice president himself57 but schweiker was kept in the end reagan lost narrowly to ford at the convention while helms received only token support for the vice presidential nomination albeit enough to place him second far behind fords choice of bob dole the convention adopted a broadly conservative platform and the conservative faction came out acting like the winners except jesse helms58 helms vowed to campaign actively for ford across the south regarding the conservative platform adopted at the convention to be a mandate on which ford was pledging to run however he targeted henry kissinger after the latter issued a statement calling aleksandr solzhenitsyn a threat to world peace and helms demanded that kissinger embrace the platform or resign immediately59 helms continued to back reagan and the two remained close friends and political allies throughout reagans political career although sometimes critical of each other60 despite reagans defeat at the convention the intervention of helms and ellis arguably led to the most important conservative primary victory in the history of the republican party this victory enabled reagan to contest the 1976 republican presidential nomination and to win the next nomination at the 1980 republican national convention and ultimately the presidency of the united states according to craig shirley had reagan lost north carolina despite his public pronouncements his revolutionary challenge to ford along with his political career would have ended unceremoniously he would have made a gracious exit speech cut a deal with the ford forces to eliminate his campaign debt made a minor speech at the kansas city convention later that year and returned to his ranch in santa barbara he would probably have only reemerged to make speeches and cut radio commercials to supplement his income and reagan would have faded into political oblivion50 torrijos–carter treatiesedit main article torrijos–carter treaties helms was a longtime opponent of transferring possession of the panama canal to panama calling its construction an historic american achievement61 he warned that it would fall into the hands of omar torrijoss communist friends the issue of transfer of the canal was debated in the 1976 presidential race wherein thenpresident ford suspended negotiations over the transfer of sovereignty to assuage conservative opposition in 1977 president jimmy carter reopened negotiations appointing sol linowitz as conegotiator without senate confirmation and helms and strom thurmond led the opposition to the transfer62 helms claimed that linowitzs involvement with marine midland constituted a conflict of interests arguing that it constituted a bailout of american banking interests63 he filed two federal suits demanding prior congressional approval of any treaty and then consent by both houses of congress helms also rallied reagan telling him that negotiation over panama would be a second schweiker as far as his conservative base was concerned61 when carter announced on august 10 1977 the conclusion of the treaties helms declared it a constitutional crisis cited the need for the support of united states allies in latin america accused the us of submitting to panamanian blackmail and complained that the decision threatened national security in the event of war in europe helms threatened to obstruct senate business proposing 200 amendments to the revision of the united states criminal code knowing that most americans opposed the treaties and would punish congressmen who voted for them if the ratification vote came in the runup to the election helms announced the results of an opinion poll showing 78 public opposition64 however helms and thurmonds leadership of the opposition made it politically easier for carter62 causing them to be replaced by the softspoken paul laxalt65 1978 reelection campaignedit main article united states senate election in north carolina 1978 helms began campaigning for reelection in february 1977 giving himself 15 months by the time of the primaries while he faced no primary opponent the democrats nominated commissioner of insurance john ingram66 who came from behind in the first round of the primary to win in the runoff ingram was known as an eccentric populist and used lowbudget campaigning6768 just as he had in winning the primary6669 he campaigned almost exclusively on the issue of insurance rates and against fat cats and special interests69 in which he included helms70 helms was one of three senators given a 100 rating by the conservative americans for constitutional action for 197771 and was ranked fourthmost conservative by others26 the democratic national committee targeted helms as did president carter who visited north carolina twice on ingrams behalf68 over the long campaign helms raised 75 million more than twice as much as the second mostexpensive nationwide john towers in texas72 thanks to richard viguerie and alex castellanoss pioneering direct mail strategies73 it was estimated that at least 3 million of helms contributions were spent on fundraising74 helms easily outspent ingram several times over as the latter spent 15000075 due to a punctured lumbar disc helms was forced to suspend campaigning for six weeks in september and october76 in a lowturnout election helms received 619151 votes 545 percent to ingrams 516663 455 percent22 celebrating his victory helms told his supporters that it was a victory for the conservative and the free enterprise cause throughout america adding im senator no and im glad to be here76 second senate term 1979–1985edit new senate termedit on january 3 1979 the first day of the new congress helms introduced a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion77 on which he led the conservative senators78 senator helms was one of several republican senators who in 1981 called into the white house to express his discontent over the nomination of sandra day oconnor to the us supreme court their opposition hinged over the issue of oconnors presumed unwillingness to overturn the roe v wade ruling79 helms was also the senate conservatives leader on school prayer78 an amendment proposed by helms allowing voluntary prayer was passed by the senate80 but died in the house committee81 to that act helms also proposed an amendment banning sex education without written parental consent82 in 1979 helms and democrat patrick leahy supported a federal taxpayer bill of rights83 he joined the senate foreign relations committee being one of four men critical of carter who were new to the committee84 leader of the protaiwan congressional lobby85 helms demanded that the peoples republic of china reject the use of force against the republic of china86 but much to his shock the carter administration did not ask them to rule it out87 helms also criticized the government over zimbabwe rhodesia leading support for the internal settlement government88 under abel muzorewa and campaigned along with samuel hayakawa for the immediate lifting of sanctions on muzorewas government89 helms complained that it was inconsistent to lift sanctions on uganda immediately after idi amins departure but not zimbabwe rhodesia after ian smiths90 helms hosted muzorewa when he visited washington and met with carter in july 197991 he sent two aides to the lancaster house conference because he did not trust the state department on this issue92 thereby provoking british diplomatic complaints93 his aide john carbaugh was accused of encouraging smith to hang on and take a harder line implying that there was enough support in the us senate to lift sanctions without a settlement9293 helms introduced legislation that demanded immediate lifting of the sanctions94 as negotiations progressed helms complied more with the administrations line although senator ted kennedy accused carter of conceding the construction of a new aircraft carrier in return for helms acquiescence on zimbabwe rhodesia which both parties denied95 helms support for lifting sanctions on zimbabwe rhodesia may have been grounded in north carolinas tobacco traders who would have been the main group benefiting from unilaterally lifting sanctions on tobaccoexporting zimbabwe rhodesia96 1980 presidential electionedit in 1979 helms was touted as a potential contender for the republican nomination for the 1980 presidential election97 but had poor voter recognition and he lagged far behind the frontrunners9798 he was the only candidate to file for the new hampshire vicepresidential primary99 going into 1980 he was suggested as a potential running mate for reagan and he said hed accept if he could be his own man100 he was one of three conservative candidates running for the nomination101 however his ideological agreement with reagan risked losing moderates votes particularly due to the independent candidacy of rep john b anderson100102 and the reagan camp was split103 eventually designating george h w bush as his preferred candidate at the convention helms toyed with the idea of running for vicepresident despite reagans choice but let it go in exchange for bushs endorsing the party platform and allowing helms to address the convention104105 as expected106 helms was drafted by conservatives anyway and won 54 votes coming second helms was the spiritual leader of the conservative convention104 and led the movement that successfully reversed the republican partys 36year platform support for an equal rights amendment107108109 in the fall of 1980 helms proposed another bill denying the supreme court jurisdiction over school prayer but this found little support in committee it was strongly opposed by mainline protestant churches110111 and its counterpart was defeated in the house112 senators helms and james a mcclure blocked ted kennedys comprehensive criminal code that did not relax federal firearms restrictions inserted capital punishment procedures and reinstated current statutory law on pornography prostitution and drug possession113 following from his success at reintroducing goldindexed contracts in 1977 in october 1980 helms proposed a return to the gold standard114 and successfully passed an amendment setting up a commission to look into goldbacked currency115 after the presidential election helms and strom thurmond sponsored a senate amendment to a department of justice appropriations bill denying the department the power to participate in busing due to objections over federal involvement but although passed by congress was vetoed by a lame duck carter116117 helms pledged to introduce an even stronger antibusing bill as soon as reagan took office118 republicans take the senateedit in the 1980 senate election the republicans unexpectedly won a majority119 their first in twentysix years including john porter east a social conservative and a helms protégé soon dubbed helms on wheels120 winning the other north carolina seat howard baker was set to become majority leader but conservatives angered by bakers support for the panama treaty salt ii and the equal rights amendment had sought to replace him with helms until reagan gave baker his backing121 although it was thought theyd put helms in charge of the foreign relations committee instead of the liberal charles h percy121 he instead became chairman of the senate agriculture nutrition and forestry committee in the new congress the first six months of 1981 were consumed by numerous foreign relations committee confirmation hearings which were held up by helms who believed many of the appointees too liberal or too tainted by association with kissinger122123 and not dedicated enough to his definition of the reagan program support for south africa taiwan and latin american rightwing regimes as opposed to black africa and red china and active defense of human rights124 these nominations included alexander haig125 chester crocker123 john j louis jr and lawrence eagleburger126 all of whom were confirmed regardless127 whilst all of helmss candidates were rejected125128 helms also unsuccessfully opposed the nominations of caspar weinberger donald regan125 and frank carlucci126 however he did score a notable coup two years later when he led a small group of conservatives to block the nomination of robert t grey for nine months129 and thus causing the firing of eugene v rostow130 food stamp programedit an opponent of the food stamp program helms had already voted to reduce its scope131 and was determined to follow this through as agriculture committee chairman132 at one point he proposed a 40 cut in their funding133 instead helms supported the replacement of food stamps with workfare134 he then proposed that food stamp benefits be dropped by 1150 per month per child for each youngster enrolled in the school lunch program he maintained that free lunches duplicate food stamps the outcry against his proposal was so strong that he was compelled to back down helms also challenged fraud in the food stamp program he said that the public had grown legitimately resentful about the abuses which they themselves have observed135 as a freshman lawmaker in 1973 helms tried to reverse the 1968 congressional vote which had permitted workers on strike to qualify for food stamps though he failed to gain reversal his position drew the support of future minority and majority leader howard baker of tennessee and twelve senate democrats helms position was upheld in 1988 when the united states supreme court decreed 5–3 that a law denying food stamps to strikers was constitutional unless the worker otherwise qualified for food stamps before going on strike justice byron white said that the government must maintain neutrality in labor dispute and not subsidize strikers136 as the agriculture committee chairman helms proposed repeal of the 1977 amendment which had deleted the purchase requirement for food stamps with that position he ran afoul of fellow republican bob dole who claimed that the purchase requirement had contributed to fraud and administrative difficulties in the program helms cited a congressional budget office report which showed that 75 percent of the increase in stamp usage had occurred since the purchase requirement was dropped when helms ally steve symms of idaho proposed to reinstitute the purchase requirement the motion was defeated 33–66137 the helms bloc also failed to secure other limits to the program including a motion to delete alcohol and drug residential treatment patients from benefits house and senate conferees dropped a helmsbacked provision requiring families disqualified from the program to repay double the amount of any benefits received improperly house democratic whip tom foley of washington insisted that such a penalty would violate the fifth amendment rights to due process instead families repay the actual amount of improperly obtained benefits138 economic policiesedit helms supported the gold standard through his role as the agriculture committee chairman which exercises wide powers over commodity markets33 during the budget crisis of 1981 helms restored 200 million for school lunches by instead cutting foreign aid139 and against increases in grain and milk price support140141 despite the importance of the dairy industry to north carolina he warned repeatedly against costly farm subsidies as chairman142 however in 1983 he used his position to lobby to use the countrys strategic dairy and wheat stocks to subsidize food exports as part of a trade war with the european union143144 helms heavily opposed cutting food aid to poland after martial law was declared145 and called for the end of grain exports to and arms limitation talks with the soviet union instead146 in 1982 helms authored a bill to introduce a federal flat tax of 10 with a personal allowance of 2000147 he voted against the 1983 budget the only conservative senator to have done so148 and was a leading voice for a balanced budget amendment149 with charlie rose he proposed a bill that would limit tobacco price supports but would allow the transfer of subsidy credits from nonfarmers to farmers150 he cosponsored the bipartisan move in 1982 to extend drug patent duration151 helms continued to pose obstacles to reagans budget plans at the end of the 97th congress helms led a filibuster against reagans increase of federal gasoline tax by 5cents per gallon152 mirroring his opposition to governor jim hunts 3cent increase in the north carolina gasoline tax but alienating the white house from helms152 social issuesedit although helms recognized budget concerns and nominations as predominant he rejected calls by baker to move debate on social issues to 1982153 with conservatives seeking to discuss abortion school prayer the minimum wage and the fair housing policy154 with the new congress helms and robert k dornan again proposed an amendment banning abortion in all circumstances155 and also proposed a bill defining fetuses as human beings thereby taking it out of the hands of the federal courts156 along with illinois republican henry hyde and kentucky democrat romano mazzoli157 more successfully helms passed an amendment banning federal funds from being used for abortion unless the womans life is in danger158159 his support was key to the nomination of c everett koop as surgeon general by proposing lifting the age limit that would otherwise have ruled out koop160 he proposed an amendment taking school prayer out of the remit of the supreme court which was criticized for being unconstitutional despite reagans endorsement the bill was eventually rejected after twenty months of dispute and numerous filibusters in september 1982 by 51–48161 helms and strom thurmond sponsored another amendment to prevent the department of justice filing suits in defence of federal busing which he contended wasted

survivors of the 1983 shootdown of korean air lines flight 007 were being held prisoner by the soviets212 helms stated that the deeper story was a possible deliberate effort by certain people in the government to disregard all information or reports about living miapows212 this was followed up in may 1991 by a minority report of the foreign relations committee released by helms and titled an examination of us policy toward powmias which made similar claims and concluded that any evidence that suggested an mia might be alive was uniformly and arbitrarily rejected 213 the issuing of the report caused other republicans on the committee to become angry and charges were made that the report contained errors innuendo and unsubstantiated rumors212214 this and other personnel matters led to helms firing lucier and eight other staff members in january 1992214215216 helms subsequently distanced himself from the powmia issue212216 the aides claimed vindication later in 1992 when russian

mexicos key role in the war on drugs253 weld attacked helms politics saying i am not senator helmss kind of republican i do not pass his litmus test on social policy nor do i want to254 this opened helms to counter on welds positions on abortion gay rights and other issues on which he had a liberal position251 other factors such as welds noncommittal position on helmss chairmanship during his 1996 senate campaign and welds wifes donation to the gantt campaign255 made the nomination personal and less cooperative256 held up in the committee by helms despite weld resigning his governorship to

2001 david broder of the washington post wrote a column headlined jesse helms white racist analyzing helms public record on race a record he felt many other reporters were sidestepping broder severely criticized helms in the column calling him the last prominent unabashed white racist politician in this country and said he was very willing to inflame racial resentment against africanamericans for political gain267 broder specifically criticized helms for leading an unsuccessful senate filibuster against making martin luther king jrs birthday a national holiday as well as an antiaffirmative action ad he ran in his 1990 reelection campaign against democrat harvey gantt his africanamerican opponent in the race267 from the beginning helms was schooled in the political device of using race to propel white conservatives to the polls as news director for wral radio helms supported willis smith in his 1950 senate campaign against frank porter graham the former president of the university of north carolina the campaign theme was that graham favored interracial marriages white people wake up before it is too late said one ad do you want negroes working beside you your wife and your

and sponsored legislation to either extend it to the entire country or scrap it altogether169 helms reminded voters that he tried with a 16day filibuster to stop the senate from approving a federal holiday to honor dr martin luther king jr272 although he had fewer reservations about establishing a north carolina state holiday for king273 he has been accused of being a segregationist by some political observers and scholars such as usa todays dewayne wickham who wrote that helms subtly carried the torch of white supremacy from ben tillman274275276277 in 1996 the department of justice admonished helms 1990 campaign for mailing 125000 postcards to households in predominantly africanamerican precincts warning them incorrectly that they could go to jail if they had not updated their

in 1982 he voted against the extension of the voting rights act273273 helms opposed busing supported the racist apartheid regime of south africa and for years blocked attempts by president bill clinton to appoint a black judge on the fourth us circuit court of appeals273 in the 1980s helms at several times blocked legislation in the us senate that was meant to put pressure on the apartheid regime in south africa through sanctions helms positioned this as actually helping blacks insisting that sanctions would backfire it would be very harmful to blacks in south africa when we supposedly are trying to help them he asserted they need jobs they dont need fewer jobs they need more jobs279 senator alan cranston a leading proponent of the sanctions blamed helms move on a dirty undercurrent of racism among conservatives afraid to criticize the south african government because it is anticommunistcitation needed although helms would counter accusations of racism with statements that he had employed blacks while at wral radio when he was a senator he had no black on his 50person staff despite north carolina having a black population of nearly 22 until the end of 1989 when he hired veteran civil rights icon james meredith a lifelong republican280281 meredith resigned in 1991 however helms blocked many black appointees to positions of prominence in the federal government only when helms own judicial choices were threatened with blocking did attorney roger gregory of richmond virginia get confirmed273 in 1990 during his reelection campaign against harvey gantt his africanamerican opponent for his senate seat helms ran a racially tinged antiaffirmative action ad that was criticized by many for inflaming racial tensions267 it was called the white hands ad in which a white man’s hands crumple a rejected job application while a voiceover intones you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority282283 the ad was produced by alex castellanos who had also worked for strom thurmond284 quotes that helms made throughout his career also showed his racial intolerance285 to rob the negro of his reputation of thinking through a problem in his own fashion is about the same as trying to pretend that he doesnt have a natural instinct for rhythm and for singing and dancing – on criticism that a fictional character in his newspaper column was offensive 1956 time and time again i have said to the black citizens lets work together at one time in my acceptance speech i specifically mentioned that i wanted to work with them i said come to see me i had one delegation come to see me and they wanted some free money from washington – the news observer 1996 in 1995 on cnn‘s larry king live a caller praised helms for everything you’ve done to help keep down the niggers helms’ response was to salute the camera and say well thank you i think – wilmington starnews 91695 in july 1993 helms made several attempts to extend a patent on the united daughters of the confederacy insignia which included the confederate flag and needed to be renewed every 14 years initially it had been a rider on a bill for olestra a fat substitute but carol moseley braun then a freshman senator and the only black one discovered it and removed it in committee286 helms then introduced it directly onto the senate floor proposing an amendment to the national service bill which would provide educational grants in return for various forms of service with many senators unaware of what they were voting on he won a test vote 52 to 48 then senator moseley braun took the floor in outrage at the defense of a symbol of slavery287 she told the senate288 on this issue there can be no consensus it is an outrage it is an insult it is absolutely unacceptable to me and to millions of americans black or white that we would put the imprimatur of the united states senate on a symbol of this kind of idea this flag is the real flag of the confederacy she said it symbolized the civil war fought to try to preserve our nation to keep the states from separating themselves over the issue of whether or not my ancestors could be held as property as chattel as objects of trade and commerce in this country this is no small matter she said this is not a matter of little old ladies walking around doing good deeds there is no reason why these little old ladies cannot do good deeds anyway if they choose to wave the confederate flag that certainly is their right senator strom thurmond rose to support the amendment saying that the udc has nothing to do with discrimination289 but senator howell heflin of alabama supported moseley braun and said his family was rooted in the confederacy290 he said he thought they might be spinning in their graves but he would reverse himself and vote with senator moseley braun against the flag because we live today in a different world perhaps racism is one of the great scars and one of the most serious illnesses that we still suffer from today the senate was convinced by the argument that the flag was an insult and killed the helms amendment 75 to 25 as 27 senators changed their votes over three hours senator helms angrily insisted that his proposal had nothing to do with race or with slavery race should never have been introduced he said it is a political ploy in direct retaliation after the vote helms and moseley braun found themselves on the same elevator with senator orrin hatch and he began singing dixie sen carol moseleybraun recounts the story that helms entered the senate elevator saw her and began singing i wish i was in the land of cotton and then looked at sen hatch and said im going to make her cry im going to sing dixie until she cries an aide said that helms described it as a goodnatured exchange291 as the los angeles times said in the obituary for helms in 2008292 unlike other symbols of segregation – such as alabamas gov george c wallace and south carolinas longtime sen strom thurmond who eventually recanted their opposition to racial integration – helms held firm he rarely reached out to black voters who in the 2000 census composed nearly 25 of north carolinas population the key to helms longevity was a political strategy that allowed him to win election without appealing to the mainstream the use of direct mail to solicit campaign funds nationally was pioneered in the 1960s but helms perfected the approach he sought campaign contributions from conservatives nationally then used their money to air inflammatory advertisements that energized the passions of his conservative base at home he needed the white vote to win said merle black a professor of political science at emory university to get that he had to use explicit racial themes his was a kind of primitive conservatism views on homosexualityedit “ nothing positive happened to sodom and gomorrah and nothing positive is likely to happen to america if our people succumb to the drumbeats of support for the homosexual

urged that gays be allowed to serve openly in the armed forces helms said the president better have a bodyguard if he visited north carolina296 his views on gay and lesbian citizens were depicted in the 1998 documentary film dear jesse helms initially fought against increasing federal financing for hivaids research and treatment saying the disease resulted from unnatural and disgusting homosexual
