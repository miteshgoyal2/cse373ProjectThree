approximately 9000 bce 3000 to 5000 years after massive flooding of the columbia river which carved the columbia gorge1 anthropologists estimate there were 125 distinct northwest tribes and 50 languages and dialects in existence before the arrival of euroamericans in this region throughout the puget sound region coastal tribes made use of the regions abundant natural resources subsisting primarily on salmon halibut shellfish and whale cedar was an important building material and was used by tribes to build both longhouses and large canoes clothing was also made from the bark of cedar trees the columbia river tribes became the richest of the washington tribes through their control of celilo falls historically the richest salmon fishing location in the northwest these falls on the columbia river east of presentday the dalles oregon were part of the path millions of salmon took to spawn the presence of private wealth among the more aggressive coastal tribes encouraged gender divisions as women took on prominent roles as traders and men participated in warring and captivetaking with other tribes the eastern tribes called the plateau tribes survived through seasonal hunting fishing and gathering tribal work among the plateau indians was also genderdivided with both men and women responsible for equal parts of the food supply2 the principal tribes of the coastal areas include the chinook lummi quinault makah quileute and snohomish the plateau tribes include the klickitat cayuse nez percé okanogan palouse spokane wenatchee and yakama today washington contains more

twoship flotilla with the sonora landed near the mouth of the quinault river and claimed the coastal lands up to the russian possessions in the north in 1778 the british explorer captain james cook sighted cape flattery at the entrance to the strait of juan de fuca but the strait itself was not found until charles william barkley captain of the imperial eagle sighted it in 1787 barkley named it for juan de fuca the spanishbritish nootka conventions of the 1790s ended spanish exclusivity and opened the northwest coast to explorers and traders from other nations most important being britain russia and the united states further explorations of the straits were performed by spanish explorers manuel quimper in 1790 and francisco de eliza in 1791 and then by british captain george vancouver in 1792 captain vancouver claimed the sound for britain and named the waters south of the tacoma narrows pugets sound in honor of peter puget then a lieutenant accompanying him on the vancouver

expedition under direction from president thomas jefferson entered the state from the east on october 10 1805 meriwether lewis and william clark were surprised by the differences in indian tribes in the pacific northwest from those they had encountered earlier in the expedition noting in particular the increased status of women among both coastal and plateau tribes lewis hypothesized that the equality of women and the elderly with men was linked to more evenly distributed economic roles canadian explorer david thompson extensively explored the columbia river commencing in 1807 in 1811 he became the first european to navigate the entire length of the river to the pacific along the way he posted a notice where it joins the snake river claiming the land for britain and stating the intention of the north west company to build a fort there subsequently fort nez perces trading post was established near presentday walla walla washington thompsons notice was found by astorians looking to establish an inland fur post it contributed to david stuarts choice on behalf of the american pacific fur company of a more northerly site for their operations at fort okanogan before settlement in the 1830s when white women began moving to the territory métis women were sought after as wives for the traders a population of métis mixed race people grew as a result of centuries of sexual encounters between early european furtraders and indian women6 american–british occupation disputesedit main article oregon boundary dispute american interests in the region grew as part of the concept of manifest destiny spain ceded their rights north of the 42nd parallel to the united states by the 1819 adamsonís treaty but not possession which was disallowed by the terms of the nootka conventions britain had long standing commercial interests through the hudsons bay company and a well established network of fur trading forts along the columbia river in what it called columbia district these were headquartered from fort vancouver in presentday vancouver washington by the treaty of 1818 following from the war of 1812 great britain and the united states established the 49th parallel as the border west to the continental divide of the rocky mountains but agreed to joint control and occupancy of oregon country in 1824 russia signed an agreement with the us acknowledging it had no claims south of 5440 latitude north and russia signed a similar treaty with britain in 1825 joint occupancy was renewed but on a yeartoyear basis in 1827 eventually increased tension between us settlers arriving by the oregon trail and fur traders led to the oregon boundary dispute on june 15 1846 britain ceded its claims to the lands south of the 49th parallel and the us ceded its claims to the north of the same line in the present day canada–us border in the oregon treaty in 1848 the oregon territory composed of presentday washington oregon and idaho as well as parts of montana and wyoming was established washington territory which included washington and pieces of idaho and montana was formed from oregon territory in 1853 in 1872 an arbitration process settled the boundary dispute from the pig war and established the us–canada border through the san juan islands and gulf islands early american settlementsedit eastern washingtonedit settlements in the eastern part of the state were largely agricultural and focused around missionary establishments in the walla walla valley missionaries attempted to civilize the indians often in ways that disregarded or misunderstood native practices when missionaries dr marcus whitman and narcissa whitman refused to leave their mission as racial tensions mounted in 1847 14dubious – discuss american missionaries were killed by cayuse and umatilla indians explanations of the 1847 whitman massacre in walla walla include outbreaks of disease resentment over harsh attempts at conversion of both religion and way of life and contempt of the native indians shown by the missionaries particularly by narcissa whitmancitation needed the first white american woman in the oregon territory this event triggered the cayuse war against the indians followed by the yakima war together continuing until 1858 the provisional legislature of oregon in 1847 immediately raised companies of volunteers to go to war if necessary against the cayuse and to the discontent of some of the militia leaders also sent a peace commission the united states army later came to support the militia forces these militia forces eager for action provoked both friendly and hostile indians in 1850 five cayuse were convicted for murdering the whitmans in 1847 and hanged sporadic bloodshed continued until 1855 when the cayuse were decimated defeated bereft of their tribal lands and placed on the umatilla indian reservation in northeastern oregon the conflicts over the possession of land between the indians and the american settlers led the americans in 1855 by the treaties at the walla walla council to coerce not only the cayuse but also the walla walla and the umatilla tribes to the umatilla indian reservation in northeastern oregon fourteen other tribal groups to the yakama indian reservation in southern washington state and the nez perce to a reservation in the border region of washington oregon and idaho that same year gold was discovered in the newly established yakama reservation and white miners encroached upon these lands the tribes first the yakama eventually joined by the walla walla and the cayuse united together to fight the americans in what is called the yakima war the us army sent troops and a number of raids and battles took place in 1858 the americans at the battle of four lakes defeated the indians decisively in a newly imposed treaty tribes were again confined to reservations puget soundedit as american settlers moved west along the oregon trail some traveled through the northern part of the oregon territory and settled in the puget sound area the first settlement in the puget sound area in the west of what is now washington state was fort nisqually a farm and furtrading post owned by the pugets sound agricultural company a subsidiary of the hudsons bay company washingtons pioneer founder michael simmons along with the black pioneer george washington bush and his caucasian wife isabella james bush from missouri and tennessee respectively led four white families into the territory and settled new market now known as tumwater in 1846 they settled in washington to avoid oregons racist settlement laws7 after them many more settlers migrating overland along the oregon trail wandered north to settle in the puget sound area contrasted with other american occupations of the west there was comparativelycitation needed little violence between settlers and native americans though several exceptions such as territorial governor isaac ingalls stevens extensive campaigns in 1853 to force indians into ceding lands and rights are notable8 the puget sound war cayuse war yakima war and spokane war being the largest conflicts between the new american authorities and indigenous governments raids by haida tlingit and other northern tribes from british and russian territory terrorized native americans and settlers alike in puget sound in the 1850s see port gamble miners bound for the fraser canyon gold rush in british columbia in 1858 using the okanagan trail travelled under arms and there were many instances of violence along the route lumber industries drew settlers to the territory coastal cities like seattle founded in 1851 and originally called duwamps were established unlike the wagon trains that had carried entire families to the oregon territory these early trading settlements were populated primarily with single young men liquor gambling and prostitution were ubiquitous supported in seattle by one of the citys founders david swinson doc maynard who believed that wellrun prostitution could be a functional part of the economy the fraser gold rush in what would as a result become the colony of british columbia saw a flurry of settlement and merchant activity in northern puget sound which gave birth to port townsend and whatcom which became bellingham as commercial centres at first attempting to rival victoria as a disembarkation point of the goldfields until the colonys governor ordered that all access to the fraser river go via victoria despite the limitation on goldfieldrelated commerce many men who left the fraser river humbug as the rush was for a while misunderstood to be settled in whatcom and island counties some of these were settlers on san juan island during the pig war of 1859 upon the admission of the state of oregon
