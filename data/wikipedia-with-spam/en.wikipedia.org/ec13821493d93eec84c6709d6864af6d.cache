an american singer who spent over four decades in the public eye first as a child star with the jackson 5 and later as a solo artist during which time he went through various image changes starting in the mid1980s it became clear that jacksons appearance was changing dramatically the shape of his face particularly his nose triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery12 his skin tone became much lighter although jackson a black man was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo which results in white patches on the skin and said that he had not purposely bleached his skin but had used makeup to even out his skin tone3 it was also widely suggested that his lighter skin tone was partly due to skin bleaching124 jackson and some of his siblings said they had been physically and psychologically abused by their father joseph jackson in 2003 joseph admitted to whipping them as children but has emphatically rejected the longstanding abuse allegations56 the whippings deeply traumatized jackson and may have led to the onset of further health issues later in his life physicians speculated that he had body dysmorphic disorder7 at some point during the 1990s it appeared that jackson had become dependent on prescription drugs mainly painkillers and strong sedatives the drug use was later linked to second and thirddegree burns he had suffered years before as more and more difficulty emerged in his life he gradually became dependent on these drugs and his health deteriorated he went into rehabilitation in 1993 with the help of elizabeth taylor and elton john8 while preparing for a series of comeback concerts scheduled to begin in july 2009 jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication after suffering cardiac arrest on june 25 2009 his personal

mediumbrown color throughout his youth however starting in the mid 1980s his skin gradually grew paler which was partly due to vitiligo9 but also widely considered to be due to skin bleaching and changing of his features to appear white24 according to jacksons biographer j randy taraborrelli in 1984 jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo which taraborrelli stated was sometimes considered by doctors to be a consequence of damage done by bleaching chemicals over the years1 however vitiligo is a rare noncontagious disease the causes are not known but a range of genetic autoimmune and environmental factors are suspected to play a role in this disease between 1 and 2 of the world population is considered to be affected the depigmentation occurs in patches and affects all ethnicracial groups equally10 taraborrelli stated that jackson began making his nose smaller around the same time his skin became gradually lighter and was using the overthecounter skinbleaching cream called porcelana to achieve the lighter skin he said that jacksons sister la toya used porcelana too and that they had crates of this cream stored at their family home hayvenhurst hoarding it as the most valuable beauty product ever produced11 jacksons physical changes gained widespread media coverage and provoked criticism from the public2412 african american psychologists argued jackson was a lousy role model for black youth dr dennis chestnut said jackson gave black youth a feeling that they can achieve but also may encourage some people to think theyve got to be esoteric and idiosyncratic to be successful it was also presumed that jackson bleached his skin just to boost his career dr halford fairchild stated jackson and other african american celebrities would try to look more like white people in order to get in films and on television13 new york plastic surgeon dr pamela lipkin who has never treated jackson or reviewed his medical records said when you look at the other features the skin bleaching sort of goes along with what i think was his quest for beauty so i have to wonder what came first vitiligo or lighter skin noting that jackson had even skin tone when he was younger lipkins interpretation was that probably hes trying to look caucasian his skin is whiter his nose is getting thinner every six months his lips are getting thinner his eyebrows are getting higher his eyes are getting wider every time his cheekbones are getting bigger14 however in 1993 jackson told oprah winfrey there as i know of there is no such thing as skin bleaching ive never seen it i dont know what it is it was in this interview that jackson stated he had a skin disorder vitiligo and also stated that the disorder was hereditary rather than something he caused he also said he used makeup to even out the uneven skin tone it is something i cannot help explained jackson when people make up stories that i dont want to be who i am it hurts me its a problem for me i cant control it but what about all the millions of people who sit in the sun to become darker to become other than what they are nobody says nothing about that3 winfreys interview of jackson was watched by 62 million americans15 it also started a public discourse on the topic of vitiligo a relatively unknown condition before then12161718 jackson had publicly stated that he was proud to be black19 he also wrote a letter to photographer william pecchi jr in 1988 which reads maybe i look at the world through rose colored glasses but i love people all over the world that is why stories of racism really disturb me … because in truth i believe all men are created equal i was taught that and will always believe it i just can’t conceive of how a person could hate another because of skin color i love every race on the planet earth prejudice is the child of ignorance naked we come into the world and naked we shall go out and a very good thing too for it reminds me that i am naked under my shirt whatever its color20 taraborrelli stated that jackson was diagnosed with lupus that the vitiligo partially lightened his skin and the lupus was in remission and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight which could have caused his lupus condition to recur1 jacksons autopsy did not confirm or refute the claim that he had lupus but it did confirm that he had vitiligo2122 his skin was found to have reduced though not absent melanocytes the cells active in skin pigmentation23 to treat these conditions jackson used solaquin tretinoin and benoquin1 on june 29 2009 multiple tubes of benoquin and hydroquinone were found in jacksons home both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo dr david sawcer said some patients with vitiligo get to the point where it makes more sense to remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale24 on the other hand getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult25 depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun26 vitiligo patients are at risk to contract melanoma and an annual cancer checkup is recommended27 jackson also had hydroxychloroquine injected directly into his scalp regularly1 another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin27 the treatments jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone he could appear very pale1 for example stevie nicks recalled in a rolling stone interview i remember before we performed at bill clintons 1993 inauguration michael sent somebody to find out if i had any foundation makeup he could borrow i was using some light chanel foundation at that time and michael sent back a note to say thanks but the foundation wasnt quite light enough for him28 jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants in the music video for remember the time all dancers and actors except for jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient egyptians29 jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder30 vitiligo occurs in three different patterns segmental depigmentation means only one side of the body is affected whereas generalized depigmentation means many parts of the body are affected31 jacksons autopsy report states a focal depigmentation of the skin32 ie the depigmentation occurs on one or a few areas of the body31 in jacksons case there were 5 affected areas32 in 1996 during the australian leg of the history world tour jackson married his dermatologists nurse debbie rowe3334 the pair first met in the mid1980s when jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo she spent many years treating his illness as well as providing emotional support and they built a strong friendship before their marriage35 the couple divorced in 1999 and remained friends thereafter36 cosmetic procedures and dietedit jackson at the 1997 cannes film festival over time jacksons facial structure changed as well surgeons speculated he also had a rhinoplasty a forehead lift cheekbone surgery altered his lips and had a cleft put in his chin37 those close to the singer estimated that by 1990 he had undergone around ten procedures1 according to taraborrelli jackson had his first rhinoplasty after breaking his nose during a complex dance routine in 1979 however the surgery was not a complete success and he complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career he was referred to steven hoefflin who performed his second rhinoplasty in 198138 katherine jackson though has said in a recent interview that michael intentionally got his first nosejob from steven hoefflin taraborrelli stated jackson had a third rhinoplasty three years later and a fourth in 198639 jackson wrote in his 1988 autobiography moonwalk that in addition to the two rhinoplasties he also had a dimple created in his chin40 from 1986 onward he was a regular client of arnold klein a dermatologist who specializes in dermal filler injection a nonsurgical cosmetic procedure41 in his book jackson attributed the changes in the structure of his face to puberty a strict vegetarian diet weight loss a change in hair style and stage lighting40 jackson denied allegations that he had altered his eyes42 by 1990 the full extent of jacksons surgery was widely debated those close to him estimated he had undergone ten operations on his face up to this point1 in june 1992 the daily mirror ran a full frontpage picture allegedly of jacksons face which they described as hideously disfigured by plastic surgery jackson sued the tabloid and in 1998 they agreed to an outofcourt settlement with jackson at the high court the papers former editor acknowledged that after meeting jackson in person he believed that jackson was neither hideously disfigured nor scarred at all a daily mirror solicitor maintained that the publication did not tamper with the picture43 media reports stated that jacksons autopsy reported one scar beside each of his nostrils one scar behind each of his ears and two scars on his neck probably from cosmetic surgery44 plus cosmetic tattoos on his eyebrows around his eyes and lips and on his scalp at his receding hairline45 in the unedited version of the documentary living with michael jackson which was shown in court in 2005 jackson said he had two procedures on his nose so that he could breathe better46 when he was asked about his cheeks jackson answered these cheekbones no my father has the same thing we have indian blood47 health concernsedit over the years jackson had various medical problems that were covered by the media in early 1984 jackson was treated for scalp burns after his hair caught fire during a commercial shoot48 in june 1990 jackson was admitted to a santa monica hospital with chest pains49 according to dr mark zatzkis laboratory and xray tests of jacksons heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities the pains were caused by bruised ribs suffered during a vigorous dance practice50 various concerts were cancelled owing to illness and a remaining tour was called off due to addiction on march 12 1988 jackson cancelled a show in st louis which was rescheduled for march 14 on march 13 jackson performed in st louis although he was fighting a cold the cold progressed to laryngitis the

five shows in mexico city7375 the last concert of the dangerous tour was held in mexico city on november 11 199376 in november 1993 jackson announced the cancellation of the remaining dangerous tour due to an addiction to painkillers which had been prescribed after a recent constructive scalp surgery77 it was also reported jackson cancelled shows in russia and israel73 however these two concerts did take place7879 the rescheduling of the concert in israel was not due to health problems80 according to dr neil ratner jackson suffered a back injury in july 1997 after one of the stages collapsed during a concert in munich germany however the history tour continued there was only one concert cancelled after the fatal accident of princess diana about two months later81 in fact such an incident happened during a charity concert in munich in 1999 jackson was later taken to a hospital jacksons promoter marcel avram said he jackson received abrasions and bruises82 jackson left the hospital the next morning83 on february 1584 2005 jackson was admitted to the marian medical center in santa maria with flulike symptoms according to dr chuck merrill jackson was in stable condition and would recover within a few days85 jackson left the hospital on february 16 2005 dr todd bailey said jackson continued to need care for some persistent viral symptoms but otherwise he was in good spirits84 one week later the jury selection for the child molestation trial resumed in jacksons presence86 on march 10 2005 jackson appeared late in court after having received treatment in a hospital87 due to a back problem88 during the trial jackson occasionally needed help to get to his seat87 on june 5 2005 jackson was taken to the emergency room at the santa ynez valley cottage hospital to seek treatment of a back pain jacksons spokeswoman raymone bain said stress contributed to the back problem88 during the trial jackson had briefly been in hospital several times89 dr christopher rogers testified in the trial against dr conrad murray that in his opinion jackson was healthier than the average person of his age 90 rogers said the arteries around jacksons heart were free of fat and cholesterol which is unusual for a 50yearold individual91 childhood and mental healthedit another publicly discussed aspect of jacksons private life is his childhood particularly his relationship with his father jackson and some of his siblings stated that they were physically and mentally abused by their father joseph from a young age through incessant rehearsals whippings and the use of derogatory names such as big nose for michael this abuse had affected michael throughout his life92 in one altercation—later recalled by marlon jacksonjoseph held michael upside down by one leg and pummeled him over and over again with his hand hitting him on his back and buttocks93 joseph would often trip the boys or push them into walls93 one night while jackson was asleep joseph climbed into his room through the bedroom window wearing a fright mask he entered the room screaming and shouting joseph said he wanted to teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep for a number of years afterward jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom93 by the early 1980s he was deeply unhappy jackson explained even at home im lonely i sit in my room sometimes and cry its so hard to make friends i sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night just hoping to find someone to talk to but i just end up coming home94 although it had been reported for a number of years that jackson had an abusive childhood he first spoke openly about it in his 1993 interview with oprah winfrey he grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years acknowledging that he often cried from loneliness121617 in the same interview speaking of his father jackson said there were times when hed come to see me id get sick id start to regurgitate im sorry please dont be mad at me but i do love him95 in jacksons other high profile interview living with michael jackson 2003 he covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse93 jackson recalled that joseph sat in a chair as the group rehearsed saying he had this belt in his hand if you didnt do it the right way he would tear you up really get you it was bad real bad96 both of jacksons parents have rejected the longstanding allegations of child abuse by saying that spankings were common when disciplining children back then69798 the child abuse allegations polarized some of the siblings with some of them rejecting the claims99100 in 2003 jackson was accused of child sexual abuse and was acquitted two years later during the investigation jacksons profile was examined by stan katz a mental health professional who spent several hours with the accuser as well according to taraborrelli the assessment made by katz was that jackson had become a regressed tenyearold101 some medical professionals have publicly stated their belief that jackson also had body dysmorphic disorder a psychological condition whereby the sufferer has no concept of how his or her physical appearance is perceived by others1 weight and drug addictionedit the changes to his face were in part due to periods of significant weight loss102 jackson became slimmer in the early 1980s because of a change in diet and a desire for a dancers body38 by 1984 jackson had lost 20 pounds 91 kg bringing his weight to 105 pounds 48 kg on a 5foot9inch 175 m frame the slimmest he had ever been as an adult103 witnesses reported that jackson was often dizzy and speculated that he was suffering from anorexia nervosa103 following accusations of child molestation in 1993 jackson stopped eating losing even more weight104 in late 1995 jackson was rushed to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance which was subsequently cancelled a nonrelated writer claims that the incident was caused by a stressrelated panic attack105 while medics cited irregular beats gastrointestinal inflammation dehydration and kidney and liver irregularities106 in none of these hospitalizations including this one did medics find drugs in jacksons system107108 the bbc reported that during his 2005 trial the singer again suffered from stressrelated illnesses and severe weight loss109 a biographer states that in 1993 the entertainer admitted taking valium xanax and ativan to deal with the stress of the child sexual abuse allegations made against him110 while jackson himself does not mention sedatives he stated that painkillers were prescribed to soothe excruciating pain that he was suffering after recent reconstructive surgery on his scalp resulting from his accident in 1984111 a few months after the allegations became news jackson had lost approximately 10 pounds 45 kg in weight and had stopped eating104 in a court deposition unrelated to alleged child abuse jackson was visibly drowsy lacked concentration and repeatedly slurred while speaking he could not remember the dates of his prior album releases or names of people he had worked with it took him several minutes to name some of his recent albums112 jackson also stated during the 1993 interview that he first began taking painkiller medications regularly in 1984 on january 24 of that year jackson was filming a pepsi commercial when his hair caught on fire from faulty pyrotechnics on stage that were intended to be part of one of many being filmed he sustained seconddegree burns to his scalp and never fully recovered from the injury or from the lingering pain he reportedly began taking the painkillers after refusing at first in order to deal with the intense pain on november 9 and november 10 1993 jackson was questioned about a copyright matter according to the sworn declaration from the plaintiffs lawyer he had been told that jackson was taking painkillers because of recent oral surgery in november 1993 jackson announced that he was addicted to painkillers he said he had recently undergone a scalp surgery and the painkillers had been prescribed jackson said due to the pressure caused by the child molestation allegations and the energy he needed for the dangerous tour he was physically and emotionally exhausted he said he had become increasingly more dependent on painkillers and would seek treatment113 his lawyers said jackson would be treated for addiction overseas for one and a half months to two months114 in december 1993 jackson returned to the united states115 jacksons health had deteriorated to the extent that he cancelled the remainder of his tour and flew with friends elizabeth taylor and her husband to london when the singer arrived at the airport he had to be held up by his two friends he was then rushed to the home of elton johns manager and then to a clinic8116 he was searched for drugs on entry vials of medicine were found in a suitcase he took over the fourth floor of the hospital and was put on valium iv to wean him from painkillers8116 the singers spokesperson then told reporters that jackson was barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level8116 while in the clinic jackson took part in group and oneonone therapy sessions116 according to taraborrelli in january 2004 as his trial approached jackson became dependent on morphine and demerol and was being treated for this dependency by herbalist alfredo bowman in colorado117 in an interview with aphrodite jones patrick treacy a cosmetic surgeon who treated jackson between july 2006 and early 2007 as well as shortly before his death stated that he would have known if jackson would have been also treated by another physician and that he never saw any drugs in the house he also said that jackson did not have insomnia and never asked him for narcotics treacy stated jackson was in good physical health he said jackson always insisted on the presence of an anesthetist when propofol was administered118119 jackson was 5 ft 9 in and weighed 136 lbs which would be within a normal weight range although he was thin dr rogers testified in court91 according to his costumer michael bush jackson lost so much weight during a concert due to loss of water that the costumes jackson wore at the end of the show had to be smaller than those he wore at the beginning of the show usually he was a 28inch waist120 according to dr nader kamangar a sleeping expert at ucla drugs such as demerol can cause insomnia in the case of jackson insomnia could have been caused by anxiety for performing as well121 following jacksons death a police warrant issued against his attending physician conrad murray stated that jacksons many doctors had used nineteen distinct aliases such as omar arnold josephine baker fernand diaz paul farance peter madonie faheem muhammad roselyn muhammad blanca nicholas jimmy nicholas bryan singleton frank tyson and rob kaufman while prescribing medications for jackson he also took prescriptions as prince michael amir and kai chase the names of one of his sons his spokesperson and his former personal chef respectively122 police found a cd mentioning the omar arnold alias when they raided the las vegas nevada home and office of conrad murray jacksons personal physician123 use of pseudonyms by celebrities doctors is common practice for maintaining the confidentiality of patients medical history 124 and does not necessarily indicate addiction125 deathedit main article death of michael jackson following jacksons death reports of his use of pethidine demerol surfaced126 cherilyn lee a nurse who provided nutritional counseling to jackson said that on april 12 2009 he asked her for unspecified products for sleep on april 19 2009 he told her the only medicine that would help was propofol127 lee refused telling him michael the only problem with you taking this medication is youre going to take it and youre not going to wake up jackson dismissed the warning telling her he had been given the drug before by iv injection and that his doctor told him it was safe128 he did not name the doctor an overdose of propofol can cause the patient to stop breathing leading to a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the body which can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest129 it was the last time they met130 due to an enquiry about a cancellation insurance for the upcoming tour insurance carriers demanded a medical exam by a doctor they trusted in february 2009 jackson had an examination performed by dr david slavit of new york later the broker told an aeg senior vice president jackson had only slight hay fever and had passed the exam with flying colors a second medical exam was supposed to take place on july 6 2009131 according to lee she received a frantic call on june 21 2009 from an aide on jacksons staff the aide reported that jackson was feeling ill lee reported overhearing jackson complain that one side of his body was hot the other side cold she believed that somebody had given him something that affected his central nervous system she advised the aide to take him to the hospital128132 after his death the autopsy report revealed that jackson had a strong heart and was a fairly healthy 50yearold according to bbc his weight was in the acceptable range for a man of his height but he had punctured arms and suffered from lung damage and some arthritis133 the document shows that jacksons most serious health problem was his chronically inflamed lungs but this was not serious enough to be a contributing factor to his death the post mortem did not uncover any physical problems that may have limited jacksons ability to perform133 his overall health was fine said dr zeev kain of the university of california who reviewed the report for ap but was not involved in the postmortem examination the results are in normal limits the autopsy also revealed that he was partially bald and that his lips eyebrows and scalp were tattooed133 in 2011 dr rogers said in his testimony the theory that seems less reasonable to me is that mr jackson woke up and although he was under the influence of sedative medications managed to give himself another dose134 toxicologist dan anderson testified that demerol was not detected in jacksons system135 see alsoedit michael jackson portal peter pan syndrome referencesedit a b c d e f g h i j taraborrelli pp 434–436 a b c d
