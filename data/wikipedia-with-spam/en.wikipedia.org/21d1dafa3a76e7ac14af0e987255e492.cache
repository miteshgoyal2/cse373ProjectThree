198453 soon after conways interview sales of the book had increased by 9500 which the new york times and others attributed to conways use of the phrase making it the numberone bestseller on amazoncom54 american thinker a conservative daily magazine claimed that alternative facts was a commonly used legal phrase and was known to most lawyers55 however the guardian a british daily

bowling green terrorists both of whom had pleaded guilty to carrying out and supporting attacks on american soldiers in iraq59 there was never any suggestion that they had planned to carry out attacks in the united states60 on february 5 2017 new york university journalism professor jay rosen argued that given repeated misstatements of fact conway should cease being booked as a guest on television news shows cnn opted not to book conway as a guest that day because of what the network said were serious questions about her credibility6162 ethics violation allegations and investigationedit on february 9 2017 during an appearance on fox friends conway discussed department store nordstroms decision to drop products supplied by ivanka trumps business go buy ivankas stuff is what i would tell you said conway she elaborated its a wonderful line i own some of it im going to give a free commercial here go buy it today everybody you can find it online6364 within hours two organizations filed formal ethics complaints against conway for violating federal law prohibiting use of a federal position for the endorsement of any product service or enterprise65 public citizen asked the office of governmental ethics oge to investigate saying that conways remarks reflected an ongoing careless regard of the conflicts of interest laws and regulations of some members of the trump family and trump administration the groups president robert weissman declared since she said it was an advertisement that both eliminates any question about whether outsiders are unfairly reading into whats being said and two it makes clear that wasnt an inadvertent remark66 citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington filed a similar complaint with the oge and with the white house counsels office67 the groups executive director noah bookbinder stated this seems to us to be about as clearcut a violation as you can find68 laurence tribe told the new york times that you couldn’t think of a clearer example of violating the ban of using your government position as kind of a walking billboard for products or services offered by a private individual adding she is attempting quite crudely to enrich ivanka and therefore the presidents family68 chris lu deputy secretary of labor in the obama administration complained to jason chaffetz chair of the united states house committee on oversight and government reform that conway had violated federal ethics laws69 also saying on twitter that under obama if we did what kellyannepolls did we wouldve been fired70 rep elijah cummings also wrote to chaffetz to refer conway for discipline71 richard painter chief ethics attorney for george w bush declined to say whether he thought conways statements broke the law but that such actions would not have been tolerated in the bush administration the events of the past week demonstrate that there is no intent on the part of the president his family or the white house staff to make meaningful distinctions between his official capacity as president and the trump family business68 at the regularly scheduled afternoon press briefing sean spicer told reporters that kellyanne has been counseled and thats all we are going to go with shes been counseled on the subject and thats it71 conways comments drew bipartisan congressional condemnation chaffetz a republican called them clearly over the line and unacceptable cummings a democrat and the committees ranking member called them jawdropping72 both chaffetz and cummings wrote the united states office of government ethics on february 9 2017 requesting that conways behavior be investigated and that the office recommend suggested disciplinary action if warranted8 banned from morning joeedit on february 15 2017 one national news show morning joe on msnbc banned her from future appearances we know for a fact that she tries to book herself on this show i won’t do it because i don’t believe in fake news or information that is not true every time i’ve ever seen her on television something’s askew off or incorrect the shows cohost mika brzezinski said31 the shows primary host joe scarborough said the decision to ban conway from future appearances was based on her being out of the loop and in none of the key meetings shes not briefed she’s just saying things just to get in front of the tv to prove her relevance he said31 on february 15 2017 washington post columnist jennifer rubin agreed that conway should be banned from future television appearances in recent days george stephanopoulos and matt lauer blasted her directly essentially calling her a fabulist given all that it would be irresponsible for any news show to put her out there suggesting she really does not know what is going on at any given moment
