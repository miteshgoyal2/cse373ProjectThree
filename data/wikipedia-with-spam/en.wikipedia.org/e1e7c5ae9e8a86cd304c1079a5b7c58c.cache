beatboxing have been present in many american musical genres since the 19th century such as early rural music both black and white religious songs blues ragtime vaudeville and hokum examples include the appalachian technique of eefing and the blues song bye bye bird by sonny boy williamson ii additional influences may perhaps include forms of african traditional music in which performers utilize their bodies eg by clapping or stomping as percussion instruments and produce sounds with their mouths by breathing loudly in and out a technique used in beatboxing today45 many wellknown performers used vocal percussion occasionally even though this was not directly connected to the cultural tradition that came to be known as beatboxing paul mccartneys that would be something 1969 includes vocal percussion pink floyds pow r toc h 1967 also includes vocal percussion performed by the groups lead vocalist syd barrett jazz singers bobby mcferrin and al jarreau were very well known for their vocal styles and techniques which have had great impact on techniques beatboxers use today michael jackson was known to record himself beatboxing on a dictation tape recorder as a demo and scratch recording to compose several of his songs including billie jean the girl is mine and others6 gert fröbe a german actor most widely known for playing auric goldfinger in the james bond film goldfinger beatboxes as colonel manfred von holstein simultaneously vocalizing horned and percussive instruments in those magnificent men in their flying machines a 1965 british comedy film contribution to hiphopedit the term beatboxing is derived from the mimicry of early drum machines then known as beatboxes particularly the roland tr8081 the term beatbox was used to refer to earlier roland drum machines such as the tr55 and cr78 in the 1970s7 they were followed by the tr808 released in 1980 which became central to hip hop music7 and electronic dance music1 it is the tr808 that human beatboxing is largely modeled after1 human beatboxing in hiphop originated in the 1980s its early pioneers include doug e fresh the selfproclaimed first human beatbox8 swifty the first to implement the inhale sound techniquecitation needed buffy who helped perfect many beatboxing techniques9 and wise who contributed significantly to beat boxings proliferationcitation needed wise inspired an entire new fan base of human beatboxers with his human turntable technique other pioneers of beatboxing include rahzel well known for his realistic robotic sounds and for his ability to sing and beatbox simultaneously scratch a beatboxer and musician well known for further revolutionizing the use of vocal scratching in beatboxing and kenny muhammad the human orchestra a beatboxer known for his technicality and outstanding rhythmic precision who pioneered the inward k snare a beatbox technique that imitates a snare drum by breathing inward modern beatboxingedit the internet has played a large part in the popularity of modern beatboxing alex tew aka aplus started the first online community of beatboxers in 2000 under the banner of humanbeatboxcom in 2001 gavin tyte a member of this community created the worlds first tutorials and video tutorials on beatboxing in 2003 the community held the worlds first human beatbox convention in london featuring beatbox artists from all over the world beatboxings current popularity is due in part to releases from artists such as rahzel roxorloops reeps one and alem10 sometimes modern beatboxers will use their hand or another part of their body to extend the spectrum of sound effects and rhythm some have developed a technique that involves blowing and sucking air around their fingers to produce a very realistic record scratching noise which is commonly known as the crab scratch another hand technique includes the throat tap which involves the beatboxer tapping their fingers against their throat as they throat sing or hum today there is an increase in the variety in which we see beatboxing throughout musical culture people have gone as far as adding beatboxing in with different instruments to create a completely different sound unlike any other artist greg patillo goes as far as adding in beatboxing while playing the flute to very iconic songs beatbox has become modernized and has even been seen in popular movies such as pitch perfect and pitch perfect 2 both of these movies showcase classical songs performed with a capella covers in which all of the beats to the songs are done completely using the idea and technique of beatboxing to complete the sound capable to imitate the original song notationedit as with other musical disciplines some form of musical notation or transcription may sometimes be useful in order to describe beatbox patterns or performances sometimes this takes the form of ad hoc phonetic approximations but is occasionally more formal standard beatbox notation sbn was created by mark splinter and gavin tyte11 of humanbeatboxcom in 200612 as an alternative to international phonetic alphabet ipa transcription which had been used sparingly before then in a research study published in 2013 and based on realtime mri imaging of a beatboxer the authors propose a notation system which combines the international phonetic alphabet with musical staff notation in part motivated by their observation that many beatboxing sounds can be adequately represented by the ipa13 phonologyedit each beatboxer can produce an infinite number of unique sounds but there are three distinct linguistic categories of sound within beatboxing ejectives are the strong puffs of air from the voicebox that give intensity to percussive sounds the t p k d b and g sounds can all be made into ejectives “ch” and “j” are examples of ejective affricates nonstandard fricatives are the mechanical sounds such as snare drums cymbals and other buzzing noises in beatboxing that are made with fricatives certain sounds such as velar lateral fricatives bilabial lateral fricatives and linguolabial fricatives are all judged impossible according to the ipa but are technically possible and are sounds that are commonly used in beatboxing 14 coarticulation is the act of controlling a sound in two places at once a common example of this is the sound created by rolling an “r” sound while saying a “v” sound this is called a voiced alveolar trill with labiodental articulation similarly epenthesis is the sound created when beatboxers sing and do percussion at the same time contrary to what the sound suggests heir tongue is not in two places at once this effect is created by placing percussive sounds in the middle of words 15 multivocalismedit multivocalism is a form of vocal musicianship conceptualized by british beatboxer and vocalist killa kela it describes beatboxers who incorporate other vocal disciplines and practices into their routines and performances such as singing rapping sound mimicry and other vocal arts beardyman is a well known multivocalist world recordsedit according to the guinness world records the current record for the largest human beatbox ensemble was set by bookingcom employees
