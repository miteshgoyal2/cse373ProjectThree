billboard yearend from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article includes a list of references but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations february 2012 learn how and when to remove this template message billboard yearend charts are a cumulative measure of a single or albums performance in the united states based upon the billboard magazine charts during any given chart year billboards chart year runs from the first billboard week of december to the final week in november but because the billboard week is dated in advance of publication the last calendar week for which sales are counted is usually the third week in november1 this altered calendar allows for billboard to calculate yearend charts and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of december prior to incorporating chart data from nielsen soundscan from 1991 yearend charts were calculated by an inversepoint system based solely on a titles performance for example a single appearing on the billboard hot 100 would be given one point for a week spent at position 100 two points for a week spent at position ninetynine and so forth up to 100 points for each week spent at number one other factors including the total weeks a song spent on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into its yearend total the same method was used for albums based on the billboard 200 and songs appearing on the other charts eg hot country singlescitation needed after billboard began obtaining sales and airplay information from nielsen soundscan and nielsen broadcast data systems the yearend charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales or sales and airplay pointscitation needed this gives a more accurate picture of any given years most popular titles as an entry that hypothetically spent nine weeks at number one in the spring could possibly have earned fewer cumulative points than one spending six weeks at number three in january due to this methodology albums at the peak of their popularity at the time of the novemberdecember chartyear cutoff many times end up ranked lower than one would expect on a yearend tally yet are ranked on the following years chart as well as their cumulative points are split between the two chart years contents 1 billboard yearend number ones 2 see also 3 references 4 sources billboard yearend number onesedit main article list of billboard yearend numberone singles and
