was putting the pi up for sale910 the paper would be put on the market for 60 days and if a buyer could not be found within that time the paper would either be turned into an internetonly publication with a drastically reduced staff or closed outright910 the news of the papers impending sale was initially broken by local station kingtv the night prior to the official announcement and came as a surprise to the pis staff and the owners of rival newspaper the seattle times analysts did not expect a buyer to be found in view of declining circulation in the us newspaper industry and other newspapers on the market going unsold9 five days before the 60day deadline the pi reported that the hearst corporation had given several pi reporters provisional job offers for an online edition of the pi11 on march 16 2009 the newspaper posted a headline on its front page followed shortly after by a short news story that explained that the following days edition would be its final one in

operating agreementedit from 1983 to 2009 the pi and the seattle times had a joint operating agreement joa whereby advertising production marketing and circulation were run for both papers by the seattle times company they maintained separate news and editorial departments the papers published a combined sunday edition although the times handled the majority of the editorial content while the pi only provided a small editorialopinions section in 2003 times tried to cancel the joa citing a clause in it that three consecutive years of losses were cause for cancelling the agreement14 hearst disagreed and immediately filed suit to prevent the times from cancelling the agreement hearst argued that a force majeure clause prevented the times from claiming losses in 2000 and 2001 as reason to end the joa because they resulted from extraordinary events in this case a sevenweek newspaper strike each side publicly accused the other of attempting to put its rival out of business the trial judge granted a summary judgment in hearsts favor on the force majeure issue but after two appeals the washington state supreme court ruled in favor of the times on june 30 2005 on the force majeure clause reversing the trialcourt judge the two papers settled the issue on april 16 2007 the joa ended in 2009 with the cessation of the pi print edition12 awardsedit the pi was notable for its twotime
