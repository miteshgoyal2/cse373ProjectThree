the district but was unable to overcome flynts lead in the more rural areas20 gingrichs relative success surprised political analysts flynt had never faced a serious challenger gingrich was the second republican to ever run against him21 he did well against flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the watergate scandal of the nixon

opportunity in which publicity expenses were covered by a limited partnership it raised 105000 from republican political supporters to promote sales of gingrichs book31 gingrichs success in forcing

gingrichs first formal position of power within the republican party34 he said his intention to build a much more aggressive activist party33 early in his role as whip in may 1989 gingrich was

gingrich himself was among members of the house who had written nsf checks on the house bank he had overdrafts on twentytwo checks including a 9463 check to the internal revenue service in 199036 gingrichs official portrait as a congressman in 1990 after consulting focus groups37 with the help of pollster frank luntz38 gopac distributed a memo with a cover letter signed by gingrich titled language a key mechanism of control that encouraged republicans to speak like newt it contained lists of contrasting words—words with negative connotations such as radical sick and traitors—and optimistic positive governing words such as opportunity courage and principled that gingrich recommended for use in describing democrats and republicans respectively37 due to population increases recorded in the 1990 united states census georgia picked up an additional seat for the 1992 us house elections however the democraticcontrolled georgia general assembly under the leadership of fiercely partisan speaker of the house tom murphy specifically targeted gingrich eliminating the district which he gingrich represented39 gerrymandering split gingrichs territory among three neighboring districts much of the southern portion of gingrichs district including his home in carrollton was drawn into the columbusbased 3rd district represented by fiveterm democrat richard ray gingrich remarked that the speaker by raising money and gerrymandering has sincerely dedicated a part of his career to wiping me out39 at the same time the assembly created a new heavily republican 6th district in fulton and cobb counties in the wealthy northern suburbs of atlanta—an area that gingrich had never represented gingrich sold his home in carrollton and moved to marietta in the new 6th his primary opponent state representative herman clark made an issue out of gingrichs 22 overdraft checks in the house bank scandal and also criticized gingrich for moving into the district after a recount gingrich prevailed by 980 votes with a 51 to 49 result40 his winning the primary all but assured him of election in november he was reelected three times from this district against nominal democratic oppositioncitation needed republican revolution of 1994edit main article republican revolution in the 1994 campaign season in an effort to offer an alternative to democratic policies and to unite distant wings of the republican party gingrich and several other republicans came up with a contract with america which laid out ten policies that republicans promised to bring to a vote on the house floor during the first hundred days of the new congress if they won the election41 the contract was signed by gingrich and other republican candidates for the house of representatives the contract ranged from issues such as welfare reform term limits tougher crime laws and a balanced budget law to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on american military participation in united nations missionscitation needed in the november 1994 elections republicans gained 54 seats and took control of the house for the first time since 1954 longtime house minority leader bob michel of illinois had not run for reelection giving gingrich the highestranking republican returning to congress the inside track at becoming speaker the midterm election that turned congressional power over to republicans changed the center of gravity in the nations capital42 time magazine named gingrich its 1995 man of the year for his role in the election3 speaker of the houseedit main article contract with america gingrichs official portrait as speaker the house fulfilled gingrichs promise to bring all ten of the contracts issues to a vote within the first 100 days of the session president clinton called it the contract on america43 legislation proposed by the 104th united states congress included term limits for congressional representatives tax cuts welfare reform and a balanced budget amendment as well as independent auditing of the finances of the house of representatives and elimination of nonessential services such as the house barbershop and shoeshine concessions following gingrichs first two years as house speaker the republican majority was reelected in the 1996 election the first time republicans had done so in 68 years and the first time simultaneously with a democratic president winning reelection44 legislationedit welfare reformedit a central pledge of president bill clintons campaign was to reform the welfare system adding changes such as work requirements for recipients however by 1994 the clinton administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program gingrich accused clinton of stalling on welfare and proclaimed that congress could pass a welfare reform bill in as little as 90 days he insisted that the republican party would continue to apply political pressure to the president to approve their welfare legislation45 in 1996 after constructing two welfare reform bills that clinton vetoed46 gingrich and his supporters pushed for passage of the personal responsibility and work opportunity act which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system the act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery while also reducing the federal governments responsibilities it instituted the temporary assistance for needy families program which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding aid to families with dependent children program other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility reductions in immigrant welfare assistance and work requirements for recipients47 the bill was signed into law by president clinton on august 22 1996citation needed in his 1998 book lessons learned the hard way gingrich encouraged volunteerism and spiritual renewal placing more importance on families creating tax incentives and reducing regulations for businesses in poor neighborhoods and increasing property ownership by lowincome families he also praised habitat for humanity for sparking the movement to improve peoples lives by helping them build their own homes48 balancing the federal budgetedit although congressional republicans had opposed clintons deficit reduction act of 1993 a key aspect of the 1994 contract with america was the promise of a balanced federal budget after the end of the government shutdown gingrich and other republican leaders acknowledged that congress would not be able to draft a balanced budget in 1996 instead they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the white house and to wait until the next election season49 by may 1997 republican congressional leaders reached a compromise with democrats and president clinton on the federal budget the agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002 the plan included a total of 152 billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years50 other major parts of the spending plan called for 115 billion to be saved through a restructuring of medicare 24 billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor tax credits for college tuition and a 2 billion welfaretowork jobs initiative5152 president clinton signed the budget legislation in august 1997 at the signing gingrich gave credit to ordinary americans stating it was their political will that brought the two parties together50 in early 1998 with the economy performing better than expected increased tax revenues helped reduce the federal budget deficit to below 25 billion clinton submitted a balanced budget for 1999 three years ahead of schedule originally proposed making it the first time the federal budget had been balanced since 1969citation needed taxpayer relief act of 1997edit in 1997 president clinton signed into effect the taxpayer relief act of 1997 which included the largest capital gains tax cut in us history under the act the profits on the sale of a personal residence 500000 for married couples 250000 for singles were exempted if lived in for at least 2 years over the last 5 this had previously been limited to a 125000 onceinalifetime exemption for those over the age of 5553 there were also reductions in a number of other taxes on investment gains5455 additionally the act raised the value of inherited estates and gifts that could be sheltered from taxation55 gingrich has been credited with creating the agenda for the reduction in capital gains tax especially in the contract with america which set out to balance the budget and implement decreases in estate and capital gains tax some republicans felt that the compromise reached with clinton on the budget and tax act was inadequate56 however gingrich has stated that the tax cuts were a significant accomplishment for the republican congress in the face of opposition from the clinton administration57 gingrich along with bob dole had earlier setup the kemp commission headed by former us secretary of housing and urban development jack kemp a tax reform commission that made several recommendations including that dividends interest and capital gains should be untaxed5859 other legislationedit among the first pieces of legislation passed by the new congress under gingrich was the congressional accountability act of 1995 which subjected members of congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees including the civil rights act of 1964 and the americans with disabilities act of 1990 as a provision of the contract with america the law was symbolic of the new republican majoritys goal to remove some of the entitlements enjoyed by congress the bill received near universal acceptance from the house and senate and was signed into law on january 23 199560 gingrich shut down the highly regarded office of technology assessment and relied instead on what the bulletin of the atomic scientists called selfinterested lobbyists and think tanks61 government shutdownedit main article united states federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996 gingrich and the incoming republican majoritys promise to slow the rate of government spending conflicted with the presidents agenda for medicare education the environment and public health leading to two temporary shutdowns of the federal government totaling 28 days62 clinton said republican amendments would strip the us treasury of its ability to dip into federal trust funds to avoid a borrowing crisis republican amendments would have limited appeals by deathrow inmates made it harder to issue health safety and environmental regulations and would have committed the president to a sevenyear balanced budget clinton vetoed a second bill allowing the government to keep operating beyond the time when most spending authority expires62 a gop amendment opposed by clinton would not only have increased medicare part b premiums but it would also cancel a scheduled reduction the republicans held out for an increase in medicare part b premiums in january 1996 to 5350 a month clinton favored the then current law which was to let the premium that seniors pay drop to 425062 the government closed most nonessential offices during the shutdown which was the longest in us history the shutdown ended when clinton agreed to submit a cboapproved balanced budget plan63 during the crisis gingrichs public image suffered from the perception that the republicans hardline budget stance was owed partly to an alleged snub of gingrich by clinton during a flight on air force one to and from yitzhak rabins funeral in israel64 that perception developed after the trip when gingrich while being questioned by larserik nelson at a christian science monitor breakfast said that he was dissatisfied that clinton had not invited him to discuss the budget during the flight65 he complained that he and dole were instructed to use the planes rear exit to deplane saying the snub was part of why you ended up with us sending down a tougher continuing resolution66 in response to gingrichs complaint that they were forced to use the rear door nbc news released their videotape footage showing both gingrich and dole disembarking at tel aviv just behind clinton via the front stairway67 gingrich was widely lampooned for implying that the government shutdown was a result of his personal grievances including a widely shared editorial cartoon depicting him as a baby throwing a tantrum68 democratic leaders including chuck schumer took the opportunity to attack gingrichs motives for the budget standoff6970 in 1998 gingrich said that these comments were his single most avoidable mistake as speaker71 discussing the impact of the government shutdown on the republican party gingrich later commented that everybody in washington thinks that was a big mistake theyre exactly wrong there had been no reelected republican majority since 1928 part of the reason we got reelected  is our base thought we were serious and they thought we were serious because when it came to a showdown we didnt flinch72 in a 2011 oped in the washington post gingrich said that the government shutdown led to the balancedbudget deal in 1997 and the first four consecutive balanced budgets since the 1920s as well as the first reelection of a republican majority since 192873 ethics charges and reprimandedit vice president al gore house speaker newt gingrich and president bill clinton at the 1997 state of the union address eightyfour ethics charges were filed by democrats against gingrich during his term as speaker all were eventually dropped except for one claiming taxexempt status for a college course run for political purposes74 on january 21 1997 the house officially reprimanded gingrich in a vote of 395 in favor 28 opposed and ordered him to reimburse the house for some of the costs of the investigation in the amount of 300000757677 it was the first time a speaker was disciplined for an ethics violation7778 additionally the house ethics committee concluded that inaccurate information supplied to investigators represented intentional or  reckless disregard of house rules79 the ethics committees special counsel james m cole concluded that gingrich had violated federal tax law and had lied to the ethics panel in an effort to force the committee to dismiss the complaint against him the full committee panel did not agree whether tax law had been violated and left that issue up to the irs79 in 1999 the irs cleared the organizations connected with the renewing american civilization courses under investigation for possible tax violations80 regarding the situation gingrich said in january 1997 i did not manage the effort intensely enough to thoroughly direct or review information being submitted to the committee on my behalf in my name and over my signature inaccurate incomplete and unreliable statements were given to the committee but i did not intend to mislead the committee  i brought down on the peoples house a controversy which could weaken the faith people have in their government81 leadership challengeedit in the summer of 1997 several house republicans attempted to replace him as speaker claiming gingrichs public image was a liability the attempted coup began july 9 with a meeting of republican conference chairman john boehner of ohio and republican leadership chairman bill paxon of new york according to their plan house majority leader dick armey house majority whip tom delay boehner and paxon were to present gingrich with an ultimatum resign or be voted out however armey balked at the proposal to make paxon the new speaker and told his chief of staff to warn gingrich82 on july 11 gingrich met with senior republican leadership to assess the situation he explained that under no circumstance would he step down if he was voted out there would be a new election for speaker this would allow for the possibility that democrats along with dissenting republicans would vote in democrat dick gephardt as speaker on july 16 paxon offered to resign his post feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly as the only member of the leadership who had been appointed to his position—by gingrich—instead of elected83 resignationedit in 1998 republicans lost five seats in the house—the worst midterm performance in 64 years by a party not holding the presidency gingrich who won his reelection was held largely responsible for republican losses in the house his private polls had given his fellow republican congress the impression that pushing the lewinsky scandal would damage clintons popularity and result in the party winning a net total of six to thirty seats in the us house of representatives in this election84 the day after the election a republican caucus ready to rebel against him prompted his resignation of the speakership he also announced his intended and eventual full departure from the house in january 199985 when relinquishing the speakership gingrich said he was not willing to preside over people who are cannibals and claimed that leaving the house would keep him from overshadowing his successor85 postspeakershipedit gingrich has since remained involved in national politics

medication must be seen as preventive leading to reduced need for medical procedures86 in a may 15 2011 interview on meet the press gingrich repeated his longheld belief that all of us have a responsibility to pay—help pay for health care and suggested this could be implemented by either a mandate to obtain health insurance or a requirement to post a bond ensuring coverage8788 in the same interview gingrich said i dont think rightwing social engineering is any more desirable than leftwing social engineering i dont think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good
