financial regulation clawback v t e mergers and acquisitions ma are transactions in which the ownership of companies other business organizations or their operating units are transferred or combined as an aspect of strategic management ma can allow enterprises to grow shrink and change the nature of their business or competitive position from a legal point of view a merger is a legal consolidation of two entities into one entity whereas an acquisition occurs when one entity takes ownership of another entitys stock equity interests or assets from a commercial and economic point of view both types of transactions generally result in the consolidation of assets and liabilities under one entity and the distinction between a merger and an acquisition is less clear a transaction legally structured as an acquisition may have the effect of placing one partys business under the indirect ownership of the other partys shareholders while a transaction legally structured as a merger may give each partys shareholders partial ownership and control of the combined enterprise a deal may be euphemistically called a merger of equals if both ceos agree that joining together is in the best interest of both of their companies while when the deal is unfriendly that is when the management of the target company opposes the deal it may be regarded as an acquisition contents 1

purchase of one business or company by another company or other business entity1 specific acquisition targets can be identified through myriad avenues including market research trade expos or sent up from internal business units among others2 such purchase may be of 100 or nearly 100 of the assets or ownership equity of the acquired entity consolidation occurs when two companies combine to form a new enterprise altogether and neither of the previous companies remains independently acquisitions are divided into private and public acquisitions depending on whether the acquiree or merging company also termed a target is or is not listed on a public stock market some public companies rely on acquisitions as an important value creation strategy3 an additional dimension or categorization consists of whether an acquisition is friendly or hostile achieving acquisition success has proven to be very difficult while various studies have shown that 50 of acquisitions were unsuccessful4 serial acquirers appear to be more successful with ma than companies who only make an acquisition occasionally see douma schreuder 2013 chapter 135 the new forms of buy out created since the crisis are based on serial type acquisitions known as an eco buyout which is a cocommunity ownership buy out and the new generation buy outs of the mibo management involved or management institution buy out and meibo management employee involved buy out look up merger in wiktionary the free dictionary whether a purchase is perceived as being a friendly one or hostile depends significantly on how the proposed acquisition is communicated to and perceived by the target companys board of directors employees and shareholders it is normal for ma deal communications to take place in a socalled confidentiality bubble wherein the flow of information is restricted pursuant to confidentiality agreements6 in the case of a friendly transaction the companies cooperate in negotiations in the case of a hostile deal the board andor management of the target is unwilling to be bought or the targets board has no prior knowledge of the offer hostile acquisitions can and often do ultimately become friendly as the acquiror secures endorsement of the transaction from the board of the acquiree company this usually requires an improvement in the terms of the offer andor through negotiation acquisition usually refers to a purchase of a smaller firm by a larger one sometimes however a smaller firm will acquire management control of a larger andor longerestablished company and retain the name of the latter for the postacquisition combined entity this is known as a reverse takeover another type of acquisition is the reverse merger a form of transaction that enables a private company to be publicly listed in a relatively short time frame a reverse merger occurs when a privately held company often one that has strong prospects and is eager to raise financing buys a publicly listed shell company usually one with no business and limited assets the combined evidence suggests that the shareholders of acquired firms realize significant positive abnormal returns while shareholders of the acquiring company are most likely to experience a negative wealth effect7 the overall net effect of ma transactions appears to be positive almost all studies report positive returns for the investors in the combined buyer and target firms this implies that ma creates economic value presumably by transferring assets to management teams that operate them more efficiently see douma schreuder 2013 chapter 13 there are also a variety of structures used in securing control over the assets of a company which have different tax and regulatory implications this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed june 2008 learn how and when to remove this template message the buyer buys the shares and therefore control of the target company being purchased ownership control of the company in turn conveys effective control over the assets of the company but since the company is acquired intact as a going concern this form of transaction carries with it all of the liabilities accrued by that business over its past and all of the risks that company faces in its commercial environment the buyer buys the assets of the target company the cash the target receives from the selloff is paid back to its shareholders by dividend or through liquidation this type of transaction leaves the target company as an empty shell if the buyer buys out the entire assets a buyer often structures the transaction as an asset purchase to cherrypick the assets that it wants and leave out the assets and liabilities that it does not this can be particularly important where foreseeable liabilities may include future unquantified damage awards such as those that could arise from litigation over defective products employee benefits or terminations or environmental damage a disadvantage of this structure is the tax that many jurisdictions particularly outside the united states impose on transfers of the individual assets whereas stock transactions can frequently be structured as likekind exchanges or other arrangements that are taxfree or taxneutral both to the buyer and to the sellers shareholders the terms demerger spinoff and spinout are sometimes used to indicate a situation where one company splits into two generating a second company which may or may not become separately listed on a stock exchange as per knowledgebased views firms can generate greater values through the retention of knowledgebased resources which they generate and integrate8 extracting

and removed july 2012 learn how and when to remove this template message improper documentation and changing implicit knowledge makes it difficult to share information during acquisition for acquired firm symbolic and cultural independence which is the base of technology and capabilities are more important than administrative independence detailed knowledge exchange and integrations are difficult when the acquired firm is large and high performing management of executives from acquired firm is critical in terms of promotions and pay incentives to utilize their talent and value their expertise transfer of technologies and capabilities are most difficult task to manage because of complications of acquisition implementation the risk of losing implicit knowledge is always associated with the fast pace acquisition an increase in acquisitions in the global business environment requires enterprises to evaluate the key stake holders of acquisition very carefully before implementation it is imperative for the acquirer to understand this relationship and apply it to its advantage employee retention is only possible when resources are exchanged and managed without affecting their independence9 legal structuresedit corporate acquisitions can be characterized for legal purposes as either asset purchases in which the seller sells business assets to the buyer or equity purchases in which the buyer purchases equity interests in a target company from one or more selling shareholders asset purchases are common in technology transactions where the buyer is most interested in particular intellectual property rights but does not want to acquire liabilities or other contractual relationships10 an asset purchase structure may also be used when the buyer wishes to buy a particular division or unit of a company which is not a separate legal entity there are numerous challenges particular to this type of transaction including isolating the specific assets and liabilities that pertain to the unit determining whether the unit utilizes services from other units of the selling company transferring employees transferring permits and licenses and ensuring that the seller does not compete with the buyer in the same business area in the future11 structuring the sale of a financially distressed company is uniquely difficult due to the treatment of noncompete covenants consulting agreements and business goodwill in such transactions12 mergers asset purchases and equity purchases are each taxed differently and the most beneficial structure for tax purposes is highly situationdependent one hybrid form often employed for tax purposes is a triangular merger where the target company merges with a shell company wholly owned by the buyer thus becoming a subsidiary of the buyer in a forward triangular merger the buyer causes the target company to merge into the subsidiary a reverse triangular merger is similar except that the subsidiary merges into the target company under the us internal revenue code a forward triangular merger is taxed as if the target company sold its assets to the shell company and then liquidated whereas a reverse triangular merger is taxed as if the target companys shareholders sold their stock in the target company to the buyer13 documentationedit the documentation of an ma transaction often begins with a letter of intent the letter of intent generally does not bind the parties to commit to a transaction but may bind the parties to confidentiality and exclusivity obligations so that the transaction can be considered through a due diligence process involving lawyers accountants tax advisors and other professionals as well as business people from both sides11 after due diligence is completed the parties may proceed to draw up a definitive agreement known as a merger agreement share purchase agreement or asset purchase agreement depending on the structure of the transaction such contracts are typically 80 to 100 pages long and focus on five key types of terms14 conditions which must be satisfied before there is an obligation to complete the transaction conditions typically include matters such as regulatory approvals and the lack of any material adverse change in the targets business representations and warranties by the seller with regard to the company which are claimed to be true at both the time of signing and the time of closing sellers often attempt to craft their representations and warranties with knowledge qualifiers dictating the level of knowledge applicable and which seller parties knowledge is relevant15 some agreements provide that if the representations and warranties by the seller prove to be false the buyer may claim a refund of part of the purchase price as is common in transactions involving privately held companies although in most acquisition agreements involving public company targets the representations and warranties of the seller do not survive the closing representations regarding a target companys net working capital are a common source of postclosing disputes covenants which govern the conduct of the parties both before the closing such as covenants that restrict the operations of the business between signing and closing and after the closing such as covenants regarding future income tax filings and tax liability or postclosing restrictions agreed to by the buyer and seller parties termination rights which may be triggered by a breach of contract a failure to satisfy certain conditions or the passage of a certain period of time without consummating the transaction and fees and damages payable in case of a termination for certain events also known as breakup fees provisions relating to obtaining required shareholder approvals under state law and related sec filings required under federal law if applicable and terms related to the mechanics of the legal transactions to be consummated at closing such as the determination and allocation of the purchase price and postclosing adjustments such as adjustments after the final determination of working capital at closing or earnout payments payable to the sellers repayment of outstanding debt and the treatment of outstanding shares options and other equity interests an indemnification provision which provides that an indemnitor will indemnify defend and hold harmless the indemnitees for losses incurred by the indemnitees as a result of the indemnitors breach of its contractual obligations in the purchase agreement16 postclosing adjustments may still occur to certain provisions of the purchase agreement including the purchase price these adjustments are subject to enforceability issues in certain situations17 alternatively certain transactions use the locked box approach where the purchase price is fixed at signing and based on seller’s equity value at a presigning date and an interest charge18 business valuationedit the five most common ways to value a business are asset valuation historical earnings valuation future maintainable earnings valuation relative valuation comparable company and comparable transactions discounted cash flow dcf valuation professionals who value businesses generally do not use just one of these methods but a combination of some of them as well as possibly others that are not mentioned above in order to obtain a more accurate value the information in the balance sheet or income statement is obtained by one of three accounting measures a notice to reader a review engagement or an audit accurate business valuation is one of the most important aspects of ma as valuations like these will have a major effect on the price that a business will be sold for most often this information is expressed in a letter of opinion of value lov when the business is being valuated for interests sake there are other more detailed ways of expressing the value of a business while these reports generally get more detailed and expensive as the size of a company increases this is not always the case as there are many complicated industries which require more attention to detail regardless of size objectively evaluating the historical and prospective performance of a business is a challenge faced by many generally parties rely on independent third parties to conduct due diligence studies or business assessments to yield the most value from a business assessment objectives should be clearly defined and the right resources should be chosen to conduct the assessment in the available timeframe19 as synergy plays a large role in the valuation of acquisitions it is paramount to get the value of synergies right synergies are different from the sales price valuation of the firm as they will accrue to the buyer hence the analysis should be done from the acquiring firms point of view synergycreating investments are started by the choice of the acquirer and therefore they are not obligatory making them essentially real options to include this real options aspect into analysis of acquisition targets is one interesting issue that has been studied lately20 financingedit

differentiated from acquisitions partly by the way in which they are financed and partly by the relative size of the companies various methods of financing an ma deal exist cashedit payment by cash such transactions are usually termed acquisitions rather than mergers because the shareholders of the target company are removed from the picture and the target comes under the indirect control of the bidders shareholders stockedit payment in the form of the acquiring companys stock issued to the shareholders of the acquired company at a given ratio proportional to the valuation of the latter they receive stock in the company that is purchasing the smaller subsidiary financing optionsedit there are some elements to think about when choosing the form of payment when submitting an offer the acquiring firm should consider other potential bidders and think strategically the form of payment might be decisive for the seller with pure cash deals there is no doubt on the real value of the bid without considering an eventual earnout the contingency of the share payment is indeed removed thus a cash offer preempts competitors better than securities taxes are a second element to consider and should be evaluated with the counsel of competent tax and accounting advisers third with a share deal the buyer’s capital structure might be affected and the control of the buyer modified if the issuance of shares is necessary shareholders of the acquiring company might prevent such capital increase at the general meeting of shareholders the risk is removed with a cash transaction then the balance sheet of the buyer will be modified and the decision maker should take into account the effects on the reported financial results for example in a pure cash deal financed from the company’s current account liquidity ratios might decrease on the other hand in a pure stock for stock transaction financed from the issuance of new shares the company might show lower profitability ratios eg roa however economic dilution must prevail towards accounting dilution when making the choice the form of payment and financing options are tightly linked if the buyer pays cash there are three main financing options cash on hand it consumes financial slack excess cash or unused debt capacity and may decrease debt rating there are no major transaction costs issue of debt it consumes financial slack may decrease debt rating and increase cost of debt transaction costs include underwriting or closing costs of 1 to 3 of the face value issue of stock it increases financial slack may improve debt rating and reduce cost of debt transaction costs include fees for preparation of a proxy statement an extraordinary shareholder meeting and registration if the buyer pays with stock the financing possibilities are issue of stock same effects and transaction costs as described above shares in treasury it increases financial slack if they don’t have to be repurchased on the market may improve debt rating and reduce cost of debt transaction costs include brokerage fees if shares are repurchased in the market otherwise there are no major costs in general stock will create financial flexibility transaction costs must also be considered but tend to affect the payment decision more for larger transactions finally paying cash or with shares is a way to signal value to the other party eg buyers tend to offer stock when they believe their shares are overvalued and cash when undervalued parties should also consider their accounting treatment of ma transaction costs and ensure they comply with department of treasury regulations including the applicability of the end of the day and next day rules21 specialist advisory firmsedit ma advice is provided by fullservice investment banks who often advise and handle the biggest deals in the world called bulge bracket and specialist ma firms who only provide ma advisory generally to midmarket select industries and sbes motivationedit improving financial performance or reducing riskedit the dominant rationale used to explain ma activity is that acquiring firms seek improved financial performance or reduce risk the following motives are considered to improve financial performance or reduce risk economy of scale this refers to the fact that the combined company can often reduce its fixed costs by removing duplicate departments or operations lowering the costs of the company relative to the same revenue stream thus increasing profit margins economy of scope this refers to the efficiencies primarily associated with demandside changes such as increasing or decreasing the scope of marketing and distribution of different types of products increased revenue or market share this assumes that the buyer will be absorbing a major competitor and thus increase its market power by capturing increased market share to set prices crossselling for example a bank buying a stock broker could then sell its banking products to the stock brokers customers while the broker can sign up the banks customers for brokerage accounts or a manufacturer can acquire and sell complementary products synergy for example managerial economies such as the increased opportunity of managerial specialization another example is purchasing economies due to increased order size and associated bulkbuying discounts taxation a profitable company can buy a loss maker to use the targets loss as their advantage by reducing their tax liability in the united states and many other countries rules are in place to limit the ability of profitable companies to shop for loss making companies limiting the tax motive of an acquiring company geographical or other diversification this is designed to smooth the earnings results of a company which over the long term smoothens the stock price of a company giving conservative investors more confidence in investing in the company however this does not always deliver value to shareholders see below resource transfer resources are unevenly distributed across firms barney 1991 and the interaction of target and acquiring firm resources can create value through either overcoming information asymmetry or by combining scarce resources22 vertical integration vertical integration occurs when an upstream and downstream firm merge or one acquires the other there are several reasons for this to occur one reason is to internalise an externality problem a common example of such an externality is double marginalization double marginalization occurs when both the upstream and downstream firms have monopoly power and each firm reduces output from the competitive level to the monopoly level creating two deadweight losses following a merger the vertically integrated firm can collect one deadweight loss by setting the downstream firms output to the competitive level this increases profits and consumer surplus a merger that creates a vertically integrated firm can be profitable23 hiring some companies use acquisitions as an alternative to the normal hiring process this is especially common when the target is a small private company or is in the startup phase in this case the acquiring company simply hires acquhires the staff of the target private company thereby acquiring its talent if that is its main asset and appeal the target private company simply dissolves and few legal issues are involvedcitation needed absorption of similar businesses under single management similar portfolio invested by two different mutual funds namely united money market fund and united growth and income fund caused the management to absorb united money market fund into united growth and income fund access to hidden or nonperforming assets land real estate acquire innovative intellectual property24 megadeals—deals of at least one 1 billion in size—tend to fall into four discrete categories consolidation capabilities extension technologydriven market transformation and going private25 other typesedit however on average and across the most commonly studied variables acquiring firms financial performance does not positively change as a function of their acquisition activity26 therefore additional motives for merger and acquisition that may not add shareholder value include diversification while this may hedge a company against a downturn in an individual industry it fails to deliver value since it is possible for individual shareholders to achieve the same hedge by diversifying their portfolios at a much lower cost than those associated with a merger in his book one up on wall street peter lynch termed this diworseification managers hubris managers overconfidence about expected synergies from ma which results in overpayment for the target company empirebuilding managers have larger companies to manage and hence more power managers compensation in the past certain executive management teams had their payout based on the total amount of profit of the company instead of the profit per share which would give the team a perverse incentive to buy companies to increase the total profit while decreasing the profit per share which hurts the owners of the company the shareholders different typesedit by functional roles in marketedit the ma process itself is a multifaceted which depends upon the type of merging companies a horizontal merger is usually between two companies in the same business sector an example of horizontal merger would be if a video game publisher purchases another video game publisher for instance square enix acquiring eidos interactive27 this means that synergy can be obtained through many forms such as increased market share cost savings and exploring new market opportunities a vertical merger represents the buying of supplier of a business in a similar example if a video game publisher purchases a video game development company in order to retain the development studios intellectual properties for instance kadokawa corporation acquiring fromsoftware28 the vertical buying is aimed at reducing overhead cost of operations and economy of scale conglomerate ma is the third form of ma process which deals the merger between two irrelevant companies the relevant example of conglomerate ma would be if a video game publisher purchases an animation studio for instance when sega sammy holdings subsidized tms entertainment29 the objective may be diversification of goods and services and capital investment by business outcomeedit the ma process results in the restructing of a business purpose corporate governance and brand identity a statutory merger is a merger in which the acquiring company survives and the target company dissolves the purpose of this merger is to transfer the assets and capital of the target company into the acquiring company without having to maintain the target company as a subsidiary30 a consolidated merger is a merger in which an entirely new legal company is formed through combining the acquiring and target company the purpose of this merger is to create a new legal entity with the capital and assets of the merged acquirer and target company both the acquiring and target company are dissolved in the process31 arms length mergersedit an arms length merger is a merger approved by disinterested directors and approved by disinterested stockholders ″the two elements are complementary and not substitutes the first element is important because the directors have the capability to act as effective and active bargaining agents which disaggregated stockholders do not but because bargaining agents are not always effective or faithful the second element is critical because it gives the minority stockholders the opportunity to reject their agents work therefore when a merger with a controlling stockholder was 1 negotiated and approved by a special committee of independent directors and 2 conditioned on an affirmative vote of a majority of the minority stockholders the business judgment standard of review should presumptively apply and any plaintiff ought to have to plead particularized facts that if true support an inference that despite the facially fair process the merger was tainted because of fiduciary wrongdoing″32 strategic mergersedit a strategic merger usually refers to long term strategic holding of target acquired firm this type of ma process aims at creating synergies in the long run by increased market share broad customer base and corporate strength of business a strategic acquirer may also be willing to pay a premium offer to target firm in the outlook of the synergy value created after ma process acquihireedit the term acquihire is used to refer to acquisitions where the acquiring company seeks to obtain the target companys talent rather than their products which are often discontinued as part of the acquisition so the team can focus on projects for their new employer in recent years these types of acquisitions have become common in the technology industry where major web companies such as facebook twitter and yahoo have frequently used talent acquisitions to add expertise in particular areas to their workforces3334 merger of equalsedit merger of equals is often a combination of companies of a similar size since 1991 there have been more than 600 ma transactions announced as mergers of equals with a total value of usd 2126 bil35 some of the largest mergers of equals took place during the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and in the year 2000 aol and timewarner usd 164 bil smithkline beecham and glaxo wellcome usd 75 bil citicorp and travelers group usd 72 bil more recent examples this type of combinations are dupont and dow chemical usd 62 bil and praxair and linde usd 35 bil research and statistics for acquired organizationsedit an analysis of 1600 companies across industries revealed the rewards for ma activity were greater for consumer products companies than the average company for the period 20002010 consumer products companies turned in an average annual tsr of 74 while the average for all companies was 4836 given that the cost of replacing an executive can run over 100 of his or her annual salary any investment of time and energy in rerecruitment will likely pay for itself many times over if it helps a business retain just a handful of key players that would have otherwise left organizations should move rapidly to rerecruit key managers it’s much easier to succeed with a team of quality players that one selects deliberately rather than try to win a game with those who randomly show up to play brand considerationsedit mergers and acquisitions often create brand problems beginning with what to call the company after the transaction and going down into detail about what to do about overlapping and competing product brands decisions about what brand equity to write off are not inconsequential and given the ability for the right brand choices to drive preference and earn a price premium the future success of a merger or acquisition depends on making wise brand choices brand decisionmakers essentially can choose from four different approaches to dealing with naming issues each with specific pros and cons37 keep one name and discontinue the other the strongest legacy brand with the best prospects for the future lives on in the merger of united airlines and continental airlines the united brand will continue forward while continental is retired keep one name and demote the other the strongest name becomes the company name and the weaker one is demoted to a divisional brand or product brand an example is caterpillar inc keeping the bucyrus international name38 keep both names and use them together some companies try to please everyone and keep the value of both brands by using them together this can create an unwieldy name as in the case of pricewaterhousecoopers which has since changed its brand name to pwc discard both legacy names and adopt a totally new one the classic example is the merger of bell atlantic with gte which became verizon communications not every merger with a new name is successful by consolidating into yrc worldwide the company lost the considerable value of both yellow freight and roadway corp the factors influencing brand decisions in a merger or acquisition transaction can range from political to tactical ego can drive choice just as well as rational factors such as brand value and costs involved with changing brands38 beyond the bigger issue of what to call the company after the transaction comes the ongoing detailed choices about what divisional product and service brands to keep the detailed decisions about the brand portfolio are covered under the topic brand architecture historyedit most histories of ma begin in the late 19th century united states however mergers coincide historically with the existence of companies in 1708 for example the east india company merged with an erstwhile competitor to restore its monopoly over the indian trade in 1784 the italian monte dei paschi and monte pio banks were united as the monti reuniti39 in 1821 the hudsons bay company merged with the rival north west company the great merger movement 1895–1905edit the great merger movement was a predominantly us business phenomenon that happened from 1895 to 1905 during this time small firms with little market share consolidated with similar firms to form large powerful institutions that dominated their markets it is estimated that more than 1800 of these firms disappeared into consolidations many of which acquired substantial shares of the markets in which they operated the vehicle used were socalled trusts in 1900 the value of firms acquired in mergers was 20 of gdp in 1990 the value was only 3 and from 1998 to 2000 it was around 10–11 of gdp companies such as dupont us steel and general electric that merged during the great merger movement were able to keep their dominance in their respective sectors through 1929 and in some cases today due to growing technological advances of their products patents and brand recognition by their customers there were also other companies that held the greatest market share in 1905 but at the same time did not have the competitive advantages of the companies like dupont and general electric these companies such as international paper and american chicle saw their market share decrease significantly by 1929 as smaller competitors joined forces with each other and provided much more competition the companies that merged were mass producers of homogeneous goods that could exploit the efficiencies of large volume production in addition many of these mergers were capitalintensive due to high fixed costs when demand fell these newly merged companies had an incentive to maintain output and reduce prices however more often than not mergers were quick mergers these quick mergers involved mergers of companies with unrelated technology and different management as a result the efficiency gains associated with mergers were not present the new and bigger company would actually face higher costs than competitors because of these technological and managerial differences thus the mergers were not done to see large efficiency gains they were in fact done because that was the trend at the time companies which had specific fine products like fine writing paper earned their profits on high margin rather than volume and took no part in the great merger movementcitation needed shortrun factorsedit one of the major short run factors that sparked the great merger movement was the desire to keep prices high however high prices attracted the entry of new firms into the industry a major catalyst behind the great merger movement was the panic of 1893 which led to a major decline in demand for many homogeneous goods for producers of homogeneous goods when demand falls these producers have more of an incentive to maintain output and cut prices in order to spread out the high fixed costs these producers faced ie lowering cost per unit and the desire to exploit efficiencies of maximum volume production however during the panic of 1893 the fall in demand led to a steep fall in prices another economic model proposed by naomi r lamoreaux for explaining the steep price falls is to view the involved firms acting as monopolies in their respective markets as quasimonopolists firms set quantity where marginal cost equals marginal revenue and price where this quantity intersects demand when the panic of 1893 hit demand fell and along with demand the firm’s marginal revenue fell as well given high fixed costs the new price was below average total cost resulting in a loss however also being in a high fixed costs industry these costs can be spread out through greater production ie higher quantity produced to return to the quasimonopoly model in order for a firm to earn profit firms would steal part of another firm’s market share by dropping their price slightly and producing to the point where higher quantity and lower price exceeded their average total cost as other firms joined this practice prices began falling everywhere and a price war ensued40 one strategy to keep prices high and to maintain profitability was for producers of the same good to collude with each other and form associations also known as cartels these cartels were thus able to raise prices right away sometimes more than doubling prices however these prices set by cartels only provided a shortterm solution because cartel members would cheat on each other by setting a lower price than the price set by the cartel also the high price set by the cartel would encourage new firms to enter the industry and offer competitive pricing causing prices to fall once again as a result these cartels did not succeed in maintaining high prices for a period of more than a few years the most viable solution to this problem was for firms to merge through horizontal integration with other top firms in the market in order to control a large market share and thus successfully set a higher pricecitation needed longrun factorsedit in the long run due to desire to keep costs low it was advantageous for firms to merge and reduce their transportation costs thus producing and transporting from one location rather than various sites of different companies as in the past low transport costs coupled with economies of scale also increased firm size by two to fourfold during the second half of the nineteenth century in addition technological changes prior to the merger movement within companies increased the efficient size of plants with capital intensive assembly lines allowing for economies of scale thus improved technology and transportation were forerunners to the great merger movement in part due to competitors as mentioned above and in part due to the government however many of these initially successful mergers were eventually dismantled the us government passed the sherman act in 1890 setting rules against price fixing and monopolies starting in the 1890s with such cases as addyston pipe and steel company v united states the courts attacked large companies for strategizing with others or within their own companies to maximize profits price fixing with competitors created a greater incentive for companies to unite and merge under one name so that they were not competitors anymore and technically not price fixing the economic history has been divided into merger waves based on the merger activities in the business world as period name facet 41 1893–1904 first wave horizontal mergers 1919–1929 second wave vertical mergers 1955–1970 third wave diversified conglomerate mergers 1974–1989 fourth wave cogeneric mergers hostile takeovers corporate raiding 1993–2000 fifth wave crossborder mergers megamergers 2003–2008 sixth wave globalisation shareholder activism private equity lbo 2014 seventh wave objectives in more recent merger wavesedit during the third merger wave 1965–1989 corporate marriages involved more diverse companies acquirers more frequently bought into different industries sometimes this was done to smooth out cyclical bumps to diversify the hope being that it would hedge an investment portfolio starting in the fifth merger wave 1992–1998 and continuing today companies are more likely to acquire in the same business or close to it firms that complement and strengthen an acquirer’s capacity to serve customers buyers aren’t necessarily hungry for the target companies’ hard assets some are more interested in acquiring thoughts methodologies people and relationships paul graham recognized this in his 2005 essay hiring is obsolete in which he theorizes that the free market is better at identifying talent and that traditional hiring practices do not follow the principles of free market because they depend a lot upon credentials and university degrees graham was probably the first to identify the trend in which large companies such as google yahoo or microsoft were choosing to acquire startups instead of hiring new recruits42 a process known as acquihiring many companies are being bought for their patents licenses market share name brand research staff methods customer base or culture soft capital like this is very perishable fragile and fluid integrating it usually takes more finesse and expertise than integrating machinery real estate inventory and other tangibles crossborderedit introductionedit in a study conducted in 2000 by lehman brothers it was found that on average large ma deals cause the domestic currency of the target corporation to appreciate by 1 relative to the acquirers local currency the rise of globalization has exponentially increased the necessity for agencies such as the mergers and acquisitions international clearing maic trust accounts and securities clearing services for likekind exchanges for crossborder macitation needed in 1997 alone there were over 2333 crossborder transactions worth a total of approximately 298 billion the vast literature on empirical studies over value creation in crossborder ma is not conclusive but points to higher returns in crossborder mas compared to domestic ones when the acquirer firm has the capability to exploit resources and knowledge of the targets firm and of handling challenges in china for example securing regulatory approval can be complex due to an extensive group of various stakeholders at each level of government43 in the united kingdom acquirers may face pension regulators with significant powers44 in addition to an overall ma environment that is generally more sellerfriendly than the us45 nonetheless the current surge in global crossborder ma has been called the new era of global economic discovery46 in little more than a decade ma deals in china increased by a factor of 20 from 69 in 2000 to more than 1300 in 201347 in 2014 europe registered its highest levels of ma deal activity since the financial crisis driven by us and asian acquirers inbound ma at 3206 billion reached record highs by both deal value and deal count since 200148 approximately 23 percent of the 416 ma deals announced in the us ma market in 2014 involved nonus acquirers49 for 2016 market uncertainties including brexit and the potential reform from a us presidential election contributed to crossborder ma activity lagging roughly 20 behind 2015 activity50 even mergers of companies with headquarters in the same country can often be considered international in scale and require maic custodial services for example when boeing acquired mcdonnell douglas the two american companies had to integrate operations in dozens of countries around the world 1997 this is just as true for other apparently singlecountry mergers such as the 29 billiondollar merger of swiss drug makers sandoz and cibageigy now novartis in emerging countriesedit ma practice in emerging countries differs from more mature economies although transaction management and valuation tools eg dcf comparables share a common basic methodology in china india or brazil for example differences affect the formation of asset price and on the structuring of deals profitability expectations eg shorter time horizon no terminal value due to low visibility and risk represented by a discount rate must both be properly adjusted51 in a ma perspective differences between emerging and more mature economies include i a less developed system of property rights ii less reliable financial information iii cultural differences in negotiations and iv a higher degree of competition for the best targets property rights52 the capacity to transfer property rights and legally enforce the protection of such rights after payment may be questionable property transfer through the stock purchase agreement can be imperfect eg no real warranties and even reversible eg one of the multiple administrative authorizations needed not granted after closing leading to situations where costly remedial actions may be necessary when the rule of law is not established corruption can be a rampant problem information53 documentation delivered to a buyer may be scarce with a limited level of reliability as an example double sets of accounting are common practice and blur the capacity to form a correct judgment running valuation on such basis bears the risk to lead to erroneous conclusions therefore building a reliable knowledge base on observable facts and on the result of focused due diligences such as recurring profitability measured by ebitda is a good starting point negotiation54 “yes” may not be synonym that the parties have reached an agreement getting immediately to the point may not be considered appropriate in some cultures and even considered rude the negotiations may continue to the last minute sometimes even after the deal has been officially closed if the seller keeps some leverage like a minority stake in the divested entity therefore establishing a strong local business network before starting acquisitions is usually a prerequisite to get to know trustable parties to deal with and have allies competition the race to acquire the best companies in an emerging economy can generate a high degree of competition and inflate transaction prices as a consequence of limited available targets this may push for poor management decisions before investment time is always needed to build a reliable set of information on the competitive landscape if not properly dealt with these factors will likely have adverse consequences on returnoninvestment roi and create difficulties in daytoday business operations it is advisable that ma tools designed for mature economies are not directly used in emerging markets without some adjustment ma teams need time to adapt and understand the key operating differences between their home environment and their new market failureedit despite the goal of performance improvement results from mergers and acquisitions ma are often disappointing compared with results predicted or expected numerous empirical studies show high failure rates of ma deals studies are mostly focused on individual determinants a book by thomas straub 2007 reasons for frequent failure in mergers and acquisitions55 develops a comprehensive research framework that bridges different perspectives and promotes an understanding of factors underlying ma performance in business research and scholarship the study should help managers in the decision making process the first important step towards this objective is the development of a common frame of reference that spans conflicting theoretical assumptions from different perspectives on this basis a comprehensive framework is proposed with which to understand the origins of ma performance better and address the problem of fragmentation by integrating the most important competing perspectives in respect of studies on ma furthermore according to the existing literature relevant determinants of firm performance are derived from each dimension of the model for the dimension strategic management the six strategic variables market similarity market complementarities production operation similarity production operation complementarities market power and purchasing power were identified as having an important effect on ma performance for the dimension organizational behavior the variables acquisition experience relative size and cultural differences were found to be important finally relevant determinants of ma performance from the financial field were acquisition premium bidding process and due diligence three different ways in order to best measure post ma performance are recognized synergy realization absolute performance and finally relative performance employee turnover contributes to ma failures the turnover in target companies is double the turnover experienced in nonmerged
