in chinook jargon as tenass chuck little water as against lake washington hyas chuck big water it is similarly known in duwamish as meman hartshu little lake when white pioneers arrived in the 1850s native americans—probably duwamish or southern coast salish—were encamped near the southwest corner of the lake and along a stream near the presentday corner of 8th and thomas another stream ran near boren street there was a trail from the south end of the lake to elliott bay at the time there were deer and elk in the area natives also ate fish clams root vegetables camas bracken wapato and berries significant native settlement in south lake union lasted until 1875 when a windstorm knocked over a tree destroying a longhouse in what is now cascade5 pioneer david denny of the denny party staked a claim in 1853 dennys claim ran from south lake union where the lake extended farther to the south and west than it does today south to what is now denny way and west to include the area that is now the seattle center grounds5 in 1882 the lake union and lumber company established a sawmill the citys largest6 on the south shore of the lake near what is now the corner of mercer and westlake denny bought it in 1884 renaming it the western mill he cleared the land along the south shore of the lake and in 1885 cut a weir from portage bay at the northeast corner of the lake to lake washington which allowed logs to be floated to lake union so that the entire area of the larger lake washington was a catchment for his mill78 denny operated the western mill until 1895 and many of his employees settled nearby some with families during this time other mills opened in the area in addition the lake became a link in the transport of coal which came from near issaquah via lake washington wagon to portage bay and thence to lake union at first coal was transported from south lake union to the downtown docks by wagon then from 1872 to about 1877 on a narrowgauge railroad that followed the route of presentday westlake avenue to pike street the railroad however was abandoned and the route degenerated back to a wagon trail7 20th centuryedit south lake union with lake union park in the center and i5 and eastlake in the background as seen from the space needle looking north on terry avenue n to lake union 2007 after david dennys bankruptcy 18956 this mill operated until the 1920s under new ownership of brace hergert mill company in 1909 brace hergert extended their mill into the lake building a peninsula now known as lake union park the last remaining portion of the mill business was brace lumber company which operated from 1925 to 1988 the end of the mill era the area also saw a growth in manufacturing toward the turn of the century cabinetry and furniture led the way in the 1890s9 followed by shipbuilding bill boeings first airplane factory manufacturing seaplanes10 and in cascade seattle city lights hydro house 1912 and lake union steam plant 1914 and the first ford model t assembly plant west of the mississippi river 191411 both of these buildings now have landmark status12 the former steam plant now houses zymogenetics13 and the former ford building is used for rental storage space14 meanwhile the northern pacific railway ran a railroad line around lake union and down terry avenue where a freight station opened in 191311 with industrial and commercial growth more residential centers sprang up to house company employees and other residents preeminent among these residential centers was cascade at the center of the community established by the russians swedes norwegians and greeks who settled there in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was the cascade school built 1894 demolished after the 1949 olympia earthquake a public elementary school from which the neighborhood took its name from the 1930s south lake union became less residential evolving into an area of small business warehouses and autooriented services cascade slowly lost its identity as a neighborhood distinct from the rest of south lake union especially after construction of interstate 5 cut it off from capitol hill15 when the lake washington ship canal opened in 1917 the locks at ballard kept lake union at its historic level while the canal gave it a water connection both to lake washington and to puget sound an arm of the pacific ocean this was a further boon to industrial and commercial development many timberframed buildings survive from this era with masonry exterior walls of brick or for some commercial buildings terracotta for a time the cascade neighborhood held numerous automobile dealerships the surviving ford mckay and pacific mckay buildings are examples most of the citys large laundries were in the area especially in cascade although the large surviving troy laundry building 1927 is immediately west of fairview avenue e16 these were soon joined by the seattle times building 193016 in the early 1990s seattle times columnist john hinterberger proposed redeveloping the area into a large green space something like new yorks central park loosely based on parts of virgil bogues 1911 bogue plan this plan became known as the seattle commons and evolved to include mixedincome housing retail and commercial space on the park edges17 microsoft cofounder paul allen donated 20m to buy property for the seattle commons which reverted to his ownership after the proposal was defeated by public votes in 1995 and 199618 21st centuryedit south lake union and downtown seattle as seen from lake union park amazoncom headquarters building in
