the crazed fans stealth elements are used with an onscreen map similar to that used in metal gear 2 solid snake the next level has similar gameplay riding the motorcycle collecting tokens the

upright arcade system sega system 18 display standard horizontal raster graphics different from the home computer version michael jacksons moonwalker マイケル・ジャクソンズ・ムーンウォーカー maikeru jakusonzu mūnwōkā is an arcade video game by sega programming and triumph international audiovisuals with the help of jackson which was released on the sega system 18 hardware this game suffered from segas suicide battery2 on its arcade board a battery that accidentally or otherwise renders the game unplayable at the end of its lifespan the arcade has distinctively different gameplay from its computer and console counterparts focusing more on beat em up gameplay elements rather than platform arcade gameplayedit the game is essentially a beatemup although jackson attacks with magic powers instead of physical contact and has the ability to shoot magic power at enemies instead of getting close enough for a melee attack a map of the stage is shown before it begins and after which jackson must get from the start to the end without losing all his health while rescuing all the children and defeating all the enemies along the way screenshot of michael jacksons moonwalker arcade game if the cabinet supports it up to three people can play simultaneously all three players play as jackson dressed in his suit from the smooth criminal music video the first player wears a white suit and hat with a blue shirt the second players character dons a scarlet outfit with a white shirt the third players character is dressed in black with a red shirt the characters all have armbands blue for white outfit white for red outfit and red for black outfit jacksons special attack is termed dance magic remaining stocks of this are displayed onscreen as the mj logo which had recently debuted in the film once activated a heavenly spotlight shines on jackson and jackson starts to dance several of his hallmark moves all of the onscreen enemies start dancing with jackson and are destroyed at the end of the dance routine ostensibly because they cannot keep up with jacksons dance moves bosses do not dance but do take a significant amount of damage there are three different dance routines that may be performed and the player starts with one to three of these attacks per credit depending on how the machine is set up bubbles the chimpanzee michaels reallife pet appears in each level once collected or rescued the chimp transforms michael into a robotic version of the pop singer that has the ability to shoot laser bursts and absorb significantly more damage the games soundtrack includes smooth

video game systems though the gameplay was completely different from the arcade version a version was also rated by pegi for release on virtual console3 but it never materialized and it was never specified which version was considered for rerelease the home console versions were actually based on an evolved version of the home computer version of the game with gameplay somewhat similar to the shinobi series in contrast to the arcade version which was a threequarters view shooterfighter type game the game involves the player controlling the pop star in a quest to save all the kids that have been kidnapped by mr big the games levels and music were borrowed from the film though many of the music tracks were taken from jacksons thriller album as well and the player has the ability to destroy enemies by making them dance jackson can become a robot by rescuing a certain child and then grabbing a comet that falls from the sky home console gameplayedit the gameplay is focused on finding children all of whom resemble katie from the movie which are scattered throughout the level some behind objects such as doors most of the objects are empty or contain enemies jacksons standard attack is a stylized high kick that is commonly incorporated into his dance routines if the player continues to hold the kick button and moves jackson backwards he performs his moonwalk dance move jackson has a combined healthability bar he can spin being invulnerable in the process however this spin move slowly drains health if the spin is held for more than two seconds jackson throws his hat in boomerang fashion which will destroy most enemies the longer the spin move is held the wider distance that the fedora will cover if held down long enough a dance magic scene similar to the arcade version plays featuring dance moves taken from the film clips of whatever song is playing in the background michael can also use the magic to slide down banisters and eliminate multiple enemies in the process in certain levels a shooting star may appear which temporarily transforms michael into a cyborg that can attack enemies with various artillery but cannot collect children almost every stage has three levels the final level of the mega drivegenesis version is a first person flight sim type battle between jackson now transformed into a space ship and mr bigs ship receptionedit reception
