critics william ruhlmann a writer for allmusic stated that watching the videos in order made him experience jacksons changing appearance over the year noting things such as jacksons skin becoming lighter a result of his vitiligo8 ruhlmann commented that seeing jacksons changing appearance as well as the videos itself helped him understand jacksons career more commenting number ones was released at what appeared to be the end of michael jacksons long troubled reign as a pop star and it contained many clues to both his success and his downfall8 ruhlmann further noted that a messianic theme ran through many of the videos like the relatively modest beat it which is about stopping violence to earth song in which jackson restored ravaged rain forests and even brought the dead back to life8 dan leluca of the philadelphia inquirer described number ones as being a reminder of the mtv era21 jeff mires of news pop music critic felt that the release of both the number ones cd and dvd
