cuba in 1961 canada–cuba trade tripled the globedemocrat published a rewrite of buchanans columbia masters project under the eightcolumn banner canada sells to red cuba — and prospers eight weeks after buchanan started at the paper according to buchanans memoir right from the beginning this article was a career milestone buchanan later said the embargo strengthened the communist regime and he turned against it12 buchanan was promoted to assistant editorial page editor in 1964 and supported barry goldwaters presidential campaign the globedemocrat did not endorse goldwater and buchanan speculated there was a clandestine agreement between the paper and president lyndon b johnson buchanan recalled the conservative movement has always advanced from its defeats i cant think of a single

speeches aimed at dedicated supporters he was soon nicknamed mr inside14 buchanan traveled with richard nixon throughout the campaigns of 1966 and 1968 he made a tour of western europe africa and in the immediate aftermath of the sixday war the middle east when nixon took the oval office in 1969 buchanan worked as a white house adviser and speechwriter for nixon and vice president spiro agnew buchanan coined the phrase silent majority and helped shape the strategy that drew millions of democrats to nixon in a 1972 memo he suggested the white house should move to recapture the antiestablishment tradition or theme in american politics15 his daily assignments included developing political strategy publishing the presidents daily news summary and preparing briefing books for news conferences he accompanied nixon on his trip to china in 1972 and the summit in moscow yalta and minsk in 1974 he suggested that nixon label democratic opponent george mcgovern an extremist and burn the white house tapes14 buchanan remained as a special assistant to nixon through the final days of the watergate scandal he was not accused of wrongdoing though some mistakenly suspected him of being deep throat in 2005 when the actual identity of the press leak was revealed as federal bureau of investigation associate director mark felt buchanan called him sneaky dishonest and criminal16 because of his role in the nixon campaigns attack group buchanan appeared before the senate watergate committee on september 26 1973 he told the panel the mandate that the american people gave to this president and his administration cannot and will not be frustrated or repealed or overthrown as a consequence of the incumbent tragedy14 when nixon resigned in 1974 buchanan briefly stayed on as special assistant under incoming president gerald ford chief of staff alexander haig approved buchanans appointment as ambassador to south africa but ford refused it14 buchanan remarked about watergate the lost opportunity to move against the political forces frustrating the expressed national will to effect a political counterrevolution in the capital — there is no substitute for a principled and dedicated man of the right in the oval office14 long after his resignation nixon called buchanan a confidant and said he was neither a racist nor an antisemite nor a bigot or hater but a decent patriotic american nixon said buchanan had some strong views such as his isolationist foreign policy with which he disagreed while nixon did not think buchanan should become president he said the commentator should be heard1718 news commentatoredit buchanan returned to his column and began regular appearances as a broadcast host and political commentator he cohosted a threehour daily radio show with liberal columnist tom braden called the buchananbraden program he delivered daily commentaries on nbc radio from 1978 to 1984 buchanan started his tv career as a regular on the mclaughlin group and cnns crossfire inspired by buchananbraden and the capital gang making him nationally recognizable his several stints on crossfire occurred between 1982 and 1999 his sparring partners included braden michael kinsley geraldine ferraro and bill press buchanan was a regular panelist on the mclaughlin group he appeared most sundays alongside john mclaughlin and the more liberal newsweek journalist eleanor clift his columns are syndicated nationally by creators syndicate19 work for the reagan white houseedit buchanan served as white house communications director from february 1985 to march 198720 in a speech to the national religious broadcasters in 1986 buchanan said about the reagan revolution whether president reagan has charted a new course that will set our compass for decades—or whether history will see him as the conservative interruption in a process of inexorable national decline—is yet to be determined14 a year later he remarked that the greatest vacuum in american politics is to the right of ronald reagan14 while her brother was working for reagan bay buchanan started a buchanan for president movement in june 1986 she said the conservative movement needed a leader but buchanan was initially ambivalent14 after leaving the white house he returned to his column and crossfire out of respect for jack kemp he sat out the 1988 race although kemp later became his adversary15 charges of antisemitism and holocaust denialedit buchanan wrote that it was impossible for 850000 jews to be killed by diesel exhaust fed into the gas chamber at treblinka in a column for the new york post in 199021 buchanan once argued treblinka was not a death camp but a transit camp used as a passthrough point for prisoners in fact some 900000 jews had died at treblinka22 when george will challenged him about it on tv buchanan did not reply in 1991 william f buckley jr wrote a 40000word national review article discussing antisemitism among conservative commentators focused largely on buchanan the article and many responses to it were collected in the book in search of antisemitism 1992 he concluded i find it impossible to defend pat buchanan against the charge that what he did and said during the period under examination amounted to antisemitism2324 the antidefamation league has called buchanan an unrepentant bigot who repeatedly demonizes jews and minorities and openly affiliates with white supremacists25 theres no doubt said pulitzer prizewinning columnist charles krauthammer he makes subliminal appeals to prejudice26 buchanan denies that he is antisemitic and a number of his journalistic colleagues including murray rothbard272829 justin raimondo30 jack germond al hunt and mark shields have defended him against the charge31 as a member of the reagan white house he is accused of having suppressed the reagan justice departments investigation into nazi scientists brought to america by the osss operation paperclip32 in the context of the gulf war on september 15 1990 buchanan appeared on the mclaughlin group and said that there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the middle east – the israeli defense ministry and its amen corner in the united states he also said the israelis want this war desperately because they want the united states to destroy the iraqi war machine they want us to finish them off they dont care about our relations with the arab world33 furthermore on the mclaughlin group buchanan has also made such comments as “‘capitol hill is israeli occupied territory’ and ‘if you want to know ethnicity and power in the united states senate 13 members of the senate are jewish folks who are from 2 percent of the population that is where real power is at…’”34 buchanan supported president reagans plan to visit a german military cemetery at bitburg in 1985 where among buried wehrmacht soldiers were the graves of 48 waffen ss members at the insistence of german chancellor helmut kohl and over the vocal objections of jewish groups the trip went through35 in an interview author elie wiesel described attending a white house meeting of jewish leaders about the trip the only one really defending the trip was pat buchanan saying we cannot give the perception of the president being subjected to jewish pressure36 buchanan accused wiesel of fabricating the story in an abc interview in 1992 i didnt say it and elie wiesel wasnt even in the meeting that meeting was held three weeks before the bitburg summit was held if i had said that it would have been out of there within hours and on the news37 vdareedit buchanan has contributed to vdare since 200538 vdare is a right wing website and blog founded by antiimmigration activist and paleoconservative peter brimelow39 vdare is considered controversial because of its alleged ties to white supremacist rhetoric and support of scientific racism and white nationalism40414243 it has been designated as a hate group by the southern poverty law center44 political careeredit 1992 presidential primariesedit main article republican party united states presidential primaries 1992 logo used for buchanans 1992 and 1996 campaigns in 1990 buchanan published a newsletter called patrick j buchanan from the right it sent subscribers a bumper sticker reading read our lips no new taxes45 in 1992 buchanan explained his reasons for challenging the incumbent president george hw bush if the country wants to go in a liberal direction if the country wants to go in the direction of democrats george mitchell and tom foley it doesnt bother me as long as ive made the best case i can what i cant stand are the backroom deals theyre all in on it the insider game the establishment game—this is what were running against9 he ran on a platform of immigration reduction and social conservatism including opposition to multiculturalism abortion and gay rights buchanan seriously challenged bush whose popularity was waning when he won 38 percent of the seminal new hampshire primary in the primary elections buchanan garnered three million total votes or 23 of the vote buchanan later threw his support behind bush and delivered an address at the 1992 republican national convention which became known as the culture war speech in which he described a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america46 in the speech he said of bill and hillary clinton the agenda clinton clinton would impose on america—abortion on demand a litmus test for the supreme court homosexual rights discrimination against religious schools women in combat units—thats change all right but it is not the kind of change america needs it is not the kind of change america wants and it is not the kind of change we can abide in a nation we still call gods country47 buchanan also said in reference to the then recentlyheld 1992 democratic national convention like many of you last month i watched that giant masquerade ball at madison square garden—where 20000 radicals and liberals came dressed up as moderates and centrists—in the greatest single exhibition of crossdressing in american political history 48 the enthusiastic applause he received prompted his detractors to claim that the speech alienated moderates from the bushquayle ticket49 the newspaper columnist molly ivins wrote many people did not care for pat buchanans speech it probably sounded better in the original german50 off the campaign trailedit buchanan returned to his column and crossfire to promote the principles of federalism traditional values and antiintervention he founded the american cause a conservative educational foundation in 1993 bay buchanan serves as the vienna vabased foundations president and pat is its chairman51 buchanan returned to radio as host of buchanan and company a threehour talk show for mutual broadcasting system on july 5 1993 it pitted him against liberal cohosts including barry lynn bob beckel and chris matthews in a time slot opposite rush limbaughs show to launch his 1996 campaign buchanan left the program on march 20 1995 1996 presidential primariesedit main article republican party united states presidential primaries 1996 1996 saw buchanans most successful attempt to win the republican nomination with a democratic president bill clinton seeking reelection there was no incumbent republican with a lock on the ticket indeed with former president george h w bush having made clear he was not interested in regaining the office the closest the party had to a frontrunner was the senate majority leader sen bob dole of kansas who was considered to have many weaknesses buchanan sought the republican nomination from doles right voicing his opposition to the north american free trade agreement nafta other candidates for the nomination included sen phil gramm of texas former tennessee governor lamar alexander and the multimillionaire publisher steve forbes in february the liberal center for public integrity issued a report claiming buchanans presidential campaign cochairman larry pratt appeared at two meetings organized by white supremacist and militia leaders pratt denied any tie to racism calling the report an orchestrated smear before the new hampshire primary buchanan told the manchester union leader he believed pratt pratt took a leave of absence to answer these charges so as not to have distraction in the campaign52 buchanan defeated dole by about 3000 votes to win the february new hampshire primary getting his campaign off to an energetic start he was endorsed by conservative icon phyllis schlafly among others he won three other states alaska missouri and louisiana and finished only slightly behind dole in the iowa caucus his insurgent campaign used his soaring rhetoric to mobilize grassroots right wing opinion against what he saw as the bland washington establishment personified by dole which he believed had controlled the party for years at a rally later in nashua he said we shocked them in alaska stunned them in louisiana stunned them in iowa they are in a terminal panic they hear the shouts of the peasants from over the hill all the knights and barons will be riding into the castle pulling up the drawbridge in a minute all the peasants are coming with pitchforks were going to take this over the top53 the line the peasants are coming with pitchforks became somewhat of a slogan for the campaign with buchanan occasionally appearing with a prop pitchfork at rallies in the super tuesday primaries dole defeated buchanan by large margins having collected only 21 percent of the total votes or 31 million in republican primaries buchanan suspended his campaign in march he declared that if dole were to choose a prochoice running mate he would run as the us taxpayers party now constitution party candidate54 dole chose jack kemp and he received buchanans endorsement after the 1996 campaign buchanan returned to his column and crossfire he also began a series of books with 1998s the great betrayal 2000 presidential campaignedit main articles reform party united states presidential primaries 2000 and pat buchanan presidential campaign 2000 buchanan announced his departure from the republican party in october 1999 disparaging them along with the democrats as a beltway party he sought the nomination of the reform party many reformers backed iowa physicist john hagelin whose platform was based on transcendental meditation party founder ross perot did not endorse either candidate for the reform partys nomination in late october 2000 perot publicly endorsed george w bush but perots 1996 runningmate pat choate would go on to endorse buchanan supporters of hagelin charged the results of the partys open primary which favored buchanan by a wide margin were tainted the reform party divisions led to dual conventions being held simultaneously in separate areas of the long beach convention center complex both conventions delegates ignored the primary ballots and voted to nominate their presidential candidates from the floor similar to the democratic and republican conventions one convention nominated buchanan while the other backed hagelin with each camp claiming to be the legitimate reform party ultimately when the federal elections commission ruled buchanan was to receive ballot status as the reform candidate as well as about 126 million in federal campaign funds secured by perots showing in the 1996 election buchanan won the nomination in his acceptance speech buchanan proposed us withdrawal from the united nations and expelling the un from new york abolishing the internal revenue service department of education department of energy department of housing and urban development taxes on inheritance and capital gains and affirmative action programs as his running mate buchanan chose africanamerican activist and retired teacher from los angeles ezola b foster buchanan was supported in this election run by future socialist party usa presidential candidate brian moore who said in 2008 he supported buchanan in 2000 because he was for fair trade over free trade he had some progressive positions that i thought would be helpful to the common man55 on august 19 the new york right to life party in convention chose buchanan as their nominee with 90 percent of the districts voting for him56 in a campaign speech at bob jones university in greenville south carolina buchanan attempted to rally his conservative base god and the ten commandments have all been expelled from the public schools christmas carols are out christmas holidays are out the latest decision of the united states supreme court said that children in stadiums or young people in high school games are not to speak an inspirational moment for fear they may mention gods name and offend an atheist in the grandstand we may not succeed but i believe we need a new fighting conservative traditionalist party in america i believe and i hope that one day we can take america back that is why we are building this gideons army and heading for armageddon to do battle for the lord 57 in the 2000 presidential election buchanan finished fourth with 449895 votes 04 of the popular vote hagelin garnered 01 percent as the natural law candidate in palm beach county florida buchanan received 3407 votes—which some saw as inconsistent with palm beach countys liberal leanings its large jewish population and his showing in the rest of the state as a result of the countys nowinfamous butterfly ballot he is suspected to have gained thousands of inadvertent votes bush spokesman ari fleischer stated palm beach county is a pat buchanan stronghold and thats why pat buchanan received 3407 votes there reform party officials strongly disagreed estimating the number of supporters in the county at between 400 and 500 appearing on the today show buchanan said when i took one look at that ballot on election night its very easy for me to see how someone could have voted for me in the belief they voted for al gore58 some observers said his campaign was aimed to spread his message beyond his white conservative and populist base while his views had not changed59 in retrospect buchanan told the daily caller explicitly in october 2012 that what cost al gore florida in 2000 and the presidency was the butterfly ballot60 later political involvementedit following the 2000 election reform party members urged buchanan to take an active role within the party buchanan declined though he did attend their 2001 convention in the next few years he identified himself as a political independent choosing not to align himself with what he viewed as the neoconservative republican party leadership prior to the 2004 election buchanan announced he once again identified himself as a republican declared that he had no interest in ever running for president again and reluctantly endorsed bushs 2004 reelection writing bush is right on taxes judges sovereignty and values kerry is right on nothing61 buchanan also endorsed republican presidential candidate mitt romney in 2012 stating in an article that obama offers more of the stalemate america has gone through for the past two years while romney alone offers a possibility of hope and change62 buchanan supported the nomination of donald trump who ran on many of the same positions that buchanan ran on twenty years prior as republican presidential candidate for the 2016 presidential election6364 return to private lifeedit msnbc commentatoredit buchanan being interviewed in 2008 although cnn decided not to take him back buchanans column resumed65 a longer variation of the crossfire format was aired by msnbc as buchanan and press on july 15 2002 reuniting

toned down their rivalry as they both opposed the invasion66 press claims they were the first cable hosts to discuss the planned attack67 msnbc editorinchief jerry nachman once jokingly lamented this unusual situation so the point is why does only fox news channel get this at least we work at the perfect place the place thats fiercely independent we try to have balance by putting you two guys together and then this stockholm syndrome love fest set in between the two of you and we no longer even have robust debate68 just hours after his talk show debuted buchanan was a guest on the premiere of msnbcs illfated donahue program host phil donahue and buchanan debated the separation of church and state buchanan called donahue dictatorial69 and teased that the host got his job through

used the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the german invasion of poland to argue that britain should not have declared war on germany7273 this revived charges of antisemitism and helping to legitimize holocaust denial in january 2012 buchanan was indefinitely suspended from msnbc as a contributor and msnbc president phil griffin said he had not decided whether to let buchanan come back
