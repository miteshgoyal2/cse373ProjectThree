party is one of the worlds oldest extant political parties it is the second oldest existing political party in the united states after its primary rival the democratic party it emerged in 1854 to combat the kansas–nebraska act an act that dissolved the terms of the missouri compromise and allowed slave or free status to be decided in the territories by popular sovereignty the party had almost no presence in the southern united states but by 1858 in the north it had enlisted former whigs and former free soil democrats to form majorities in nearly every northern state with its election of abraham lincoln in 1860 and its success in guiding the union to victory and abolishing slavery the party came to dominate the national political scene until 1932 the republican party was based on northern white protestants businessmen small business owners professionals factory workers farmers and african americans it was probusiness supporting banks the gold standard railroads and high tariffs to protect factory workers and grow industry faster under william mckinley and theodore roosevelt it emphasized an expansive foreign policy the gop lost its majorities during the great depression 1929–1940 instead the democrats under franklin d roosevelt formed a winning new deal coalition which was dominant from 1932 through 1964 that coalition collapsed in the mid1960s partly because of white southern democrats disaffection with passage of the civil rights act of 1964 republicans won five of the six presidential elections from 1968 to 1988 with ronald reagan as the partys iconic conservative hero from 1992 to 2016 the republican candidate has been elected to the white house in three of the seven presidential elections—and only in one out of those three elections in 2004 did he win the popular vote the gop expanded its base throughout the south after 1968 excepting 1976 largely due to its strength among socially conservative white evangelical protestants and traditionalist roman catholics as white democrats in the south lost dominance of the democratic party once us courts declared the democratic white primary elections unconstitutional the region began taking on the twoparty apparatus which characterized most of the nation the republican partys transforming leader by 1980 was reagan whose conservative policies called for reduced government spending and regulation lower taxes and a strong antisoviet foreign policy his influence upon the party persists as nearly every gop speaker still reveres him this includes current us president donald trump who prominently utilized his own version of reagans lets make america great again slogan during the 2016 us election social scientists theodore caplow et al argue the republican party nationally moved

primary sources ideological beginningsedit see also third party system the republican party began as a coalition of antislavery conscience whigs and free soil democrats opposed to the kansas–nebraska act submitted to congress by stephen douglas in january 1854 the act opened kansas territory and nebraska territory to slavery and future admission as slave states thus implicitly repealing the prohibition on slavery in territory north of 36° 30′ latitude which had been part of the missouri compromise this change was viewed by free soil and abolitionist northerners as an aggressive expansionist maneuver by the slaveowning south the act was supported by all southerners by northern doughface prosouthern democrats and by other northern democrats persuaded by douglas doctrine of popular sovereignty in the north the old whig party was almost defunct the opponents were intensely motivated and began forming a new party2 the new party went well beyond the issue of slavery in the territories it envisioned modernizing the united states—emphasizing giving free western land to farmers free soil as opposed to letting slave owners buy up the best lands expanded banking more railroads and factories they vigorously argued that free market labor was superior to slavery and the very foundation of civic virtue and true republicanism—this was the free soil free labor free men ideology2 the republicans absorbed the previous traditions of its members most of whom had been whigs while others had been democrats or members of third parties especially the free soil party and the american party also known as the know nothings many democrats who joined were rewarded with governorshipsnote 1 or seats in the us senatenote 2 or house of representativesnote 3 since its inception its chief opposition has been the democratic party but the amount of flow back and forth of prominent politicians between the two parties was quite high from 1854 to 1896 historians have explored the ethnocultural foundations of the party along the line that ethnic and religious groups set the moral standards for their members who then carried those standards into politics the churches also provided social networks that politicians used to sign up voters the pietistic churches emphasized the duty of the christian to purge sin from society sin took many forms—alcoholism polygamy and slavery became special targets for the republicans3 the yankees who dominated new england much of upstate new york and much of the upper midwest were the strongest supporters of the new party this was especially true for the pietistic congregationalists and presbyterians among them and during the war the methodists along with scandinavian lutherans the quakers were a small tightknit group that was heavily republican by contrast the liturgical churches roman catholic episcopal and german lutheran largely rejected the moralism of the republican party and most of their adherents voted democratic3 the early standard bearers of the party expressed views of government that marked the first years of its existence for instance william h seward new york governor who vied with lincoln for the nomination in 1860 had called for welcoming immigrants with all the sympathy that their misfortunes at home their condition as strangers here and their devotion to liberty ought to excite4 in his 1861 message to congress lincoln argued that the essential reason for preserving the central government was to maintain in the world that form and substance of government whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men – to lift artificial weights from all shoulders – to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all – to afford all an unfettered start and a fair chance in the race of life5 organizational beginningsedit the first antinebraska local meeting where republican was suggested as a name for a new antislavery party was held in ripon wisconsin schoolhouse on march 20 18546 the first statewide convention that formed a platform and nominated candidates under the name republican was held near jackson michigan on july 6 1854 it declared their new party opposed to the expansion of slavery into new territories and selected a statewide slate of candidates the midwest took the lead in forming state party tickets while the eastern states lagged a year or so there were no efforts to organize the party in the north apart from st louis and a few areas adjacent to free states the party initially had its base in the northeast and midwest this democratic editorial cartoon links frémont to other radical movements including temperance feminism fourierism free love catholicism and abolition establishing a national party and oppositionedit the party launched its first national convention in pittsburgh pennsylvania on february 22 18567 with its first national nominating convention held in the summer in philadelphia pennsylvania8 presided by francis preston blair sr john c frémont ran as the first republican nominee for president in 1856 behind the slogan free soil free silver free men frémont and victory and although frémonts bid was unsuccessful the party showed a strong base it dominated in new england new york and the northern midwest and had a strong presence in the rest of the northit had almost no support in the south where it was roundly denounced in 1856–1860 as a divisive force that threatened civil war9 without using the term containment the new party in the mid1850s proposed a system of containing slavery once it gained control of the national government historian james oakes explains the strategy the federal government would surround the south with free states free territories and free waters building what they called a cordon of freedom around slavery hemming it in until the systems own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery10 leading up to the second presidential election after the partys establishment disdain for it grew considerably among democrats particularly those from the south in reference to the republicans antislavery position prominent democrats applied the slur black republican against them as seen repeatedly in the speeches of senator stephen douglas during the lincolndouglas debates of 1858 in illinois during the presidential campaign in 1860 at a time of escalating tension between the north and south abraham lincoln addressed the harsh treatment of republicans in the south in his famous cooper union speech when you speak of us republicans you do so only to denounce us as reptiles or at the best as no better than outlaws you will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers but nothing like it to black republicans but you will not abide the election of a republican president in that supposed event you say you will destroy the union and then you say the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us that is cool a highwayman holds a pistol to my ear and mutters through his teeth stand and deliver or i shall kill you and then you will be a murderer the civil war and republican dominance 1860–1896edit union ticket in 1864 as party men gave these to voters to deposit in the ballot box the election of lincoln in 1860 opened a new era of republican dominance based in the industrial north and agricultural midwest the third party system was dominated by the republican party it lost the presidency only in 1884 and 1892 lincoln proved brilliantly successful in uniting the factions of his party to fight for the union11 however he usually fought the radical republicans who demanded harsher measures most democrats at first were war democrats and supportive until the fall of 1862 when lincoln added the abolition of slavery as a war goal many war democrats became peace democrats most of the state republican parties accepted the antislavery goal except kentucky in congress the party passed major legislation to promote rapid modernization including a national banking system high tariffs the first temporary income tax many excise taxes paper money issued without backing greenbacks a huge national debt homestead laws railroads and aid to education and agriculture the republicans denounced the peaceoriented democrats as disloyal copperheads and won enough war democrats to maintain their majority in 1862 in 1864 they formed a coalition with many war democrats as the national union party which reelected lincoln easily during the war upper middleclass men in major cities formed union leagues to promote and help finance the war effort first colored senator and representatives sen hiram revels rms rep benjamin turner ral robert delarge rsc josiah walls rfl jefferson long rga joseph rainey and robert b elliott rsc 1872 reconstruction freedmen carpetbaggers and scalawagsedit in reconstruction how to deal with the ex confederates and the freed slaves or freedmen were the major issues by 1864 radical republicans controlled congress and demanded more aggressive action against slavery and more vengeance toward the confederates lincoln held them off but just barely as republicans at first welcomed president andrew johnson while the radicals thought he was one of them and would take a hard line in punishing the south however johnson broke with them and formed a loose alliance with moderate republicans and democrats the showdown came in the congressional elections of 1866 in which the radicals won a sweeping victory and took full control of reconstruction passing key laws over the veto johnson was impeached by the house but acquitted by the senate ulysses s grant was the first republican president to serve for two full terms 1869–1877 with the election of ulysses s grant in 1868 the radicals had control of congress the party and the army and attempted to build a solid republican base in the south using the votes of freedmen scalawags and carpetbaggers9 supported directly by us army detachments republicans all across the south formed local clubs called union leagues that effectively mobilized the voters discussed issues and when necessary fought off ku klux klan kkk attacks thousands died on both sides12 grant supported radical reconstruction programs in the south the fourteenth amendment and equal civil and voting rights for the freedmen most of all he was the hero of the war veterans who marched to his tune the party had become so large that factionalism was inevitable it was hastened by grants tolerance of high levels of corruption typified by the whiskey ring many of the founders of the gop joined the liberal movement as did many powerful newspaper editors they nominated horace greeley for president who also gained the democratic nomination but the ticket was defeated in a landslide the depression of 1873 energized the democrats they won control of the house and formed redeemer coalitions which recaptured control of each southern state in some cases using threats and violence reconstruction came to an end when the contested election of 1876 was awarded by a special electoral commission to republican rutherford b hayes who promised through the unofficial compromise of 1877 to withdraw federal troops from control of the last three southern states the region then became the solid south giving overwhelming majorities of its electoral votes and congressional seats to the democrats through 1964 in terms of racial issues sarah woolfolk wiggins argues that in alabama white republicans as well as democrats solicited black votes but reluctantly rewarded blacks with nominations for office only when necessary even then reserving the more choice positions for whites the results were predictable these halfaloaf gestures satisfied neither black nor white republicans the fatal weakness of the republican party in alabama as elsewhere in the south was its inability to create a biracial political party and while in power even briefly they failed to protect their members from democratic terror alabama republicans were forever on the defensive verbally and physically13 social pressure eventually forced most scalawags to join the conservativedemocratic redeemer coalition a minority persisted and formed the tan half of the black and tan republican party a minority in every southern state after 187714 in several southern states the lily whites who sought to recruit white democrats to the republican party attempted to purge the black and tan faction or at least to reduce its influence among such lily white leaders in the early 20th century arkansas wallace townsend was the partys gubernatorial nominee in 1916 and 1920 and its veteran national gop committeeman15 starting in the 1870s southern republicans were divided into two factions the lilywhite faction which was practically allwhite and the biracial blackandtan faction16 the factionalism flared up in 192817 and 195218 the final victory of its opponent the lilywhite faction came in 196419 the gilded age 1877–1890edit further information history of conservatism in the united states § the gilded age and gilded age the gop short for grand old party as it was now nicknamed split into factions in the late 1870s the stalwarts followers of senator roscoe conkling defended the spoils system the halfbreeds who followed senator james g blaine of maine pushed for reform of the civil service independents who opposed the spoils system altogether were called mugwumps in 1884 mugwumps rejected james g blaine as corrupt and helped elect democrat grover cleveland though most returned to the party by 1888 as the northern postwar economy boomed with industry railroads mines and fastgrowing cities as well as prosperous agriculture the republicans took credit and promoted policies to keep the fast growth going the democratic party was largely controlled by probusiness bourbon democrats until 1896 the gop supported big business generally the gold standard high tariffs and generous pensions for union veterans however by 1890 the republicans had agreed to the sherman antitrust act and the interstate commerce commission in response to complaints from owners of small businesses and farmers the high mckinley tariff of 1890 hurt the party and the democrats swept to a landslide in the offyear elections even defeating mckinley himself foreign affairs seldom became partisan issues except for the annexation of hawaii which republicans favored and democrats opposed much more salient were cultural issues the gop supported the pietistic protestants especially the methodists congregationalists presbyterians and scandinavian lutherans who demanded prohibition that angered wet republicans especially german americans who broke ranks in 1890–1892 handing power to the democrats20 demographic trends aided the democrats as the german and irish catholic immigrants were mostly democrats and outnumbered the british and scandinavian republicans during the 1880s elections were remarkably close the democrats usually lost but won in 1884 and 1892 in the 1894 congressional elections the gop scored the biggest landslide in its history as democrats were blamed for the severe economic depression 1893–1897 and the violent coal and railroad strikes of 189420 ethnocultural politics pietistic republicans versus liturgical democratsedit

romanism and rebellion rum stood for the liquor interests and the tavernkeepers in contrast to the gop which had a strong dry element romanism meant roman catholics especially irish americans who ran the democratic party in every big city and whom the republicans denounced for political corruption rebellion stood for the democrats of the confederacy who tried to break the union in 1861 and the democrats in the north called copperheads who sympathized with them demographic trends aided the democrats as the german and irish catholic immigrants were democrats and outnumbered the english and scandinavian republicans during the 1880s and 1890s the republicans struggled against the democrats efforts winning several close elections and losing two to grover cleveland in 1884 and 1892 religious lines were sharply drawn22 methodists congregationalists presbyterians scandinavian lutherans and other pietists in the north were tightly linked to the gop in sharp contrast liturgical groups especially the catholics episcopalians and german lutherans looked to the democratic party for protection from pietistic moralism especially prohibition both parties cut across the class structure with the democrats more bottomheavy cultural issues especially prohibition and foreign language schools became important because of the sharp religious divisions in the electorate in the north about 50 of the voters were pietistic protestants methodists scandinavian lutherans presbyterians congregationalists and disciples of christ who believed the government should be used to reduce social sins such as drinking22 liturgical churches roman catholics german lutherans and episcopalians comprised over a quarter of the vote and wanted the government to stay out of the morality business prohibition debates and referendums heated up politics in most states over a period of decade as national prohibition was finally passed in 1919 repealed in 1933 serving as a major issue between the wet democrats and the dry gop22 the progressive era 1896–1932edit see also fourth party system the election of william mckinley in 1896 is widely seen as a resurgence of republican dominance and is cited as a realigning election23 an 1896 gop poster warns against free silver the progressive era or fourth party system was dominated by republican presidents with the sole exception of democrat woodrow wilson 1913–1921 mckinley promised that high tariffs would end the severe hardship caused by the panic of 1893 and that the gop would guarantee a sort of pluralism in which all groups would benefit he denounced william jennings bryan the democratic nominee as a dangerous radical whose plans for free silver at 16–1 or bimetallism would bankrupt the economy mckinley relied heavily on finance railroads industry and the middle classes for his support and cemented the republicans as the party of business his campaign manager ohios mark hanna developed a detailed plan for getting contributions from the business world and mckinley outspent his rival william jennings bryan by a large margin this emphasis on business was in part mitigated by theodore roosevelt the presidential successor after mckinleys assassination in 1901 who engaged in trustbusting mckinley was the first president to promote pluralism arguing that prosperity would be shared by all ethnic and religious groups20 theodore roosevelt who became president in 1901 had the most dynamic personality of the era roosevelt had to contend with men like senator mark hanna whom he outmaneuvered to gain control of the convention in 1904 that renominated him and he won after promising to continue mckinleys policies more difficult to handle was conservative house speaker joseph gurney cannon tr leads party to landslide win in 1904 roosevelt achieved modest legislative gains in terms of railroad legislation and pure food laws he was more successful in court bringing antitrust suits that broke up the northern securities company trust and standard oil roosevelt moved to the left in his last two years in office but was unable to pass major square deal proposals he did succeed in naming his successor secretary of war william howard taft who easily defeated bryan again in the 1908 presidential election president theodore roosevelt watches gop team pull apart on tariff issue the tariff issue was pulling the gop apart roosevelt tried to postpone the issue but taft had to meet it head on in 1909 with the payne–aldrich tariff act eastern conservatives led by nelson w aldrich wanted high tariffs on manufactured goods especially woolens while midwesterners called for low tariffs aldrich tricked them by lowering the tariff on farm products which outraged the farmers insurgent midwesterners led by george norris revolted against the conservatives led by speaker cannon the democrats won control of the house in 1910 as the rift between insurgents and conservatives widened9 in 1912 roosevelt broke with taft and tried for a third term but he was outmaneuvered by taft and lost the nomination roosevelt led his delegates out of the convention and created a new party the progressive or bull moose ticket in the election of 1912 few party leaders followed him except hiram johnson of california roosevelt had the support of many notable women reformers including jane addams2425 the rooseveltcaused split in the republican vote resulted in a decisive victory for democrat woodrow wilson temporarily interrupting the republican era9 the republicans welcomed the progressive era at the state and local level the first important reform mayor was hazen s pingree of detroit 1890–1897 who was elected governor of michigan in 1896 in new york city the republicans joined nonpartisan reformers to battle tammany hall and elected seth low 1902–1903 golden rule jones was first elected mayor of toledo as a republican in 1897 but was reelected as an independent when his party refused to renominate him many republican civic leaders following the example of mark hanna were active in the national civic federation which promoted urban reforms and sought to avoid wasteful strikes trs 1908 farewell speeches sought progressive goals but did not pass congress the party controlled the presidency throughout the 1920s running on a platform of opposition to the league of nations high tariffs and promotion of business interests warren g harding calvin coolidge and herbert hoover were resoundingly elected in 1920 1924 and 1928 respectively the breakaway efforts of senator robert la follette in 1924 failed to stop a landslide for coolidge and his movement fell apart the teapot dome scandal threatened to hurt the party but harding died and coolidge blamed everything on him as the opposition splintered in 192420 the probusiness policies of the decade seemed to produce an unprecedented prosperity—until the wall street crash of 1929 heralded the great depression although the party did very well in large cities and among ethnic catholics in presidential elections of 1920–1924 it was unable to hold those gains in 192820 by 1932 the cities—for the first time ever—had become democratic strongholds hoover was by nature an activist and attempted to do what he could to alleviate the widespread suffering caused by the depression but his strict adherence to what he believed were republican principles precluded him from establishing relief directly from the federal government the depression cost hoover the presidency with the 1932 landslide election of franklin d roosevelt roosevelts new deal coalition controlled american politics for most of the next three decades excepting the twoterm presidency of republican dwight eisenhower the democrats made major gains in the 1930 midterm elections giving them congressional parity though not control for the first time since woodrow wilsons presidency9 progressives and liberalsedit the republican party had a progressive element typified in the early 20th century by theodore roosevelt in the 1907–1912 period roosevelt was more conservative at other points senator robert m la follette sr and his sons in wisconsin from about 1900 to 1946 and western leaders such as senator hiram johnson in california senator george w norris in nebraska senator bronson m cutting in new mexico congresswoman jeannette rankin in montana and senator william borah in idaho they were generally progressive in domestic policy supported unions26 and supported much of the new deal but were isolationist in foreign policy27 this element died out by the 1940s outside congress of the leaders who supported theodore roosevelt in 1912 most opposed the new deal28 starting in the 1930s a number of northeastern republicans took liberal positions regarding labor unions spending and new deal policies they included mayor fiorello la guardia in new york city governor thomas e dewey of new york29 governor earl warren of california governor harold stassen of minnesota senator clifford p case of new jersey henry cabot lodge jr of massachusetts senator prescott bush of connecticut father and grandfather of the two bush presidents senator jacob k javits of new york senator john sherman cooper of kentucky senator george aiken of vermont governor and later senator mark hatfield of oregon governor william scranton of pennsylvania and governor george w romney of michigan30 the most notable of them all was governor nelson a rockefeller of new york31 they generally advocated a freemarket but with some level of regulation rockefeller required employable welfare recipients to take available jobs or job training32 while the media sometimes called them rockefeller republicans the liberal republicans never formed an organized movement or caucus and lacked a recognized leader they promoted economic growth and high state and federal spending while accepting high taxes and much liberal legislation with the provision they could administer it more efficiently they opposed the democratic big city machines while welcoming support from labor unions and big business alike religion was not high on their agenda but they were strong believers in civil rights for african americans and womens rights and most liberals were prochoice they were also strong environmentalists and supporters of higher education in foreign policy they were internationalists throwing their support to dwight d eisenhower over the conservative leader robert a taft in 1952 they were often called the eastern establishment by conservatives such as barry goldwater33 the goldwater conservatives fought this establishment from 196034 defeated it in 1964 and eventually retired most of its members although some became democrats like senator charles goodell and mayor john lindsay in new york35 president richard nixon adopted many of their positions especially regarding health care welfare spending environmentalism and support for the arts and humanities36 after congressman john b anderson of illinois bolted the party in 1980 and ran as an independent against reagan the liberal gop element faded away their old strongholds in the northeast are now mostly held by democrats3337 political firsts for women and minoritiesedit from its inception in 1854 to 1964 when senate republicans pushed hard for passage of the civil rights act of 1964 against a filibuster by senate democrats the gop had a reputation for supporting blacks and minorities in 1869 the republicancontrolled legislature in wyoming territory and its republican governor john allen campbell made it the first jurisdiction to grant voting rights to women in 1875 california swore in the first hispanic governor republican romualdo pacheco in 1916 jeannette rankin of montana became the first woman in congress—and indeed the first woman in any high level government position in 1928 new mexico elected the first hispanic us senator republican octaviano larrazolo in 1898 the first jewish us senator elected from outside of the former confederacy was republican joseph simon of oregon in 1924 the first jewish woman elected to the us house of representatives was republican florence kahn of california in 1928 the republican us senate majority leader charles curtis of kansas who grew up on the kaw indian reservation became the first person of significant noneuropean ancestry to be elected to national office as vice president of the united states for herbert hoover blacks generally identified with the gop until the 1930s every african american who served in the us house of representatives before 1935 and all of the african americans who served in the us senate before 1979 were republicans frederick douglass after the civil war and booker t washington in the early 20th century were prominent republican spokesmen in 1966 edward brooke of massachusetts became the first african american popularly elected to the united states senate fighting the new deal coalition 1932–1980edit main articles old right united states and fifth party system historian george h nash argues unlike the moderate internationalist largely eastern bloc of republicans who accepted or at least acquiesced in some of the roosevelt revolution and the essential premises of president trumans foreign policy the republican right at heart was counterrevolutionary anticollectivist anticommunist antinew deal passionately committed to limited government free market economics and congressional as opposed to executive prerogatives the gop conservatives were obliged from the start to wage a constant twofront war against liberal democrats from without and metoo republicans from within38 the old right emerged in opposition to the new deal of franklin d roosevelt hoff says that moderate republicans and leftover republican progressives like hoover composed the bulk of the old right by 1940 with a sprinkling of former members of the farmerlabor party nonpartisan league and even a few midwestern prairie socialists39 1933–1938edit after roosevelt took office in 1933 new deal legislation sailed through congress at lightning speed in the 1934 midterm elections ten republican senators went down to defeat leaving them with only 25 against 71 democrats the house of representatives was also split in a similar ratio the second new deal was heavily criticized by the republicans in congress who likened it to class warfare and socialism the volume of legislation as well as the inability of the republicans to block it soon made the opposition to roosevelt develop into bitterness and sometimes hatred for that man in the white house former president hoover became a leading orator crusading against the new deal hoping unrealistically to be nominated again for president4041 most major newspaper publishers favored republican moderate alf landon for president in the nations 15 largest cities the newspapers that editorially endorsed landon represented 70 of the circulation while roosevelt won 69 of the actual voters in those cities ignoring the press and used the radio to reach voters directly42 roosevelt carried 46 of the 48 states thanks to traditional democrats along with newly energized labor unions city machines and the wpa the realignment creating the fifth party system was firmly in place43 since 1928 the gop had lost 178 house seats 40 senate seats and 19 governorships though it retained a mere 89 seats in the house and 16 in the senate44 the black vote held for hoover in 1932 but started moving toward roosevelt by 1940 the majority of northern blacks were voting democratic roosevelt made sure blacks had a share in relief programs the wartime army and wartime defense industry but did not challenge segregation or the denial of voting rights in the south45 minority parties tend to factionalize and after 1936 the gop split into a conservative faction dominant in the west and midwest and a liberal faction dominant in the northeast—combined with a residual base of inherited progressive republicanism active throughout the century in 1936 kansas governor alf landon and his young followers defeated the herbert hoover faction landon generally supported most new deal programs but carried only two states in the roosevelt landslide with his moderate campaign the gop was left with only 16 senators and 88 representatives to oppose the new deal with massachusetts senator henry cabot lodge jr as the sole victor over a democratic incumbent roosevelt alienated many conservative democrats in 1937 by his unexpected plan to pack the supreme court via the judiciary reorganization bill of 1937 following a sharp recession that hit early in 1938 major strikes all over the country the cio and afl competing with each other for membership and roosevelts failed efforts to radically reorganize the supreme court the democrats were in disarray meanwhile the gop was united as they had shed their weakest members in a series of defeats since 193046 reenergized republicans focused attention on strong fresh candidates in major states especially robert a taft the conservative from ohio47 earl warren the moderate who won both the republicans and the democratic primaries in california48 and thomas dewey the crusading prosecutor from new york49 the gop comeback in 1938 was made possible by carrying 50 of the vote outside the south giving gop leaders confidence it had a strong base for the 1940 presidential election5051 the gop gained 75 house seats in 1938 but were still a minority conservative democrats mostly from the south joined with republicans led by senator robert a taft to create the conservative coalition which dominated domestic issues in congress until 196452 1939–1952edit from 1939 through 1941 there was a sharp debate within the gop about support for britain in world war ii internationalists such as henry stimson and frank knox wanted to support britain and isolationists such as robert a taft and arthur vandenberg strongly opposed these moves as unwise if not unconstitutional the america first movement was a bipartisan coalition of isolationists in 1940 a total unknown wendell willkie at the last minute won over the party the delegates and was nominated he crusaded against the inefficiencies of the new deal and roosevelts break with the strong tradition against a third term29 the japanese attack on pearl harbor in 1941 ended the isolationistinternationalist debate the republicans further cut the democratic majority in the 1942 midterm elections with wartime production creating prosperity the conservative coalition terminated most new deal relief programs29 senator robert a taft of ohio represented the wing of the party that continued to oppose new deal reforms and continued to champion noninterventionism thomas dewey governor of new york represented the northeastern wing of the party dewey did not reject the new deal programs but demanded more efficiency more support for economic growth and less corruption he was more willing than taft to support britain in 1939–1940 after the war the isolationists wing strenuously opposed the united nations and was halfhearted in opposition to world communism2953 as a minority party the gop had two wings the leftwing supported most of the new deal while promising to run it more efficiently and the rightwing opposed the new deal from the beginning and managed to repeal large parts during the 1940s in cooperation with conservative southern democrats in the conservative coalition liberals led by dewey dominated the northeast while conservatives led by taft dominated the midwest54 the west was split and the south was still solidly democratic in 1944 a clearly frail roosevelt defeated dewey who was now governor of new york for his fourth term but dewey made a good showing that would lead to his selection as the candidate in 194854 roosevelt died in april 1945 and harry s truman a less liberal democrat became president and replaced most of roosevelts top appointees with the end of the war unrest among organized labor led to many strikes in 1946 and the resulting disruptions helped the gop with the blunders of the truman administration in 1945 and 1946 the slogans had enough and to err is truman became republican rallying cries and the gop won control of congress for the first time since 1928 with joseph william martin jr as speaker of the house the tafthartley act of 1947 was designed to balance the rights of management and labor it was the central issue of many elections in industrial states in the 1940s to 1950s but the unions were never able to repeal it in 1948 with republicans split left and right truman boldly called congress into a special session and sent it a load of liberal legislation consistent with the dewey platform and dared them to act on it knowing that the conservative republicans would block action truman then attacked the republican donothing congress as a whipping boy for all of the nations problems truman stunned dewey and the republicans in the election with a plurality of just over two million popular votes out of nearly 49 million cast but a decisive 303–189 victory in the electoral college eisenhower and nixon 1952–1974edit dwight d eisenhower and richard nixon 1953 the first republican presidential inauguration in 24 years in 1952 dwight d eisenhower an internationalist allied with the dewey wing was drafted as a gop candidate by a small group of republicans led by henry cabot lodge jr in order that he challenge taft on foreign policy issues the two men were not far apart on domestic issues eisenhowers victory broke a twentyyear democratic lock on the white house eisenhower did not try to roll back the new deal but he did expand the social security system and built the interstate highway system after 1945 the isolationists in the conservative wing opposed the united nations and were halfhearted in opposition to the expansion of communism around the world55 a garrison state to fight communism they believed would mean regimentation and government controls at home eisenhower the supreme headquarters allied expeditionary force commander defeated taft in 1952 on foreign policy issues citizens for eisenhoweredit to circumvent the local republican party apparatus mostly controlled by taft supporters the eisenhower forces created a nationwide network of grassroots clubs citizens for eisenhower independents and democrats were welcome as the group specialized in canvassing neighborhoods and holding small group meetings citizens for eisenhower hoped to revitalize the gop by expanding its activist ranks and by supporting moderate and internationalist policies it did not endorse candidates other than eisenhower but he paid it little attention after he won and it failed to maintain its impressive starting momentum instead the conservative republicans became energized leading to the barry goldwater nomination of 1964 longtime republican activists viewed the newcomers with suspicion and hostility more significantly activism in support of eisenhower did not translate into enthusiasm for the party cause56 once in office eisenhower was not an effective party leader and nixon increasingly took that role historian david reinhard concludes that eisenhower lacked sustained political commitment refused to intervene in state politics failed to understand the political uses of presidential patronage and overestimated his personal powers of persuasion and conciliation eisenhowers attempt in 1956 to convert the gop to modern republicanism was his grandest flop it was a vague proposal with weak staffing and little financing or publicity that caused turmoil inside the local parties across the country the gop carried both houses of congress in 1952 on eisenhowers coattails but in 1954 lost both and would not regain the senate until 1980 nor the house until 1994 the problem says reinhard was the voters liked ike—but not the gop57 nixon and goldwateredit eisenhower was an exception to most presidents in that he usually let vice president richard nixon handle party affairs controlling the national committee and taking the roles of chief spokesman and chief fundraiser nixon was defeated in 1960 in a close election weakening his moderate wing of the party58 the conservatives in 1964 made a comeback under the leadership of barry goldwater who defeated moderates and liberals such as nelson rockefeller and henry cabot lodge jr as the republican candidate for the 1964 election goldwater was strongly opposed to the new deal and the united nations but he rejected isolationism and containment calling for an aggressive anticommunist foreign policy59 in the presidential election of 1964 he was defeated by lyndon johnson in a landslide that brought down many senior republican congressmen across the country goldwater won five states in the deep south the strongest showing by a republican presidential candidate in the south since 1872 goldwater blamed the magnitude of his defeat on the assassination of john f kennedy a year before the election and on johnson running a successful campaigncitation needed the new deal coalition collapsed in the mid1960s in the face of urban riots the vietnam war the opposition of many southern democrats to desegregation and the civil rights movement and disillusionment that the new deal could be revived by lyndon johnsons great society nixon defeated both hubert humphrey and george c wallace in 1968 when the democratic left took over their party in 1972 nixon won reelection by carrying 49 states nixons involvement in watergate brought disgrace and a forced resignation in 1974 and any longterm movement toward the gop was interrupted by the scandal gerald ford succeeded nixon and gave him a full pardon—thereby giving the democrats a powerful issue they used to sweep the 1974 offyear elections ford never fully recovered and in 1976 he barely defeated ronald reagan for the nomination the one positive to come from fords brief presidency was the outspoken personality of first lady betty ford ford took several liberal positions on social issues regarding breast cancer awareness following her mastectomy in 1974 to add to her outspoken persona she was a staunch supporter of and activist for the equal rights amendment era prochoice on abortion and a leader in the womens movement she gained fame as one of the most candid first ladies in history commenting on every hot button issue of the time including feminism equal pay the era sex drugs abortion civil rights and gun control her liberal positions and her outspoken personality garnered her high approval ratings throughout her husbands term in office despite opposition from the conservative wing of the gop who objected to her liberal stances and even a few members of fords cabinet like dick cheney and donald rumsfeld advised ford to ask her to tone down her outspoken views to avoid losing voters but ford declined to do so despite the candid nature of the first lady and the end of the vietnam war democrats ended up with major gains in congress and the taint of watergate and the nations economic difficulties contributed to the election of democrat jimmy carter in 1976 running as a washington outsider ronald reagan was elected president in the 1980 election by a landslide vote not predicted by most voter polling running on a peace through strength platform to combat the communist threat and massive tax cuts to revitalize the economy reagans strong persona proved too much for carter reagans election also gave republicans control of the senate for the first time in decades dubbed the reagan revolution he fundamentally altered several long standing debates in washington namely dealing with the soviet threat and reviving the economy his election saw the conservative wing of the party gain control while reviled by liberal opponents in his day his proponents contend his programs provided unprecedented economic growth and spurred the collapse of the soviet union detractors of reagans policies note that although reagan promised to simultaneously slash taxes massively increase defense spending and balance the budget by the time he left office the nations budget deficit had tripled in his eight years in office in 2009 reagans budget director noted that the debt explosion has resulted not from big spending by the democrats but instead the republican partys embrace about three decades ago of the insidious doctrine that deficits dont matter if they result from tax cuts he inspired conservatives to greater electoral victories by being reelected in a landslide against walter mondale in 1984 but oversaw the loss of the senate in 1986 strength of parties in 197760 party republican democratic independent

control of legislature and governorship 1 29 0 moderate republicans of 1960–1980edit the term rockefeller republican was used 1960–1980 to designate a faction of the party holding moderate views similar to those of nelson rockefeller governor of new york from 1959 to 1974 and vice president under president gerald ford in 1974–1977 before rockefeller tom dewey governor of new york 1942–1954 and gop presidential nominee in 1944 and 1948 was the leader dwight eisenhower and his aide henry cabot lodge jr reflected many of their views an important moderate leader in the 1950s was connecticut republican senator prescott bush father and grandfather of presidents george h w bush and george w bush respectly after rockefeller left the national stage in 1976 this faction of the party was more often called moderate republicans in contrast to the conservatives who rallied to ronald reagan historically rockefeller republicans were moderate or liberal on domestic and social policies they favored new deal programs including regulation and welfare they were very strong supporters of civil rights they were strongly supported by big business on wall street new york city in fiscal policy they favored balanced budgets and relatively high tax levels to keep the budget balanced they sought longterm economic growth through entrepreneurship not tax cuts in state politics they were strong supporters of state colleges and universities low tuition and large research budgets they favored infrastructure improvements such as highway projects in foreign policy they were internationalists and anticommunists they felt the best way to counter communism was sponsoring economic growth through foreign aid maintaining a strong military and keeping close ties to nato geographically their base was the northeast from maine to pennsylvania where they had the support of major corporations and banks and worked well with labor unions the moderate republicans were topheavy with a surplus of high visibility national leaders and a shortage of grass roots workers most of all they lack the numbers the enthusiasm and excitement the conservatives could mobilize—the moderates decided it must be an unamerican level of fanaticism that drove their opponents doug bailey a senior rockefeller aide recalled there was a mentality in rockefellers campaign staff that look we have got all this money we should be able to buy the people necessary to get this done and you buy from the top down bailey discovered that the rockefeller team never understood that effective political organizations are empowered from the bottom up not the top down61 barry goldwater crusaded against the rockefeller republicans beating rockefeller narrowly in the california primary of 1964 giving the arizona senator all of the california delegates and a majority at the presidential nominating convention the election was a disaster for the conservatives but the goldwater activists now controlled large swaths of the gop and they had no intention of retreating the stage was set for a conservative takeover based in the south and west in opposition to the northeast ronald reagan continued in the same theme george h w bush was more closely associated with the moderates but his son george w bush was firmly allied with the conservatives realignment the south becomes republicanedit before reconstruction and for a century thereafter the white south identified with the democratic party the democratic partys dominance in the southern states was so strong that the region was called the solid south the republicans controlled certain parts of the appalachian mountains62 and they sometimes did compete for statewide office in the border states63 before 1948 the southern democrats saw their party as the defender of the southern way of life which included a respect for states rights and an appreciation for traditional southern values they repeatedly warned against the aggressive designs of northern liberals and republicans as well as the civil rights activists they denounced as outside agitators thus there was a serious barrier to becoming a republican63 in 1948 democrats alienated white southerners in two ways the democratic national convention adopted a strong civil rights plank leading to a walkout by southerners two weeks later president harry truman signed executive order 9981 integrating the armed forces in 1948 the deep south walked out formed a new regional party and nominated j strom thurmond who carried the deep south but the outer south stayed with truman and the dixiecrats returned to the party 1964–1972edit by 1964 the democratic lock on the south remained strong but cracks began to appear one longterm cause was that the region was becoming more like the rest of the nation and could not long stand apart in terms of racial segregation modernization brought factories businesses and larger cities as well as millions of migrants from the north as far more people graduated from high school and college meanwhile the cotton and tobacco basis of the traditional south faded away as former farmers moved to town or commuted to factory jobs segregation requiring separate dining and lodging arrangements for employees was a serious obstacle to business development the highly visible immediate cause of the political transition involved civil rights the civil rights movement caused enormous controversy in the white south with many attacking it as a violation of states rights when segregation was outlawed by court order and by the civil rights acts of 1964 and 1965 a diehard element resisted integration led by democratic governors orval faubus of arkansas lester maddox of georgia ross barnett of mississippi and especially george wallace of alabama these populist governors appealed to a lesseducated bluecollar electorate that on economic grounds favored the democratic party and supported segregation64 after passage of the civil rights act of 1964 most southerners accepted the integration of most institutions except public schools with the old barrier to becoming a republican removed southerners joined the new middle class and the northern transplants in moving toward the republican party integration thus liberated southern politics from the old racial issues in 1963 the federal courts declared unconstitutional the practice of excluding africanamerican voters from the democratic primaries which had been the only elections that mattered in most of the south meanwhile the newly enfranchised black voters supported democratic candidates at the 85–90 level a shift which further convinced many white segregationists that the republicans were no longer the black party64 southern strategyedit some critics most notably dan carter have alleged that the rapid growth in republican strength in the south came from a secretly coded message to wallacites and segregationists that the gop was a racist antiblack party seeking their votes65 political scientists and historians point out that the timing does not fit the southern strategy model nixon carried 49 states in 1972 so he operated a successful national rather than regional strategy but the republican party remained quite weak at the local and state level across the entire south for decades matthew lassiter argues that nixons appeal was not to the wallacites or segregationists but rather to the rapidly emerging suburban middleclass many had northern antecedents and they wanted rapid economic growth and saw the need to put backlash politics to rest lassiter says the southern strategy was a failure for the gop and that the southern base of the republican party always depended more on the middleclass corporate economy and on the topdown politics of racial backlash furthermore realignment in the south quote came primarily from the suburban ethos of new south metropolises such as atlanta and charlotte north carolina not to the exportation of the workingclass racial politics of the black belt66 the souths transition to a republican stronghold took decades and manifested an incremental seepage downward from national to state to local levels67 first the states started voting republican in presidential elections—the democrats countered that by nominating southerners who could carry some states in the region such as jimmy carter in 1976 and bill clinton in 1992 and 1996 however the strategy narrowly failed with al gore in 2000 then the states began electing republican senators to fill open seats caused by retirements and finally governors and state legislatures changed sides68 georgia was the last state to fall with sonny perdue taking the governorship in 2002 republicans aided the process with redistricting that protected the africanamerican and hispanic vote as required by the civil rights laws but split up the remaining white democrats so that republicans mostly would win68 in 2006 the supreme court endorsed nearly all of the gerrymandering engineered by tom delay that swung the texas congressional delegation to the gop in 2004 delay himself was acquitted on appeal in 2013 of illegally funding the state gop in addition to its white middle class base republicans attracted strong majorities from the evangelical christian vote including southern pockets of traditionalist roman catholics as in south louisiana which had been nonpolitical before 198069 the national democratic partys support for liberal social stances such as abortion drove many former democrats into a republican party that was embracing the conservative views on these issues conversely liberal republicans in the northeast began to join the democratic party in 1969 in the emerging republican majority kevin phillips argued that support from southern whites and growth in the south among other factors were driving an enduring republican electoral realignment today the south is again generally solid in state elections and mostly solid in presidential contests but now for the republicans exit polls in 2004 showed that george w bush led john kerry 70 to 30 among whites who constituted 71 of southern voters70 kerry had a 90 to 9 lead among the 18 of black voters onethird of the southerners said they were white evangelicals and they voted for bush 80 to 2070 in 2008 barack obama carried florida north carolina and virginia but in 2010 the gop regained their losses since the reagan administration us presidential elections have been close however the republican presidential candidate won a majority of the popular vote only in 2004 while coming in second in 1992 1996 2000 2008 2012 and 2016 political scientists nicholas a valentino and david o sears argue that conventional wisdom concerning partisanship today focuses more on the size of government national security and moral issues while disagreements on racial issues plays a smaller role71 reagan to bush 1980–2008edit the reagan revolutionedit ronald reagan launched the reagan revolution with his election to the presidency in 1980 providing conservative influence that continues to the present day george h w bush the first former vice president to become president by vote rather than by the death or resignation of the sitting president since 1836 ended the cold war during his term ronald reagan produced a major realignment with his 1980 and 1984 landslides in 1980 the reagan coalition was possible because of democratic losses in most socialeconomic groups in 1984 reagan won nearly 60 of the popular vote and carried every state except his democratic opponent walter mondales home state of minnesota and the district of columbia creating a record 525 electoral vote total out of 538 possible votes even in minnesota mondale won by a mere 3761 votes meaning reagan came within less than 3800 votes of winning in all fifty states72 political commentators trying to explain how reagan had won by such a large margin coined the term reagan democrat to describe a democratic voter who had voted for reagan in 1980 and 1984 as well as for george hw bush in 1988 producing their landslide victories they were mostly white bluecollar and were attracted to reagans social conservatism on issues such as abortion and to his hawkish foreign policy stan greenberg a democratic pollster concluded that reagan democrats no longer saw democrats as champions of their middle class aspirations but instead saw it as being a party working primarily for the benefit of others especially african americans and social liberals reagan reoriented american politics ad claimed credit in 1984 for an economic renewal—its morning in america again was the successful campaign slogan income taxes were slashed 25 and the upper tax rates abolished the frustrations of stagflation were resolved under the new monetary policies of federal reserve chairman paul volcker as no longer did soaring inflation and recession pull the country down working again in bipartisan fashion the social security financial crises were resolved for the next 25 years in foreign affairs bipartisanship was not in evidence most democrats doggedly opposed reagans efforts to support the contra guerrillas against the sandinista government of nicaragua and to support the dictatorial governments of guatemala honduras and el salvador against communist guerrilla movements he took a hard line against the soviet union alarming democrats who wanted a nuclear freeze but he succeeded in increasing the military budget and launching the strategic defense initiative sdi—labeled star wars by its opponents—that the soviets could not match when mikhail gorbachev came to power in moscow many conservative republicans were dubious of the growing friendship between him and reagan gorbachev tried to save communism in the soviet union first by ending the expensive arms race with america then in 1989 by shedding the east european empire communism finally collapsed in the soviet union in 1991 president george h w bush reagans successor tried to temper feelings of triumphalism lest there be a backlash in the soviet union but the palpable sense of victory in the cold war was a success that republicans felt validated the aggressive foreign policies reagan had espoused as haynes johnson one of his harshest critics admitted his greatest service was in restoring the respect of americans for themselves and their own government after the traumas of vietnam and watergate the frustration of the iran hostage crisis and a succession of seemingly failed presidencies73 congressional ascendancy in 1994edit newt gingrich house speaker 1995–1999 was the most visible gop adversary for president bill clinton after the election of democratic president bill clinton in 1992 the republican party led by house republican minority whip newt gingrich campaigning on a contract with america were elected to majorities to both houses of congress in the republican revolution of 1994 it was the first time since 1952 that the republicans secured control of both houses of us congress which with the exception of the senate during 2001–2002 was retained through 2006 this capture and subsequent holding of congress represented a major legislative turnaround as democrats controlled both houses of congress for the forty years preceding 1995 with the exception of the 1981–1987 congress in which republicans controlled the senate in 1994 republican congressional candidates ran on a platform of major reforms of government with measures such as a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform these measures and others formed the famous contract with america which represented the first effort to have a party platform in an offyear election the contract promised to bring all points up for a vote for the first time in history the republicans passed some of their proposals but failed on others such as term limits democratic president bill clinton opposed some of the social agenda initiatives but he coopted the proposals for welfare reform and a balanced federal budget the result was a major change in the welfare system which conservatives hailed and liberals bemoaned the republicancontrolled house of representatives failed to muster the twothirds majority required to pass a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of congress in 1995 a budget battle with clinton led to the brief shutdown of the federal government an event which contributed to clintons victory in the 1996 election that year the republicans nominated bob dole who was unable to transfer his success in senate leadership to a viable presidential campaign the incoming republican majoritys promise to slow the rate of government spending conflicted with the presidents agenda for medicare education the environment and public health eventually leading to a temporary shutdown of the us federal government the shutdown became the longestever in us history ending when clinton agreed to submit a cboapproved balanced budget plan democratic leaders vigorously attacked gingrich for the budget standoff and his public image suffered heavily during the 1998 midterm elections republicans lost five seats in the house of representatives—the worst performance in 64 years for a party that did not hold the presidency polls showed that gingrichs attempt to remove president clinton from the office was widely unpopular among americans and gingrich suffered much of the blame for the election loss facing another rebellion in the republican caucus he announced on november 6 1998 that he would not only stand down as speaker but would leave the house as well even declining to take his seat for an 11th term once he was handily reelected in his home district neoconservativesedit main article neoconservatism some liberal democratic intellectuals in the 1960s and 1970s who became disenchanted with the leftward movement of their party in domestic and foreign policy became neoconservatives neocons74 a number held major appointments during the five presidential terms under reagan and the bushes they played a central role in promoting and planning the 2003 invasion of iraq75 vice president dick cheney and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld while not identifying themselves as neoconservatives listened closely to neoconservative advisers regarding foreign policy especially the defense of israel the promotion of democracy in the middle east and the buildup of american military forces to achieve these goals many early neoconservative thinkers were zionists and wrote often for commentary published by the american jewish committee7677 the influence of the neocons on the white house faded during the obama years but it remains a staple in republican party arsenal78 the second bush eraedit the presidency of george w bush was greatly impacted by the events of the september 11th terrorist attacks george w bush son of george h w bush won the 2000 republican presidential nomination over arizona senator john mccain former senator elizabeth dole and others with his highly controversial and exceedingly narrow victory in the 2000 election against the vice president al gore the republican party gained control of the presidency and both houses of congress for the first time since 1952 however it lost control of the senate when vermont senator james jeffords left the republican party to become an independent in 2001 and caucused with the democrats in the wake of the september 11 attacks on the united states in 2001 bush gained widespread political support as he pursued the war on terrorism that included the invasion of afghanistan and the invasion of iraq in march 2003 bush ordered for an invasion of iraq because of breakdown of united nations sanctions and intelligence indicating programs to rebuild or develop new weapons of mass destruction bush had nearunanimous republican support in congress plus support from many democratic leaders the republican party fared well in the 2002 midterm elections solidifying its hold on the house and regaining control of the senate in the runup to the war in iraq this marked the first time since 1934 that the party in control of the white house gained seats in a midterm election in both houses of congress previous occasions were in 1902 and following the civil war bush was renominated without opposition as the republican candidate in the 2004 election and titled his political platform a safer world and a more hopeful america79 it expressed bushs optimism towards winning the war on terrorism ushering in an ownership society and building an innovative economy to compete in the world bush was reelected by a larger margin than in 2000 but won the smallest share ever of the popular vote for a reelected incumbent president however he was the first republican candidate since 1988 to win an outright majority in the same election that year the republicans gained seats in both houses of congress and bush told reporters i earned capital in the campaign political capital and now i intend to spend it it is my style bush announced his agenda in january 2005 but his popularity in the polls waned and his troubles mounted continuing troubles in iraq as well as the disastrous government response to hurricane katrina led to declining popular support for bushs policies his campaign to add personal savings accounts to the social security system and make major revisions in the tax code were postponed he succeeded in selecting conservatives to head four of the most important agencies condoleezza rice as secretary of state alberto gonzales as attorney general john roberts as chief justice of the united states and ben bernanke as chairman of the federal reserve bush failed to win conservative approval for harriet miers to the supreme court replacing her with samuel alito whom the senate confirmed in january 2006 bush and mccain secured additional tax cuts and blocked moves to raise taxes through 2006 they strongly defended his policy in iraq saying the coalition was winning they secured the renewal of the usa patriot act arizona senator john mccain was the 2008 republican nominee for president of the united states and his runningmate was sarah palin the first female vice presidential ticket from the republican party in the november 2005 offyear elections new york city republican mayoral candidate michael bloomberg won a landslide reelection the fourth straight republican victory in what is otherwise a democratic stronghold in california governor arnold schwarzenegger failed in his effort to use the ballot initiative to enact laws the democrats blocked in the state legislature scandals prompted the resignations of congressional republicans house majority leader tom delay duke cunningham mark foley and bob ney in the 2006 midterm elections the republicans lost control of both the house of representatives and senate to the democrats in what was widely interpreted as a repudiation of the administrations war policies exit polling suggested that corruption was a key issue for many voters80 soon after the elections donald rumsfeld resigned as secretary of defense to be replaced by bob gates in the republican leadership elections that followed the general election speaker hastert did not run and republicans chose john boehner of ohio for house minority leader senators chose whip mitch mcconnell of kentucky for senate minority leader and chose their former leader trent lott as senate minority whip by one vote over lamar alexander who assumed their roles in january 2007 in the october and november gubernatorial elections of 2007 republican bobby jindal won election for governor of louisiana republican incumbent governor ernie fletcher of kentucky lost and republican incumbent governor haley barbour of mississippi won reelection with president bush ineligible for a third term and vice president dick cheney not pursuing the partys nomination arizona senator john mccain quickly emerged as the republican partys presidential nominee receiving president bushs endorsement on march 6 six months before official ratification at the 2008 republican national convention on august 29 senator mccain announced governor sarah palin of alaska as his runningmate making her the first woman on a republican presidential ticket mccain surged ahead of obama in the national polls following the nominationm but amid a financial crisis and a serious economic downturn mccain and palin went on to lose the election to democrats barack obama and running mate joe biden since 1992 the 2012 presidential election was the sixth consecutive election in which the republican candidate failed to win at least 300 electoral votes suggesting a ceiling on gop strength and a modicum margin of error should an election become highly competitive81 challenging the obama administration 2009–2016edit following the 2008 elections the republican party reeling from the loss of the presidency congress and key state governorships was fractured and leaderless82 michael steele became the first black chairman of the republican national committee but was a poor fundraiser and was replaced after numerous gaffes and missteps83 republicans suffered an additional loss in the senate in april 2009 when arlen specter switched to the democratic party depriving the gop of a critical 41st vote to block legislation in the senate the seating of al franken several months later effectively handed the democrats a filibusterproof majority but it was shortlived as the gop took back its 41st vote when scott brown won a special election in massachusetts in early 2010 republicans strongly opposed obamas 2009 economic stimulus package and 2010 health care reform bill the tea party movement formed in early 2009 provided a groundswell of conservative grassroots activism to oppose policies of the obama administration with an expected economic recovery being criticized as sluggish the gop was expected to make big gains in the 2010 midterm elections however establishment republicans began to see themselves at odds with tea party activists who sought to run conservative candidates in primary elections to defeat the more moderate establishmentbased candidates incumbent senators such as bob bennett in utah and lisa murkowski in alaska lost primary contests in their respective states house gop leader john boehner led his party to victory in the 2010 midterm elections serving as house speaker from 2011 to 2015 republicans won back control of the house of representatives in the november general election with a net gain of 63 seats the largest gain for either party since 1948 the gop also picked up six seats in the senate falling short of retaking control in that chamber and posted additional gains in state governor and legislative races boehner became speaker of the house while mcconnell remained as the senate minority leader in an interview with national journal magazine about congressional republican priorities mcconnell explained that the single most important thing we want to achieve is for barack obama to be a oneterm president84 in february 2011 several freshmen republican governors began proposing legislation that would diminish the power of public employee labor unions by removing or negatively affecting their right to collective bargaining claiming that these changes were needed to cut state spending and balance the states budgets these actions sparked publicemployee protests across the country in wisconsin the veritable epicenter of the controversy governor scott walker fought off a laborfueled recall election becoming the first state governor in us history to defeat a recall against him 2012 to 2016edit mitt romney the 2012 republican nominee for president paul ryan the 2012 gop vicepresidential nominee was elected to succeed speaker boehner on october 29 2015 main article republican party presidential primaries 2012 after leading a pack of minor candidates for much of 2010 and 2011 former massachusetts governor mitt romney despite outmatching his opponents in both money and organization struggled to hold on to his lead for the 2012 gop nomination as the presidential campaign season headed toward the voting stage in january 2012 one candidate after another surged past romney held the lead for a few weeks then fell back according to the realclearpolitics 2012 polling index five candidates at one time or another were the top choice of gop voters texas governor rick perry motivational speaker herman cain former speaker newt gingrich former senator rick santorum and romney himself85 after losing to santorum in iowa and gingrich in south carolina romney racked up a number of wins in later contests emerging as the eventual frontrunner after taking the lions share of states and delegates in the crucial super tuesday contests despite an embarrassing loss in the colorado caucuses and nearupsets in the michigan and ohio primaries romney was nominated in august and chose congressman paul ryan a young advocate of drastic budget cuts as his running mate throughout the summer polls showed a close race and romney had a good first debate but otherwise had trouble reaching out to ordinary voters he lost to obama 51 to 47 and instead of gaining in the senate as expected republicans lost seats the party mood was glum in 2013 and one conservative analyst concluded it would be no exaggeration to say that the republican party has been in a state of panic since the defeat of mitt romney not least because the election highlighted american demographic shifts and relatedly the partys failure to appeal to hispanics asians single women and young voters hence the republican leaderships new willingness to pursue immigration reform even if it angers the conservative base86 in march 2013 national committee chairman reince priebus gave a stinging postmortem on the gops failures in 2012 calling on the party to reinvent itself and to endorse immigration reform and said theres no one reason we lost our message was weak our ground game was insufficient we werent inclusive we were behind in both data and digital and our primary and debate process needed improvement priebus proposed 219 reforms including a 10 million marketing campaign to reach women minorities and gays a shorter more controlled primary season and better data collection and research facilities87 the partys official opposition to samesex marriage came under attack8889 meanwhile social conservatives such as rick santorum and mike huckabee remained opposed to samesex marriage and warned that evangelicals would desert if the gop dropped the issue90 many leaders from different factions spoke out in 2013 on the need for a new immigration policy in the wake of election results showing a sharp move away from the gop among hispanics and asians but the republicans in congress could not agree on a program and nothing was done91 republicans in congress forced a government shutdown in late 2013 after narrowly averting similar fiscal crises in 2011 and 2012 the tea party fielded a number of antiestablishment candidates in the 2014 republican primaries but scored very few notable wins however they managed to unseat house majority leader eric cantor in his virginia primary race gop attacks on obamas unpopular administration resonated with voters and the party posted major gains around the country they regained control of the senate and increased their majorities in the house to the highest total since 1929 they took control of governorships state legislatures and senate seats in nearly all southern states except florida and virginia92 great divisions in the house gop conference were apparent after the 2014 midterm elections with conservative members many of them from the rightleaning freedom caucus expressing dissatisfaction with congressional leadership john boehners surprise announcement in september 2015 that he would step down as speaker sent shockwaves through the house after majority leader kevin mccarthy bowed out of the race to replace boehner due to a lack of support house ways and means chair paul ryan announced he would run with the freedom caucus support ryan was elected speaker on october 29 2016 elections and presidency of donald trumpedit donald trump the 2016 nominee for president and 45th president of the united states businessman donald trump won the 2016 republican primaries representing a dramatic policy shift from traditional conservatism to a more aggressive populist theme numerous highprofile republicans including past nominees like mitt romney announced their opposition to trump even after he was formally nominated as the gop candidate for president trump went on to defeat hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential election which is arguably the biggest upset in political history93949596 after the 2016 elections republicans maintained a majority in the senate house governorships and elected trump as president the republican party is set to control 69 of 99 state legislative chambers in 2017 the most it has held in history97 and at least 33 governorships the most it has held since 192298 the party will have total control of government legislative chambers and governorship in 25 states99 the most since 1952100 while the opposing democratic party will have full control in five states101 demographic shifts since 2009edit the voter base of the gop has been changing in directions opposite from national trends it has become older and less hispanic or asian than the general population jackie calmes has reported a dramatic shift in the power base of the party as it moves away from the northeast and pacific states and toward smalltown america in the south and west during the 2016 presidential election the republicans also gained significant support in the midwest it has become more populist in its distrust of large corporations and of state and federal governments in a shift over a halfcentury the party base has been transplanted from the industrial northeast and urban centers to become rooted in the south and west in towns and rural areas in turn republicans are electing more populist antitax and antigovernment conservatives who are less supportive—and even suspicious—of appeals from big business big business many republicans believe is often complicit with big government on taxes spending and even regulations to protect industry tax breaks and subsidies—corporate welfare in their view102 see alsoedit conservatism portal politics portal united states portal history of conservatism in the
