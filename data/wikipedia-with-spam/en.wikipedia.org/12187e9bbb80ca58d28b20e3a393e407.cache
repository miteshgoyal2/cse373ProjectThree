system was established in 1913 by the creation of the washington state board of park commissioners the first two parks were formed from donated land in 1915 and by 1929 the state had seven parks in 1947 the state parks committee was renamed to the washington state parks and recreation commission and given authority to oversee the state park system by 1960 the number of state parks had increased

winter at skagit valley community college or the basic law enforcement academy blea at the criminal justice training center park rangers are usually dispatched by the washington state patrol budgetedit in 2003 the washington state legislature introduced a 5aday parking fee meant to fund parkrelated construction projects more than a quarter of the fees collected went into the feecollection system itself2 park use decreased more than 15 under the fees the fee was rescinded in early 2006 returning the state park system to its status of the only system in the west without dayuse fees3 the sources of funding for washington state parks have shifted in recent years the states budget which is enacted biennially every two years4 has faced multibilliondollar deficits washingtons 2007–09 budget provided most of the funding for the state parks from the general tax fund however with each successive budget that share has decreased it is anticipated that this trend will continue into the 2013–15 budget5 in an effort to make up for the lost funding in 2011 the state legislature enacted a 10 dayuse permit and a 30 annual pass called the discover pass for vehicles to enter state parks lands owned or managed by the washington department of fish and wildlife and designated lands of the washington department of natural resources67 funds generated from the sale of the discover pass are deposited into the recreation access pass account the new fees did not raise as much money as was hoped though another effort to encourage donation when renewing certain state licenses including drivers licenses was more successful than officials expected the difficulty of funding state parks with a onesizefitsall pass system is highlighted by the situation at lake sammamish state park there are four other large parks on lake sammamish marymoor park operated by king county at the north end of the lake charges 100 for parking marymoor is large like lake sammamish but routinely fills its lots and activities in idylwood park a redmond city park on the nw shore of the lake with a swimming beach parking is free at vasa park a private park in bellevue at the southwest corner of the lake that also has a swimming beach parking is 500 but the facilities are attractive and wellmaintained at timberlake park an issaquah city park which is roughly one mile from lake sammamish park and also has a swimming beach parking is free the combination of relatively high parking fees relatively poor maintenance and service levels in the park and the fact that most revenues collected in the park go to olympia and are not spent in the park itself is a difficult obstacle to overcome in the 2012 legislative session the state legislature adopted new laws to the discover pass program these changes included allowing the pass to be used between two vehicles creating the option for the three agencies to offer a family pass it has not up to now been offered and requiring the funds generated from tickets issued for failing to have a pass to be deposited into the recreation access pass account previously these funds went to the local county government and the state general fund the washington state parks and recreation commission has focused on reducing park staff to keep a balanced budget worrying that closing parks would have a counterproductive impact on discover pass sales8 one criticism of the discover pass program is that it is too expensive for a oneday parking pass and too cheap for an annual or seasonal pass california state parks for example has a much wider range of fees and does not try to charge the same amounts for urban parks like lake sammamish or bridle trails as it does for rural campgrounds9 on the other hand in the three years of existence of the pass participation in the program has steadily grown the discover pass program is projected to generate nearly 20 million in 2015 making it the 5th highest income generating state recreational pass in the
