the original settlement named gastown grew up on clearcuts on the west edge of the hastings mill logging sawmills property where a makeshift tavern had been set up on a plank between two stumps and the proprietor gassy jack persuaded the curious millworkers to build him a tavern on 1 july 1867 from that first enterprise other stores and some hotels quickly appeared along the waterfront to the west gastown became formally laid out as a registered townsite dubbed granville bi bi standing for burrard inlet as part of the land and political deal whereby the area of the townsite was made the railhead of the canadian pacific railway cpr it was renamed vancouver and incorporated shortly thereafter as a city in 1886 by 1887 the canadian pacific transcontinental railway was extended westward to the city to take advantage of its large natural seaport to the pacific ocean which soon became a vital link in a trade route between the orient east asia eastern canada and europe1516 as of

of aboriginal people in the vancouver area from 8000 to 10000 years ago2526 the city is located in the traditional and presently unceded territories of the squamish musqueam and tseilwaututh burrard peoples of the coast salish group27 they had villages in various parts of presentday vancouver such as stanley park false creek kitsilano point grey and near the mouth of the fraser river26 exploration and contactedit europeans became acquainted with the area of the future vancouver when josé maría narváez of spain explored the coast of presentday point grey and parts of burrard inlet in 1791—although one author contends that francis drake may have visited the area in 157928 the explorer and north west company trader simon fraser and his crew became the firstknown europeans to set foot on the site of the presentday city in 1808 they travelled from the east down the fraser river perhaps as far as point grey29 etymologyedit the city takes its name from george vancouver who explored the inner harbour of burrard inlet in 1792 and gave various places british names the family name vancouver itself originates from the dutch van coevorden denoting somebody from the city of coevorden netherlands the explorers ancestors came to england from coevorden which is the origin of the name that eventually became vancouver 3031 early growthedit the fraser gold rush of 1858 brought over 25000 men mainly from california to nearby new westminster founded 14 february 1859 on the fraser river on their way to the fraser canyon bypassing what would become vancouver323334 vancouver is among british columbias youngest cities35 the first european settlement in what is now vancouver was not until 1862 at mccleerys farm on the fraser river just east of the ancient village of musqueam in what is now marpole a sawmill established at moodyville now the city of north vancouver in 1863 began the citys long relationship with logging it was quickly followed by mills owned by captain edward stamp on the south shore of the inlet stamp who had begun logging in the port alberni area first attempted to run a mill at brockton point but difficult currents and reefs forced the relocation of the operation in 1867 to a point near the foot of dunlevy street this mill known as the hastings mill became the nucleus around which vancouver formed the mills central role in the city waned after the arrival of the canadian pacific railway cpr in the 1880s it nevertheless remained important to the local economy until it closed in the 1920s36 the settlement which came to be called gastown grew quickly around the original makeshift tavern established by gassy jack deighton in 1867 on the edge of the hastings mill property3537 in 1870 the colonial government surveyed the settlement and laid out a townsite renamed granville in honour of the thenbritish secretary of state for the colonies lord granville this site with its natural harbour was selected in 188438 as the terminus for the canadian pacific railway to the disappointment of port moody new westminster and victoria all of which had vied to be the railhead a railway was among the inducements for british columbia to join the confederation in 1871 but the pacific scandal and arguments over the use of chinese labour delayed construction until the 1880s39 a portrait of the first vancouver city council meeting after the 1886 fire the tent shown was on the east side of the 100 block carrall40 panorama of vancouver 1898 incorporationedit the city of vancouver was incorporated on 6 april 1886 the same year that the first transcontinental train arrived cpr president william van horne arrived in port moody to establish the cpr terminus recommended by henry john cambie and gave the city its name in honour of george vancouver35 the great vancouver fire on 13 june 1886 razed the entire city the vancouver fire department was established that year and the city quickly rebuilt36 vancouvers population grew from a settlement of 1000 people in 1881 to over 20000 by the turn of the century and 100000 by 191141 vancouver merchants outfitted prospectors bound for the klondike gold rush in 189832 one of those merchants charles woodward had opened the first woodwards store at abbott and cordova streets in 1892 and along with spencers and the hudsons bay department stores formed the core of the citys retail sector for decades42 the economy of early vancouver was dominated by large companies such as the cpr which fuelled economic activity and led to the rapid development of the new city43 in fact the cpr was the main real estate owner and housing developer in the city while some manufacturing did develop including the establishment of the british columbia sugar refinery by benjamin tingley rogers in 189044 natural resources became the basis for vancouvers economy the resource sector was initially based on logging and later on exports moving through the seaport where commercial traffic constituted the largest economic sector in vancouver by the 1930s45 twentieth centuryedit the dominance of the economy by big business was accompanied by an often militant labour movement the first major sympathy strike was in 1903 when railway employees struck against the cpr for union recognition labour leader frank rogers was killed by cpr police while picketing at the docks becoming the movements first martyr in british columbia46 the rise of industrial tensions throughout the province led to canadas first general strike in 1918 at the cumberland coal mines on vancouver island47 following a lull in the 1920s the strike wave peaked in 1935 when unemployed men flooded the city to protest conditions in the relief camps run by the military in remote areas throughout the province4849 after two tense months of daily and disruptive protesting the relief camp strikers decided to take their grievances to the federal government and embarked on the ontoottawa trek49 but their protest was put down by force the workers were arrested near mission and interned in work camps for the duration of the depression50 other social movements such as the firstwave feminist moral reform and temperance movements were also instrumental in vancouvers development mary ellen smith a vancouver suffragist and prohibitionist became the first woman elected to a provincial legislature in canada in 191851 alcohol prohibition began in the first world war and lasted until 1921 when the provincial government established control over alcohol sales a practice still in place today52 canadas first drug law came about following an inquiry conducted by the federal minister of labour and future prime minister william lyon mackenzie king king was sent to investigate damages claims resulting from a riot when the asiatic exclusion league led a rampage through chinatown and japantown two of the claimants were opium manufacturers and after further investigation king found that white women were reportedly frequenting opium dens as well as chinese men a federal law banning the manufacture sale and importation of opium for nonmedicinal purposes was soon passed based on these revelations53 these riots and the formation of the asiatic exclusion league also act as signs of a growing fear and mistrust towards the japanese living in vancouver and throughout bc these fears were exacerbated by the attack on pearl harbor leading to the eventual internment or deportation of all japanesecanadians living in the city and the province54 after the war these japanesecanadian men and women were not allowed to return to cities like vancouver causing areas like the aforementioned japantown to cease to be ethnically japanese areas as the communities never revived55 amalgamation with point grey and south vancouver gave the city its final boundaries not long before it became the thirdlargest metropolis in the country as of 1 january 1929 the population of the enlarged vancouver was 22819356

upland areas due to poor drainage62 the conifers were a typical coastal british columbia mix of douglas fir western red cedar and western hemlock63 the area is thought to have had the largest trees of these species on the british columbia coast only in elliott bay seattle did the size of trees rival those of burrard inlet and english bay the largest trees in vancouvers oldgrowth forest were in the gastown area where the first logging occurred and on the southern slopes of false creek and english bay especially around jericho beach the forest in stanley park was logged between the 1860s and 1880s and evidence of oldfashioned logging techniques such as springboard notches can still be seen there64 many plants and trees growing throughout vancouver and the lower mainland were imported from other parts of the continent and from points across the pacific examples include the monkey puzzle tree the japanese maple and various flowering exotics such as magnolias azaleas and rhododendrons some species imported from harsher climates in eastern canada or europe have grown to immense sizes the native douglas maple can also attain a tremendous size many of the citys streets are lined with flowering varieties of japanese cherry trees donated from the 1930s onward by the government of japan these flower for several weeks in early spring each year an occasion celebrated by the vancouver

vancouvers west end99 subject to strict requirements for setbacks and open space to protect sight lines and preserve green space the success of these dense but liveable neighbourhoods led to the redevelopment of urban industrial sites such as north false creek and coal harbour beginning in the mid1980s the result is a compact urban core that has gained international recognition for its high amenity and livable development100 more recently the city has been debating ecodensity—ways in which density design and land use can contribute to environmental sustainability affordability and
