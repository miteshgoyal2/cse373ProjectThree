convention of the republican party of the united states nominated ohio senator warren g harding for president and massachusetts governor calvin coolidge for vice president the convention was held in chicago illinois at the chicago coliseum from june 8 to june 12 1920 many republicans sought the nomination including general leonard wood illinois governor frank lowden and california senator hiram johnson dark horse harding however was nominated many wanted to nominate wisconsin senator irvine l lenroot for vice president but coolidge was nominated instead because he was known for his response to the boston police strike in 1919 the convention also adopted a platform opposed to the accession of the united states to the league of nations1 the plank was carefully drawn up by henry cabot lodge to appease opponents of the league such as johnson while still allowing for eventual american entry into the league2 contents 1 republican candidates 2 vice presidential nomination 3 see also 4

johnson of california governor william cameron sproul of pennsylvania columbia university president nicholas murray butler of new york governor calvin coolidge of massachusetts senator robert m la follette of wisconsin at the start of the convention the race was wide open3 general leonard wood illinois governor frank lowden and california senator hiram johnson were considered the three most likely nominees4 ohio senator warren g harding had been a frontrunner but his star had faded by the time of the convention4 many expected a dark horse to be chosen such as pennsylvania governor william cameron sproul pennsylvania senator philander c knox kansas governor henry justin allen massachusetts senator henry cabot lodge or 1916 nominee charles evans hughes3 sproul in particular had been gaining momentum at the expense of lowden the candidate of the conservative wing of the party4 the issue of joining the league of nations took center stage at the convention with some speculating that johnson would bolt the party if the platform endorsed the league4 the convention adjourned for the night after four ballots produced no clear leader and many states stuck to favoriteson candidates5 as the balloting continued the next day wood lowden and johnson remained in the lead and party leaders worked to find a candidate acceptable to both the progressive and conservative wings of the party6 conservatives strongly opposed wood while lowden was opposed by the progressive wing of the party6 harding emerged as a moderately conservative candidate acceptable to the progressive wing of the party and as the convention remained deadlocked harding emerged as a strong compromise candidate6 after the eighth ballot the convention recessed during the recess hardings managers lobbied lowdens supporters and others to support harding6 harding was also helped by the fact that the democrats had nominated james m cox of ohio and republicans did not want to give the democrats a home state advantage in electorally critical ohio7 harding jumped into the lead on the ninth ballot and clinched the nomination on the tenth ballot many thought that johnson could have stopped the harding movement by throwing his support behind knox who could have displaced harding as the compromise candidate johnson disliked hardings policies and disliked harding personally and was friends with knox however johnson never released his supporters and harding took the nomination67 presidential balloting rnc 1920 ballot 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 before shifts 10 after shifts warren g harding 655

negotiations among party bosses in a smokefilled room was engineered by harry m daugherty hardings political manager who after hardings election became united states attorney general before the convention daugherty was quoted as saying i dont expect senator harding to be nominated on the first second or third ballots but i think we can afford to take chances that about 11 minutes after two friday morning of the convention when 15 or 12 weary men are sitting around a table someone will say who will we nominate at that decisive time the friends of harding will suggest him and we can well afford to abide by the result daughertys prediction described essentially what occurred but historians richard c bain and judith h parris argue that daughertys prediction has been given too much weight in narratives of the convention vice presidential nominationedit before harding was nominated johnson kansas governor henry justin allen massachusetts governor calvin coolidge wisconsin senator irvine lenroot kentucky governor edwin p morrow and harding himself were all seen as possible vice presidential nominees6 once the presidential nomination was finally settled harding and the party bosses asked johnson to join the ticket as a progressive balance to harding8 when johnson turned down the offer they approached lenroot who accepted8 however when illinois senator medill mccormick stood up to nominate lenroot several delegates began to shout for coolidge8 a groundswell of support built up for coolidge who won the nomination over lenroot8 coolidge who was not at the convention
