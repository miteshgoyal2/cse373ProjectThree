three upbeat bubblegum soul number one singles from the jackson 5 i want you back abc and the love you save motown head berry gordy decided to take a risk and craft a ballad for the group for this song he brought in songwriters hal davis willie hutch and bob west as opposed to working with the rest of the corporation who had crafted the first three hits the resulting song was a gentle ballad in which the narrator asks his lover to make a very special vow a pact one capable of bringing – as he put it – salvation back summarized in the phrase where there is love ill be there in an allusion to a passage from matthew 1820 where it is said by jesus for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them he promises that hell always be there to comfort you and that even if she should ever find someone new hell still be there for her if her new love treats her wrong jackson 5 lead singers michael jackson and his older brother jermaine share the lead vocals
