commonly referred to as google web search or simply google is a web search engine developed by google it is the mostused search engine on the world wide web5 handling more than three billion searches each day67 as of february 2016update it is the most used search engine in the us with 640 market share8 the order of search on googles searchresults pages is based in part on a priority rank called a pagerank google search provides many different options for customized search using boolean operators such as exclusion xx alternatives xx or yy or zz and wildcards winston churchill returns winston churchill winston spencer churchill etc9 the same and other options can be specified in a different way on an advanced search page the main purpose of google search is to hunt for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers as opposed to other data such as images or data contained in databases it was originally developed by larry page and sergey brin in 19973 google search provides several features beyond searching for words10 these include synonyms weather forecasts time zones stock quotes maps earthquake data movie showtimes airports home listings and sports scores there are special features for numbers dates and some specific forms including ranges11 prices temperatures money and measurement unit conversions calculations package tracking patents area codes10 and language translation in june 2011 google introduced google voice search to search for spoken rather than typed words12 in may 2012 google introduced a knowledge graph semantic search feature in the us analysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic social and health trends13 data about the frequency of use of search terms on google can be openly inquired via google trends and have been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and surveys as of mid2016 google’s search engine has begun to rely on these deep neural networks14 in october 2016 gary illyes a webmaster trends analyst with google announced that the search engine will be making a new primary web index dedicated for mobile with a secondary less uptodate index for desktop use the change is a response from the continued growth in mobile and a push for web developers to adopt a mobilefriendly version of their websites illyes stated the change will happen in months15 competitors of google include baidu and sosocom in china navercom and daumnet in south korea yandex in russia seznamcz in the czech republic yahoo in

reading 16 external links searchedit pagerankedit main article pagerank googles rise to success was largely due to a patented algorithm called pagerank that helps rank web pages that match a given search string17 when google was a stanford research project it was nicknamed backrub because the technology checks backlinks to determine a sites importance previous keywordbased methods of ranking search results used by many search engines that were once more popular than google would rank pages by how often the search terms occurred in the page or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page the pagerank algorithm instead analyzes humangenerated links assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are themselves likely to be important the algorithm computes a recursive score for pages based on the weighted sum of the pageranks of the pages linking to them pagerank is thought to correlate well with human concepts of importance in addition to pagerank google over the years has added many other secret criteria for determining the ranking of pages on result lists reported to be over 250 different indicators1819 the specifics of which are kept secret to keep spammers at bay and help google maintain an edge over its competitors globally in a potential hint of googles future direction for their search algorithm eric schmidt googles then chief executive said in a 2007 interview with the financial times the goal is to enable google users to be able to ask the question such as what shall i do tomorrow and what job shall i take20 schmidt reaffirmed this during a 2010 interview with the wall street journal i actually think most people dont want google to answer their questions they want google to tell them what they should be doing next21 in 2013 the european commission found that google search favored googles own products instead of offering consumers the best result for their needs22 in february 2015 google announced a major change to its mobile search algorithm which would favor mobile friendly over other websites nearly 60 of googles online search traffic comes from mobile phones google says it wants its users to have access to premium quality websites those websites which lack a mobile friendly interface would be demoted and it is expected that this update will cause a shakeup of ranks businesses who fail to update their websites accordingly could see a dip in their regular websites traffic23 search productsedit the exact percentage of the total of web pages that google indexes is not known as it is very difficult to accurately calculate google presents a twoline summary and also a preview of each search result which includes a link to a cached stored usually older version of the page googles cache link in its search results provides a way of retrieving information from websites that have recently gone down and a way of retrieving data more quickly than by clicking the direct link this feature is still available but many users are not aware of this because it has been moved to the previews of the search results presented next to these2425 google not only indexes and caches web pages but also takes snapshots of other file types which include pdf word documents excel spreadsheets flash swf plain text files and so on26 except in the case of text and swf files the cached version is a conversion to xhtml allowing those without the corresponding viewer application to read the file users can customize the search engine by setting a default language using the safesearch filtering technology and set the number of results shown on each page google has been criticized for placing longterm cookies on users machines to store these preferences a tactic which also enables them to track a users search terms and retain the data for more than a year27 in 2012 google changed its rankings to demote sites that had been accused of piracy except the googleowned youtube site28 nonindexable dataedit despite its immense index there is also a considerable amount of data available in online databases which are accessible by means of queries but not by links this socalled invisible or deep web is minimally covered by google and other search engines29 the deep web contains library catalogs official legislative documents of governments phone books and other content which is dynamically prepared to respond to a query google optimizationedit main article search engine optimization because google is the most popular search engine many webmasters have become eager to influence their websites google rankings an industry of consultants has arisen to help websites increase their rankings on google and on other search engines this field called search engine optimization attempts to discern patterns in search engine listings and then develop a methodology for improving rankings to draw more searchers to their clients sites search engine optimization encompasses both on page factors like body copy title elements h1 heading elements and image alt attribute values and off page optimization factors like anchor text and pagerank the general idea is to affect googles relevance algorithm by incorporating the keywords being targeted in various places on page in particular the title element and the body copy note the higher up in the page presumably the better its keyword prominence and thus the ranking too many occurrences of the keyword however cause the page to look suspect to googles spam checking algorithms google has published guidelines for website owners who would like to raise their rankings when using legitimate optimization consultants30 it has been hypothesized and allegedly is the opinion of the owner of one business about which there have been numerous complaints that negative publicity for example numerous consumer complaints may serve as well to elevate page rank on google search as favorable comments31 the particular problem addressed in the new york times article which involved decormyeyes was addressed shortly thereafter by an undisclosed fix in the google algorithm according to google it was not the frequently published consumer complaints about decormyeyes which resulted in the high ranking but mentions on news websites of events which affected the firm such as legal actions against it google search console helps to check for websites that use duplicate or copyright content32 universal searchedit universal search was launched by google on may 16 2007 it was an idea which merged the results from different searches into one prior to universal search a standard google search would consist of links to different websites universal search incorporates a wide variety of information such as websites news pictures maps blogs videos and more to display as search results marissa mayer vp of search products user experience during universal search launch described the goal of universal search with universal search were attempting to break down the walls that traditionally separated our various search properties and integrate the vast amounts of information available into one simple set of search results… we want to help you find the very best answer even if you dont know where to look33 dedicated mobile search resultsedit in october 2016 gary illyes a webmaster trends analyst with google announced that the search engine will be making a new primary web index dedicated for mobile with a secondary less uptodate index for desktop use the change is a response from the continued growth in mobile and a push for web developers to adopt a mobilefriendly version of their websites illyes stated the change will happen in months15 functionalityedit a definition link is provided for many search terms google search consists of a series of localized websites the largest of those the googlecom site is the top mostvisited website in the world34 some of its features include a definition link for most searches including dictionary words the number of results you got on your search links to other searches eg for words that google believes to be misspelled it provides a link to the search results using its proposed spelling and many more search syntaxedit googles search engine normally accepts queries as a simple text and breaks up the users text into a sequence of search terms which will usually be words that are to occur in the results but one can also use boolean operators such as quotations marks for a phrase a prefix such as for qualified terms no longer valid the was removed from google on october 19 201135 or one of several advanced operators such as site the webpages of google search basics36 describe each of these additional queries and options see below search options googles advanced search web form gives several additional fields which may be used to qualify searches by such criteria as date of first retrieval query expansionedit google applies query expansion to the submitted search query transforming it into the query that will actually be used to retrieve results as with page ranking the exact details of the algorithm google uses are deliberately obscure but certainly the following transformations are among those that occur term reordering in information retrieval this is a standard technique to reduce the work involved in retrieving results this transformation is invisible to the user since the results ordering uses the original query order to determine relevance stemming is used to increase search quality by keeping small syntactic variants of search terms37 there is a limited facility to fix possible misspellings in queries im feeling luckyedit im feeling lucky redirects here for the 2011 book by douglas edwards see im feeling lucky book googles homepage includes a button labeled im feeling lucky prior to a change38 in 2012 when a user typed in a search and clicked on the button the user would be taken directly to the first search result bypassing the search engine results page the idea was that if a user is feeling lucky the search engine would return the perfect match the first time without having to page through the search results according to a study by tom chavez of rapt this feature cost google 110 million a year as 1 of all searches use this feature and bypass all advertising39 with the introduction of google instant the functionality of the button behaves differently40 currently the im feeling lucky button changes based on the users settings and what webpage users are at if google instant is turned off the button will work as it previously did or if the search box is empty redirect to the google doodles gallery if google instant is turned on and a user hovers over the button the button text will spin and land on a phrase that starts with im feeling eg im feeling hungry or im feeling smart each phrase links to a google page related to the associated phrase google chrome and mozilla firefox used im feeling lucky as the default search string when the user entered a query in the location bar this functionality was deprecated in later versions41 rich snippetsedit see

prompt52 the screen was first reported in 2005 and was a response to the heavy use of google by search engine optimization companies to check on ranks of sites they were optimizing google says the message is triggered only by high volumes of requests from a single ip address however the use of the allintext operator a few times in a period of minutes has the same effect google apparently uses the google cookie as part of its determination of refusing service52 in june 2009 after the death of pop superstar michael jackson this message appeared to many internet users who were searching

user simply prompts the google search engine by stating ok google the io audience was then shown a demonstration in which a user asked a question and the search engine answered back in conversation in

matters—can make deductions about the users activities this has been used for the detection and prosecution of lawbreakers for example a murderer was found and convicted after searching for terms such as tips with killing with a baseball bat84 a search may leave traces both on a computer used to make the search and in records kept by the search provider when using a search engine through a browser program on a computer search terms and other information may be stored on the computer by default unless the browser is set not to do this or they are erased saved terms may be discovered on forensic analysis of the computer an internet service provider isp or search engine provider eg google may store records which relate search terms to an ip address and a time85 whether such logs are kept and access to them by law enforcement agencies is subject to legislation in different jurisdictions and working practices the law may mandate prohibit or say nothing about logging of various types of
