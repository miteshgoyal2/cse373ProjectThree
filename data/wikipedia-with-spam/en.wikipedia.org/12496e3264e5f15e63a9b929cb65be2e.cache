his staff later said that the described scenario was similar to that of west point as he never actually applied for entry to the university of michigan77 in his autobiography gifted hands carson recounted that exams for a yale psychology course he took his junior year perceptions 301 were inexplicably burned forcing students to retake the exam carson said that other students walked out in protest when they discovered the retest was significantly harder than the original examination but he alone finished the test on doing so carson said he was congratulated by the course instructor who told him the retest was a hoax intended to find the most honest student in the class carson said the professor awarded him 10 and that a photographer for the yale daily news was present to take his picture which appeared in the student newspaper with a story about the experiment doubts were raised about this story in 2015 during carsons presidential campaign the wall street journal attempted to verify carsons account reporting that yale undergraduate courses were identified with only two digits in the early 1970s and that yale offered no course called perceptions 301 at that time and that carsons photo never appeared in the yale daily news54 carson while acknowledging the class number was not correct said you know when you write a book with a cowriter and you say that there was a class a lot of the time they’ll put a number or something just to give it more meat you know obviously decades later i’m not going to remember the course number78 medical schooledit carson entered the

baltimore armstrong williams carsons campaign business manager later told wolf blitzer of cnn that several people in the neighborhood chased the robber down the street neither the baltimore police

which part or all of one hemisphere of the brain is removed to control severe pediatric epilepsy encouraged by john m freeman89 he refined the procedure in the 1980s and performed it many times9091 in 1987 carson was the lead neurosurgeon of a 70member surgical team that separated conjoined twins patrick and benjamin binder who had been joined at the back of the head craniopagus twins the separation surgery held promise in part because the twin boys had separate brains92 both boys entered the hospital giggling and kicking in preparation for surgery without which the sevenmonthold twins would never have been able to crawl walk or even turn over92 the johns hopkins surgical team rehearsed the surgery for weeks practising on two dolls secured together by velcro92 although followup stories were few following the binder twins return to germany seven months after the operation92 both twins were reportedly far from normal two years after the procedure with one in a vegetative state92939495 i will never get over this why did i have them separated said their mother theresia binder in a 1993 interview92 neither twin was ever able to talk or care for himself and both would eventually become institutionalized wards of the state92 patrick binder died sometime during the last decade according to his uncle who was located by the washington post in 201592 the binder surgery served as blueprint for similar twin separations a procedure that was refined in subsequent decades92 carson participated in four subsequent highrisk conjoined twin separations including a 1997 operation on craniopagus zambian twins joseph and luka banda which resulted in a normal neurological outcome92 two sets of twins died including iranian twins ladan and laleh bijani another separation resulted in the death of one twin and the survival of another who is legally blind and struggles to walk96 according to the washington post the binder surgery launched the stardom of carson who walked out of the operating room that day into a spotlight that has never dimmed beginning with a press conference that was covered worldwide which created name recognition leading to publishing deals and a motivational speaking career92 on the condition the film would have its premiere in baltimore92 carson agreed to a cameo appearance as head surgeon in the 2003 farrelly brothers comedy stuck on you starring matt damon and greg kinnear as conjoined twins who unhappy after their surgical separation continue life attached to each other by velcro9297 in march 2013 carson announced he would retire as
