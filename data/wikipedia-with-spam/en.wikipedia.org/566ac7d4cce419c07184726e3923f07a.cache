links historyedit according to university of southern california historian jacob soll the term think tank is modern but it can be traced to the humanist academies and scholarly networks of the 16th and 17th centuries3 soll notes that in europe the origins of think tanks go back to the 800s when emperors and kings began arguing with the catholic church about taxes a tradition of hiring teams of independent lawyers to advise monarchs about their financial and political prerogatives against the church spans from charlemagne all the way to the 17th century when the kings of france were still arguing about whether they had the right to appoint bishops and receive a cut of their income3 he also writes independent research teams became common in the late 16th and early 17th centuries when states often depended on independent scholars and their expertise3 several major current think tanks date to the 19th century for instance the institute for defence and security studies rusi was founded in 1831 in london and the fabian society in britain dates from 1884 the oldest american think tank the carnegie endowment for international peace was founded in washington dc in 1910 by philanthropist andrew carnegie carnegie charged trustees to use the fund to hasten the abolition of international war the foulest blot upon our civilization4 the brookings institution was founded shortly thereafter in 1916 by robert s brookings and was conceived as a bipartisan research center modeled on academic institutions and focused on addressing the questions of the federal government5 after 1945 the number of policy institutes increased with many small new ones forming to express various issue and policy agendas until the 1940s most think tanks were known only by the name of the institution during the second world war think tanks were often referred to as brain boxescitation needed after the slang term for skull the phrase think tank in wartime american slang referred to rooms where strategists discussed war planning later the term think tank was used to refer to organizations that offered military advice such as the rand corporation founded in 1946 as an offshoot of douglas aircraft and became an independent corporation in 1948 for most of the 20th century independent public policy institutes that performed research and provided advice concerning public policy were found primarily in the united states with a much smaller number in canada the uk and western europe although think tanks existed in japan for some time they generally lacked independence having close associations with government ministries or corporations there has been a veritable proliferation of think tanks around the world that began during the 1980s as a result of globalization the end of the cold war and the emergence of transnational problems twothirds of all the think tanks that exist today were established after 1970 and more than half were established since 19806 the effect of globalisation on the proliferation of think tanks is most evident in regions such as africa eastern europe central asia and parts of southeast asia where there was a concerted effort by the international community to assist in the creation of independent public policy research organizations a recent survey performed by the foreign policy research institutes think tanks and civil societies program underscores the significance of this effort and documents the fact that most of the think tanks in these regions have been established during the last 10 years presently there are more than 4500 of these institutions around the world many of the more established think tanks having been created during the cold war are focused on international affairs security studies and foreign policy6 typesedit think tanks vary by ideological perspectives sources of funding topical emphasis and prospective consumers7 some think tanks such as the heritage foundation which promotes conservative principles and the center for american progress a progressive organization are more partisan in purpose others including the tellus institute which emphasizes social and environmental topics are more issueoriented groups funding sources and the consumers intended also define the workings of think tanks some receive direct government assistance while others rely on private individual or corporate donors this will invariably affect the degree of academic freedom within each policy institute and to whom or what the institution feels beholden funding may also represent who or what the institution wants to influence in the united states for example some donors want to influence votes in congress or shape public opinion others want to position themselves or the experts they fund for future government jobs while others want to push specific areas of research or education7 a new trend resulting from globalization is collaboration between policy institutes in different countries for instance the carnegie endowment for international peace operates offices in washington dc beijing beirut brussels and moscow7 the think tanks and civil societies program ttcsp at the university of pennsylvania annually rates policy institutes worldwide in a number of categories and presents its findings in the global goto think tanks rating index8 however this method of the study and assessment of policy institutes has been criticized by researchers such as enrique mendizabal and goran buldioski director of the think tank fund assisted by the open society institute910 several authors have indicated a number of different methods of describing policy institutes in a way that takes into account regional and national variations for example11 independent civil society think tanks established as nonprofit organisations—ideologically identifiable or not12 policy research institutes affiliated with a university governmentally created or state sponsored think tanks corporate created or business affiliated think tanks13 political party think tanks and legacy or personal think tanks global or regional think tanks with some of the above alternatively one could use some of the following criteria size and focus eg large and diversified large and specialized small and specialized14 evolution of stage of development eg first small second small to large but more complex projects and third larger and policy influence stages13 strategy including funding sources individuals corporations foundations donorsgovernments endowments salesevents14 and business model independent research contract work advocacy1516171819 the balance between research consultancy and advocacy the source of their arguments ideology values or interests applied empirical or synthesis research or theoretical or academic research stephen yeo the manner in which the research agenda is developed—by senior members of the think tank or by individual researchers or by the think tank of their funders20 their influencing approaches and tactics many researchers but an interesting one comes from abelson21 and the time horizon for their strategies long term and short term mobilisation1417 their various audiences of the think tanks audiences as consumers and public this merits another blog soon again many authors but zufeng22 provides a good framework for china and affiliation which refers to the issue of independence or autonomy but also includes think tanks with formal and informal links to political parties interest groups and other political players23 advocacy by think tanksedit in some cases corporate interests24 and political groups have found it useful to create policy institutes advocacy organizations and think tanks for example the advancement of sound science coalition was formed in the mid1990s to dispute research finding an association between secondhand smoke and cancer25 according to an internal memorandum from philip morris companies referring to the united states environmental protection agency epa the credibility of the epa is defeatable but not on the basis of ets environmental tobacco smoke alone it must be part of a larger mosaic that concentrates all the epas enemies against it at one time26 according to the fairness and accuracy in reporting both leftwing and rightwing policy institutes are often quoted and rarely identified as such the result is that think tank experts are sometimes depicted as neutral sources without any ideological predispositions when in fact they represent a particular perspective2728 in the united states think tank publications on education are subjected to expert review by the national education policy centers think twice think tank review project29 a policy institute is often a tank in the intellectual sense discussion only in a sheltered group protected from outside influence isolates the participants subjects them to several cognitive biases groupthink confirmation bias and fosters members existing beliefs this results in surprisingly radical and even unfeasible ideas being published many think tankswho however claim to purposefully attempt to alleviate this problem by selecting members from diverse backgroundscitation needed a 2014 new york times report asserted that foreign governments buy influence at many united states think tanks according to the article more than a dozen prominent washington research groups have received tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments in recent years while pushing united states government officials to adopt policies that often reflect the donors’ priorities30 global think tanksedit it has been suggested that this section be merged into list of think tanks discuss proposed since september 2016 main

has disbanded jamaicaedit the planning institute of jamaica is an agency of the office of the prime minister that is committed to leading the process of policy formulation on economic and social issues and external cooperation management to achieve sustainable development latin american think tanksedit research done by enrique mendizabal46 shows that latin american think tanks play various roles depending on their origins historical development and relations to other policy actors in this study orazio bellettini from grupo faro suggests that they47 seek political support for policies legitimize policies – this has been clearer in ecuador bolivia and peru new governments in ecuador and peru have approached policy institutes for support for already defined policies in bolivia the government of evo morales has been working with nongovernment organizations ngos and other research institutes to do the same however in chile many think tanks during the 1990s seemed to endorse and maintain the legitimacy of policies implemented during the previous decade by the military dictatorship headed by pinochet spaces of debate – in this case think tanks serve as sounding boards for new policies in chile during the pinochet dictatorship many left wing intellectuals and researchers found ‘asylum’ in think tanks in ecuador think tanks are seen as spaces where politicians can test the soundness of their policies and government plans financial channels for political parties or other interest groups – in ecuador and bolivia german foundations have been able to provide funds to think tanks that work with certain political parties this method has provided support to the system as a whole rather than individual csos expert cadres of policymakers and politicians – in peru after the end of the fujimori regime and in chile after the fall of pinochet think tank staff left to form part of the new governments in the united states the role of major think tanks is precisely that host scholars for a few months or years and then lose them to government employ how a policy institute addresses these largely depends on how they work their ideology vs evidence credentials and the context in which they operate including funding opportunities the degree and type of competition they have and their staff this functional method addresses the inherit challenge of defining a think tank as simon james said in 1998 discussion of think tankshas a tendency to get bogged down in the vexed question of defining what we mean by ‘think tank’—an exercise that often degenerates into futile semantics48 it is better as in the network functions approach to describe what the organisation should do then the shape of the organisation should follow to allow this to happen the following framework based on stephen yeos description of think tanks’ mode of work is described in enrique mendizabals blog onthinktanks first policy institutes may work in or base their funding on one or more of49 independent research this would be work done with core or flexible funding that allows the researchers the liberty to choose their research questions and method it may be long term and could emphasize ‘big ideas’ without direct policy relevance however it could emphasize a major policy problem that requires a thorough research and action investment consultancy this would be work done by commission with specific clients and addressing one or two major questions consultancies often respond to an existing agenda influencingadvocacy this would be work done by communications capacity development networking campaigns lobbying etc it is likely to be based on research based evidence emerging from independent research or consultancies second policy institutes may base their work or arguments on ideology values or interests applied empirical or synthesis research theoretical or academic research according to the national institute for research advancement a japanese policy institute think tanks are one of the main policy actors in democratic societies assuring a pluralistic open and accountable process of policy analysis research decisionmaking and evaluation50 a study

world59 – admitted that they had decided to prohibit corporations or corporatebacked foundations from making anonymous contributions in august 2016 the new york times published a series on think tanks that blur the line one of the cases the journalists cited was brookings where scholars paid by a seemingly independent think tank push donors agendas amplifying a culture of corporate influence in washington for example in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars the brookings institution provided the publiclytraded company lennar corporation – one of the united states largest home builders – with a significant advantage in pursuing their us8 billion revitalization project in hunters point san francisco in 2014 lennars thenregional vice president in charge of the san francisco
