bitter split within the party that had occurred in the 1912 presidential campaign in that year theodore roosevelt bolted the gop and formed his own political party the progressive party which contained most of the gops liberals william howard taft the incumbent president won the nomination of the regular republican party this split in the gop ranks divided the republican vote and led to the election of democrat woodrow wilson although several candidates were openly competing for the 1916 nomination—most prominently conservative senator elihu root of new york senator john w weeks of massachusetts and liberal senator albert cummins of iowa—the partys bosses wanted a moderate who would be acceptable to all factions of the party they turned to supreme court justice charles evans hughes who had served on the court since 1910 and thus had the advantage of not having publicly spoken about political issues in six years although he had not sought the nomination hughes made it known that he would not turn it down he won the nomination on the third ballot former vicepresident charles w fairbanks was nominated as his running mate hughes was the only supreme court justice to be nominated for president by a major political party fairbanks as of 2016 was the last former vice president to be nominated for vice president thensenator warren g harding is credited with coining

party though the nomination of a dark horse candidate such as massachusetts senator henry cabot lodge or general leonard wood seemed possible2 many republicans sought to nominate a candidate palatable to theodore roosevelt in hopes of averting another thirdparty run by progressive republicans though these republicans were unwilling to nominate roosevelt himself2 roosevelts influence put a stop to the potential presidential candidacies of former ohio congressman theodore e burton and ohio senator warren g harding2 former vice president charles fairbanks made a run at the presidency and attempted to curry roosevelts support but roosevelt refused to support fairbanks3 hughes won the nomination on the third ballot and roosevelt chose to forgo a thirdparty bid associate justice charles
