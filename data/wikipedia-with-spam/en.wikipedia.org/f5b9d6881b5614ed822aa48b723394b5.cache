branch of information engineering it involves the practice of information processing and the engineering of information systems and as an academic field it is an applied form of information science the field considers the interaction between humans and information alongside the construction of interfaces organisations technologies and systems as such the field of informatics has great breadth and encompasses many subspecialties including disciplines of computer science information systems information technology and statistics since the advent of computers individuals and organizations increasingly process information digitally this has led to the study of informatics with computational mathematical biological cognitive and social aspects including study of the social impact of information technologies contents 1 etymology 2 history 3 academic schools and departments 4 applied disciplines 41 organizational informatics 5 see also 6 notes 7 external links etymologyedit see also computer science § etymology in 1956 the german computer scientist karl steinbuch coined the word informatik by publishing a paper called informatik automatische informationsverarbeitung informatics automatic information processing1 the english term informatics is sometimes understood as meaning the same as computer science the german word informatik is usually translated to english as computer science the french term informatique was coined in 1962 by philippe dreyfus2 together with various translations—informatics english also proposed independently and simultaneously by walter f bauer and associates who cofounded informatics inc and informatica italian spanish romanian portuguese dutch referring to the application of computers to store and process information the term was coined as a combination of information and automatic to describe the science of automating information interactions the morphology—information ics—uses the accepted form for names of sciences as conics linguistics optics or matters of practice as economics politics tactics3 and so linguistically the meaning extends easily to encompass both the science of information and the practice of information processing historyedit see also history of computer science and history of computing the culture of library science promotes policies and procedures for managing information that fosters the relationship between library science and the development of information science to provide benefits for health informatics development which is traced to the 1950s with the beginning of computer uses in healthcare nelson staggers p4 early practitioners interested in the field soon learned that there were no formal education programs set up to educate them on the informatics science until the late 1960s and early 1970s professional development began to emerge playing a significant role in the development of health informatics nelson staggers p7 according to imhoff et al 2001 healthcare informatics is not only the application of computer technology to problems in healthcare but covers all aspects of generation handling communication storage retrieval management analysis discovery and synthesis of data information and knowledge in the entire scope of healthcare furthermore they stated that the primary goal of health informatics can be distinguished as follows to provide solutions for problems related to data information and knowledge processing to study general principles of processing data information and knowledge in medicine and healthcare reference imhoff m webb agoldschmidt a 2001 health informatics intensive care med 27 179186 doi101007s001340000747 nelson r staggers n health informatics an interprofessional approach st louis mosby 2013 print p47 this new term was adopted across western europe and except in english developed a meaning roughly translated by the english ‘computer science’ or ‘computing science’ mikhailov advocated the russian term informatika 1966 and the english informatics 1967 as names for the theory of scientific information and argued for a broader meaning including study of the use of information technology in various communities for example scientific and of the interaction of technology and human organizational structures informatics is the discipline of science which investigates the structure and properties not specific content of scientific information as well as the regularities of scientific information activity its theory history methodology and organization4 usage has since modified this definition in three ways first the restriction to scientific information is removed as in business informatics or legal informatics second since most information is now digitally stored computation is now central to informatics third the representation processing and communication of information are added as objects of investigation since they have been recognized as fundamental to any scientific account of information taking information as the central focus of study distinguishes informatics from computer science informatics includes the study of biological and social mechanisms of information processing whereas computer science focuses on the digital computation similarly in the study of representation and communication informatics is indifferent to the substrate that carries information for example it encompasses the study of communication using gesture speech and language as well as digital communications and networking in the englishspeaking world the term informatics was first widely used in the compound medical informatics taken to include the cognitive information processing and communication tasks of medical practice education and research including information science and the technology to support these tasks5 many such compounds are now in use they can be viewed as different areas of applied informatics indeed in the us however informatics is linked with applied computing or computing in the context of another domain6 informatics encompasses the study of systems that represent process and communicate information however the theory of computation in the specific discipline of theoretical computer science which evolved from alan turing studies the notion of a complex system regardless of whether or not information actually exists since both fields process information there is some disagreement among scientists as to field hierarchy for example arizona state university attempted to adopt a broader definition of informatics to even encompass cognitive science at the launch of its school of computing and informatics in september 2006 a broad interpretation of informatics as the study of the structure algorithms behaviour and interactions of natural and artificial computational systems was introduced by the university of edinburgh in 1994 when it formed the grouping that is now its school of informatics this meaning is now 2006 increasingly used in the united kingdom7 the 2008 research assessment exercise of the uk funding councils includes a new computer science and informatics unit of assessment uoa8 whose scope is described as follows the uoa includes the study of methods for acquiring storing processing communicating and reasoning about information and the role of interactivity in natural and artificial systems through the implementation organisation and use of computer hardware software and other resources the subjects are characterised by the rigorous application of analysis experimentation and design academic schools and departmentsedit academic research in the informatics area can be found in a number of disciplines such as computer science information technology information and computer science information system business information management and health informatics in france the first degree level qualifications in informatics computer science appeared in the mid1960scitation needed in englishspeaking countries the first example of a degree level qualification in informatics occurred in 1982 when plymouth polytechnic now the university of plymouth offered a fouryear bschonours degree in computing and informatics – with an initial intake of only 35 students the course still runs today 9 making it the longest available qualification in the subject at the indiana university school of informatics bloomington indianapolis and southeast informatics is defined as the art science and human dimensions of information technology and the study application and social consequences of technology it is also defined in informatics 101 introduction to informatics as the application of information technology to the arts sciences and professions these definitions are widely accepted in the united states and differ from british usage in omitting the study of natural computation texas womans university places its informatics degrees in its department of mathematics and computer science within the college of arts sciences though it offers interdisciplinary health informatics degrees10 informatics is presented in a generalist framework as evidenced by their definition of informatics using technology and data analytics to derive meaningful information from data for data and decision driven practice in user centered systems though twu is also known for its nursing and health informatics programs at the university of california irvine department of informatics informatics is defined as the interdisciplinary study of the design application use and impact of information technology the discipline of informatics is based on the recognition that the design of this technology is not solely a technical matter but must focus on the relationship between the technology and its use in realworld settings that is informatics designs solutions in context and takes into account the social cultural and organizational settings in which computing and information technology will be used at the university of michigan ann arbor informatics interdisciplinary major informatics is defined as the study of information and the ways information is used by and affects human beings and social systems the major involves coursework from the college of literature science and the arts where the informatics major is housed as well as the school of information and the college of engineering key to this growing field is that it applies both technological and social perspectives to the study of information michigans interdisciplinary approach to teaching informatics gives a solid grounding in contemporary computer programming mathematics and statistics combined with study of the ethical and social science aspects of complex information systems experts in the field help design new information technology tools for specific scientific business and cultural needs michigan offers four curricular tracks within the informatics degree to provide students with increased expertise these four track topics include11 internet informatics an applied track in which students experiment with technologies behind internetbased information systems and acquire skills to map problems to deployable internetbased solutions this track will replace computational informatics in fall 201312 data mining information analysis integrates the collection analysis and visualization of complex data and its critical role in research business and government to provide students with practical skills and a theoretical basis for approaching challenging data analysis problems life science informatics examines artificial information systems which has helped scientists make great progress in identifying core components of organisms and ecosystems social computing advances in computing have created opportunities for studying patterns of social interaction and developing systems that act as introducers recommenders coordinators and recordkeepers students in this track craft evaluate and refine social software computer applications for engaging technology in unique social contexts this track will be phased out in fall 2013 in favor of the new bachelor of science in information this will be the first undergraduate degree offered by the school of information since its founding in 1996 the school of information already contains a masters program doctorate program and a professional masters program in conjunction with the school of public health the bs in information at the university of michigan will be the first curriculum program of its kind in the united states with the first graduating class to emerge in 2015 students will be able to apply for this unique degree in 2013 for the 2014 fall semester the new degree will be a stem off of the most popular social computing track in the current informatics interdisciplinary major in lsa applications will be open to upperclassmen juniors and seniors along with a variety of information classes available for first and second year students to gauge interest and value in the specific sector of study the degree was approved by the university on june 11 201213 along with a new degree in the school of information there has also been the first and only chapter of an informatics professional fraternity kappa theta pi chartered in fall 201214 at the university of washington seattle informatics undergraduate program informatics is an undergraduate program offered by the information school bachelor of science in informatics is described as a program that focuses on computer systems from a usercentered perspective and studies the structure behavior and interactions of natural and artificial systems that store process and communicate information includes instruction in
