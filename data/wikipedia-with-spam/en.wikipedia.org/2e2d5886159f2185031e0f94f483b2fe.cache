microsoft research asia4 microsoft sued google and kaifu lee for the move but reached a confidential settlement5 googles beijing office was initially located at nci tower in 2005 a chineselanguage interface was developed for the googlecom website in january 2006 google launched its chinabased googlecn search page with results subject to censorship by the chinese government67 the beijing office

blocked access to googles youtube site due to footage showing chinese security forces beating tibetans8 access to other google online services is denied to users arbitrarily on september 4 2009 after four years leading google china kaifu lee unexpectedly left to start a venture fund amid debate about the chinese governments censorship policies and googles decreasing share to rival baidu and sosocom4 ending of selfcensorshipedit in january 2010 google announced that in response to a chineseoriginated hacking attack on them and other us tech companies they were no longer willing to censor searches in china and would pull out of the country completely if necessary9 at the same time google started to redirect all search queries from googlecn to googlecomhk in hong kong which returned results without censorship101112 hong kong is vested with independent judicial power13 and not subject to most chinese laws14 including those requiring the restriction of free flow of information and censorship of internet traffic david drummond senior vice president of google stated in the official google blog that the circumstances surrounding censorship of the internet in china led google to move its search to hong kong the absence of censorship making it more effective for networking and sharing information with internet users in mainland china12 on march 30 2010 searching via all google search sites in all languages was banned in mainland china any attempt to search using google resulted in a dns error initial reports suggested that the error was caused by a banned string rfa as in radio free asia being automatically added to google search queries upstream of user queries with prominent china journalists disagreeing over whether the blockage was an intentional and highlevel attempt to censor search results other google services such as google mail and google maps appeared to be unaffected15 xiao qiang director of the china internet project at uc berkeley and founder of the china digital times noted that the ban in mainland china could eventually block all access to google sites and applications if the chinese government wanted15 the ban was lifted the next day16 on june 30 2010 google ended the automatic redirect of google china to google hong kong and instead placed a link to google hong kong to avoid their internet content provider icp license being revoked17 the fact that google had ended some of its services in china and the reasons for it were censored in china18 in 2013 google stopped displaying warning messages that had shown up for mainland chinese users who were attempting to search for politically sensitive phrases19 googles internet mail service gmail and chrome and googlebased search inquiries have not been available to mainland china users since 2014 google has maintained that it would continue with the research and development offices in china along with the sales offices for other google products such as android smartphone software20 businessedit google china headquarters in tsinghua university science park in beijing google china serves a market of mainland chinese internet users that was estimated in july 2009 to number 338 million21 up from 458 million in june 200222 a china internet network information center cnnic report published a year and a half earlier on january 17 2001 had estimated the mainland chinese internet user base at 225 million considerably higher than the number published by iamasia a private internet ratings company23 the first cnnic report published on october 10 1997 estimated the number of chinese internet users at fewer than 650 thousand people the competitors of google china include sogou and baidu often called the google of china because of its resemblance and similarity to google2425 in august 2008 google china launched a legal music download service google music to rival baidus potentially illicit offering26 google china local product—google musics conference in 2010 google china had a market share in china of 29 according to analysys international27 by october 2012 that number was down to 528 it further declined to 17 in 2013 controversiesedit see also censorship by google before google chinas establishment googlecom itself was accessible even though much of its content was not accessible because of censorship according to official statistics googlecom was accessible 90 of the time and a number of services were not available at all29 since announcing its intent to comply with internet censorship laws in china google china had been the focus of controversy over what critics view as capitulation to the golden shield project because of its selfimposed censorship whenever people searched for prohibited chinese keywords on a blocked list maintained by the prc government googlecn displayed at the bottom of the page translated in accordance with local laws regulations and policies part of the search result is not shown some searches such as as of june 2009 tank man were blocked entirely with only the message search results may not comply with the relevant laws regulations and policy and cannot be displayed appearing google argued that it could play a role more useful to the cause of free speech by participating in chinas it industry than by refusing to comply and being denied admission to the mainland chinese market while removing search results is inconsistent with googles mission providing no information or a heavily degraded user experience that amounts to no information is more inconsistent with our mission a statement said30 a us pbs analysis reported clear differences between results returned for controversial keywords by the censored and uncensored search engines31 google set up computer systems inside china that try to access web sites outside the country if a site is inaccessible eg because of the golden shield project then it was added to google chinas blacklist32 in june 2006 google cofounder sergey brin was quoted as saying that virtually all of googles customers in china were using the noncensored version of their website33 google critics in the united states claimed that google china is a flagrant violation of the google motto dont be evil34 on april 9 2007 google china spokesman cui jin admitted that the pinyin google input method editor ime was built leveraging some nongoogle database resources this was in response to a request on april 6 from the chinese search engine company sohu that google stop distributing its pinyin ime software because it allegedly copied portions from sohus own software35 in early 2008 guo quan a university professor who had been dismissed after having founded a democratic opposition party announced plans to sue yahoo and google in the united states for having blocked his name from search results in mainland china36 operation auroraedit main article operation aurora on january 12 2010 google announced that it was no longer willing to continue censoring results on googlecn citing a breach of gmail accounts of chinese human rights activists including thousands of activists involved with the human rights defender falun gong and hundreds of overseas activists in fields such as encryption intellectual property and democracy the company learned that the hackers had breached two gmail accounts but were only able to access from and to information and subject headers of emails in these accounts37 the companys investigation into the attack showed that at least 34 other companies had been similarly targeted including adobe systems symantec yahoo northrop grumman and dow chemical experts claim the aim of the attacks was to gain information on weapon systems political dissidents and valuable source code that powers software applications38 additionally dozens of gmail accounts in china europe and the united states had been regularly accessed by third parties by way of phishing or malware on the users computers rather than a security breach at google although google did not explicitly accuse the chinese government of the breach it said it was no longer willing to censor results on googlecn and that it would discuss over the next few weeks the basis on which we could run an unfiltered search engine within the law if at all we recognize that this may well mean having to shut down googlecn and potentially our offices in china3940 googlecn transiently turned off its search result filtering however the filtering was later reenabled without any acknowledgment or explanation search queries in chinese on the keywords tiananmen or june 4 1989 returned censored results with the standard censorship footnote41 on january 13 2010 the news agency ahn reported that the us congress planned to investigate googles allegations that the chinese government used the companys service to spy on human rights activists42 in a major speech by the us secretary of state hillary clinton analogies were drawn between the berlin wall and the free and unfree internet43 chinese articles came back saying that the united states uses the internet as a means to create worldwide hegemony based on western values44 the issue of googles changed policy toward china has been cited as a potentially major development in world affairs marking a split between authoritarian socialism and the western model of free capitalism and internet access45 the chinese government since made numerous standard and general statements on the matter but took no real action it also criticized google for failing to provide any evidence of its accusation46 accusations were made by baidu a competing chinese search engine that google was pulling out for financial rather than other reasons baidu is the market leader in china with about 60 of the market compared to googles 31 yahoo placing third with less than 1047 the chinese peoples daily newspaper published a scathing oped on google which criticized western leaders for politicizing the way in which china controls citizens access to the internet saying implementing monitoring according to a countrys national context is what any government has to do and that chinas need to censor the internet is greater than that of developed countries the chinese society has generally less information bearing capacity than developed countries such as the us 48 in mediaedit according to joseph cheng a professor of political science from city university of hong kong the ruling chinese communist party was deploying chinese nationalism to stifle debate about censorship49 by criticizing cultural export in this case the localization of google in china it provides defense to justify the chinese authorities censorship control49 the chinese authorities are accused of steering staterun media to bundle google together with other recent disputes with united states that have stirred nationalist rancour in china on the website of the global times wwwhuanqiucom such examples are found one user wrote get the hell out while another one wrote ha ha im going to buy firecrackers to celebrate49 isaac mao a prominent chinese internet expert speculated that 90 of internet users in china do not care whether google leaves or not among chinese users who strongly support google remaining in china without censorship or leaving china to keep its neutrality and independence many are accustomed to using circumvention technology to access blocked websites50 censorshipedit see also censorship by google the chinese government is widely known for their long tight control over internet access in mainland china regulating what its citizens can read see and publish on the web51 the chinese authorities employed more than 2 million people in 2013 to monitor web activity on blogs and social media sites like the widely popular social media site weibo and to block access to topics they deem to be sensitive52 subsequent eventsedit see also 2014 china censorship of google services since may 27 2014 googles various services have been suspected of having been subject to malicious interference from the great firewall of china as a result of which users became unable to access them since then users from mainland china found that googles various subsites and other services google play gmail google docs etc could not be accessed or used normally including login to google account although some services like google map and google translate remained functional users from certain places still failed to visit them on the evening of july 10 2014 users became able use googles services and functions but users reported that access was denied the next day blockage of googleedit in november 2012 greatfireorg reported that china had blocked access to google the group reported that all google domains including google search gmail and google maps became inaccessible the reason for the blockage was likely to control the content in the nations internet while the government prepared to change leadership53 as the 25th anniversary of the tiananmen square massacre approached chinese authorities blocked more websites and search engines greatfire said that the block was farreaching and that google simply wasnt working the block is indiscriminate as all google services in all countries encrypted or not are now blocked in china this blockage includes google search images gmail and almost all other products in addition the block covers google hong kong googlecom and all other country specific versions eg google france it is the tightest censorship ever deployed the company began to redirect search results from mainland china to its hong kong website which led the chinese authorities to block the hong kong site by making users wait 90 seconds for banned results the chinese government not only blocked google but other websites such as wikipedia the wall street journal youtubecom linkedin and facebook are also accessiblewhencitation needed albeit at slower speeds and less reliable connectivity keyword censorshipedit google added a new software feature to warn users when they type in a word censored or blocked in china google began to offer suggestions about possible sensitive or banned keywords in china54 china maintains tight control over the internet nipping in the bud any signs of dissent or challenges to the ruling communist partys leadership55 for example searching the chinese character jiang — which means river but is also a common surname — was blocked after erroneous rumors about the death of jiang zemin former general secretary of the communist party of china56 google vs chinaedit google has had a rocky relationship with the chinese authorities since january 2010 when the company said it might shut down chinese operations due to a sophisticated and targeted cyber attack google said at the time that it was no longer willing to censor its chinese search engine the forced blockage of googles service and googles subsequent threat to pull out highlight concerns of cyberspace security within china while jiang yu a spokesperson of the chinas foreign ministry promoted the chinese governments development of the internet wang chen of chinas state council information office defended online censorship maintaining the safe operation of the internet and the secure flow of information is a fundamental requirement for guaranteeing state security and peoples fundamental interests promoting economic development and cultural prosperity and maintaining a harmonious and stable society57 in 2014 in response to a series of terrorist attacks china made all google services almost unusable by tightening its internet censorship often called the great firewall of china in 2009 onethird of all searches in china were on google as of 2013 the us company has only 17 market share2 see alsoedit google bomb censorship by google illegal flower tribute internet censorship in china chinese intelligence operations in the united states
