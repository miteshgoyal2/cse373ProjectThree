leet from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for other uses see leet disambiguation a 31337 h4x0r laptop sticker along with a kevin mitnick sticker leet or 1337 also known as eleet or leetspeak is an alternative alphabet for many languages that is used primarily on the internet it uses some characters to replace others in ways that play on the similarity of their glyphs via reflection or other resemblance for example leet spellings of the word leet include 1337 and l33t eleet may be spelled 31337 or 3l33t the term leet is derived from the word elite the leet alphabet is a specialized form of symbolic writing leet may also be considered a substitution cipher although many dialects or linguistic varieties exist in different online communities the term leet is also used as an adjective to describe formidable prowess or accomplishment especially in the fields of online gaming and in its original usage—computer hacking contents 1 history 2 orthography 3 morphology 4 grammar 5 vocabulary 51 terminology and common misspellings 52 haxor and suxxor suxorz 53 n00b 54 owned and pwned 55 pr0n 6 see also 7 notes 8 footnotes 9 references 10 external links history leet originated within bulletin board systems bbs in the 1980s12 where having elite status on a bbs allowed a user access to file folders games and special chat rooms the cult of the dead cow hacker collective has been credited with the original coining of the term in their textfiles of that era3 one theory is that it was developed to defeat text filters created by bbs or internet relay chat system operators for message boards to discourage the discussion of forbidden topics like cracking and hacking1 creative misspellings and asciiartderived words were also a way to attempt to indicate one was knowledgeable about the culture of computer users once the reserve of hackers crackers and script kiddies leet has since entered the mainstream1 it is now also used to mock newbies or newcomers on web sites or in gaming communities4 some consider emoticons and ascii art like smiley faces to be leet while others maintain that leet consists of only symbolic word encryption more obscure forms of leet involving the use of symbol combinations and almost no letters or numbers continue to be used for its original purpose of encrypted communication it is also sometimes used as a script language variants of leet have been used for censorship purposes for many years for instance ass and shit are frequently seen to make a word appear censored to the untrained eye but obvious to a person familiar with leet leet symbols especially the number 1337 are internet memes that have spilled over into popular culture signs that show the numbers 1337 are popular motifs for pictures and shared widely across the internet orthography one of the hallmarks of leet is its unique approach to orthography using substitutions of other characters letters or otherwise to represent a letter or letters in a word56 for more casual use of leet the primary strategy is to use homoglyphs symbols that closely resemble to varying degrees the letters for which they stand the choice of symbol is not fixed—anything that the reader can make sense of is valid however this practice is not extensively used in regular leet more often it is seen in situations where the argot ie secret language characteristics of the system are required either to exclude newbies or outsiders in general ie anything that the average reader cannot make sense of is valid a valid reader should himself try to make sense if deserving of the underlying message another use for leet orthographic substitutions is the creation of paraphrased passwords1 limitations imposed by websites on password length usually no more than 36 and the characters permitted usually alphanumeric and underscorecitation needed require less extensive forms of leet when used in this application some examples of leet include b1ff and n00b a term for the stereotypical newbie the l33t programming language and the webcomic megatokyo which contains characters who speak leet morphology text rendered in leet is often characterized by distinctive recurring forms the xor suffix the meaning of this suffix is parallel with the english er and r suffixes seen in hacker and lesser2 in that it derives agent nouns from a verb stem it is realized in two different forms xor and zor sɔːr and zɔːr respectively for example the first may be seen in the word haxxor h4x0r in leet ˈhæksɔːr and the second in pwnzor ˈoʊnzɔːr additionally this nominalization may also be inflected with all of the suffixes of regular english verbs the letter o is often replaced with the numeral 0 the age suffix derivation of a noun from a verb stem is possible by attaching age to the base form of any verb attested derivations are pwnage skillage and speakage however leet provides exceptions the word leetage is acceptable referring to actively being leet7 these nouns are often used with a form of to be rather than to have eg that was pwnage rather than he has pwnage either is a more emphatic way of expressing the simpler he pwns but the former implies that the person is embodying the trait rather than merely possessing it the ness suffix derivation of a noun from an adjective stem is done by attaching ness to any adjective this is entirely the same as the english form except it is used much more often in leet nouns such as lulzness and leetness are derivations using this suffix words ending in ed when forming a past participle ending in ed the leet user may replace the e with an apostrophe as was common in poetry of previous centuries eg pwned becomes pwnd sometimes the apostrophe is removed as well eg pwned becomes pwnd the word ending may also be substituted by t eg pwned becomes pwnt8 use of the suffix words ending in and anned ant or a similar sound can sometimes be spelled with an ampersand to express the ending sound eg this is the sbox im sorry youve been b hillfarm this is most commonly used with the word banned an alternate form of b is b7 as the ampersand is typed with the 7 key in the standard us keyboard layout it is often seen in the phrase ibb7 in before banned which indicates that the poster believes that a previous poster will soon be banned from the site channel or board on which they are both posting grammar leet can be pronounced as a single syllable ˈliːt rhyming with eat by way of aphesis of the initial vowel of elite it may also be pronounced as two syllables ɛˈliːt like hacker slang leet enjoys a looser grammar than standard english4 the loose grammar just like loose spelling encodes some level of emphasis ironic or otherwise a reader must rely more on intuitive parsing of leet to determine the meaning of a sentence rather than the actual sentence structure in particular speakers of leet are fond of verbing nouns turning verbs into nouns and back again as forms of emphasis eg austin rocks is weaker than austin roxxorz note spelling which is weaker than au5t1n is t3h r0xx0rz note grammar which is weaker than something like 0mfg d00d ü571n 15 t3h ll83я 1337 я0xx0яz omg dude austin is the überelite rockser in essence all of these mean austin rocks not necessarily the other options added words and misspellings add to the speakers enjoyment leet like hacker slang employs analogy in construction of new words for example if haxored is the past tense of the verb to hack hack → haxor → haxored then winzored would be easily understood to be the past tense conjugation of to win even if the reader had not seen that particular word before leet has its own colloquialisms many of which originated as jokes based on common typing errors habits of new computer users or knowledge of cyberculture and history9 leet is not solely based upon one language or character set greek russian and other languages have leet forms and leet in one language may use characters from another where they are available as such while it may be referred to as a cipher a dialect or a language leet does not fit squarely into any of these categories the term leet itself is often written 31337 or 1337 and many other variations after the meaning of these became widely familiar 10100111001 came to be used in its place because it is the binary form of 1337 decimal making it more of a puzzle to interpretnotes 1 an increasingly common characteristic of leet is the changing of grammatical usage so as to be deliberately incorrect the widespread popularity of deliberate misspelling is similar to the cult following of the all your base are belong to us phrase indeed the online and computer communities have been international from their inception so spellings and phrases typical of nonnative speakers are quite common vocabulary many words originally derived from leet slang have now become part of the modern internet slang such as pwned1 the original driving forces of new vocabulary in leet were common misspellings and typing errors such as teh generally considered lolspeak and intentional misspellings10 especially the z at the end of words skillz1 another prominent example of a surviving leet expression is w00t an exclamation of joy2 w00t is sometimes used as a backronym for we owned the other team new words or corruptions thereof may arise from a need to make ones username unique as any given internet service reaches more people the number of names available to a given user is drastically reduced while many users may wish to have the username catlover for example in many cases it is only possible for one user to have the moniker as such degradations of the name may evolve such as c7l0vr as the leet cipher is highly dynamic there is a wider possibility for multiple users to share the same name through combinations of spelling and transliterations additionally leet—the word itself—can be found in the screennames and gamertags of many internet and video games use of the term in such a manner announces a high level of skill though such an announcement may be seen as baseless hubris11 terminology and common misspellings warez nominally ˈwɛərz is a plural shortening of software typically referring to cracked and redistributed software11 phreaking refers to the hacking of telephone systems and other noninternet equipment1 teh originated as a typographical error of the and is sometimes spelled t3h112 j00 takes the place of you2 originating from the affricate sound that occurs in place of the palatal approximant j when you follows a word ending in an alveolar plosive consonant such as t or d also from german is über which means over or above it usually appears as a prefix attached to adjectives and is frequently written without the umlaut over the u13 haxor and suxxor suxorz haxor and derivations thereof is leet for hacker14 and it is one of the most commonplace examples of the use of the xor suffix suxxor pronounced suckzor is a derogatory term which originated in warez culture and is currently used in multiuser environments such as multiplayer video games and instant messaging it like haxor is one of the early leet words to use the xor suffix suxxor is a modified version of sucks the phrase to suck and the meaning is the same as the english slang its negative definition essentially makes it the opposite of roxxor and both can be used as a verb or a noun the letters ck are often replaced with the greek χ chi in other words as well n00b main article newbie within leet the term n00b and derivations thereof is used extensively the word means and derives from newbie as in new and inexperienced or uninformed101315 and is used as a means of segregating them as less than the elite or even normal members of a group owned and pwned main articles owned and pwn owned and pwn3d generally pronounced owned and poned respectively both refer to the domination of a player in a video game or argument rather than just a win or the successful hacking of a website or computer11316 as is a common characteristic of leet the terms have also been adapted into noun and adjective forms13 ownage and pwnage which can refer to the situation of pwning or to the superiority of its subject eg he is a very good player he is pwnage pr0n pr0n is slang for pornography1 this is a deliberately inaccurate spellingpronunciation for porn15 where a zero is often used to replace the letter o it is sometimes used in legitimate communications such as email discussion groups usenet chat rooms and internet web pages to circumvent language and content filters which may reject messages as offensive or spam the word also helps prevent search engines from associating commercial sites with pornography which might result in unwelcome trafficcitation needed pr0n is also sometimes spelled backwards n0rp to further obscure the meaning to potentially uninformed readersnotes 2 it can also refer to ascii art depicting pornographic images or to photos of the internals of consumer and industrial hardware prawn a spoof of the misspelling has started to come into use as well in grand theft auto vice city a pornographer films his movies on prawn island conversely in the rpg kingdom of loathing prawn referring to a kind of crustacean is spelled pr0n leading to the creation of food items such as pr0n chow mein see also
