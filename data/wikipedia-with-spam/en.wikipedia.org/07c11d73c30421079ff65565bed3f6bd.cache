santa claus frequently depicts him listening to the christmas wishes of different children santa claus also known as saint nicholas saint nick kris kringle father christmas or simply santa santy in hibernoenglish is a legendary figure of western christian culture who is said to bring gifts to the homes of wellbehaved good or nice children on christmas eve 24 december and the early morning hours of christmas day 25 december1 the modern santa claus grew out of traditions surrounding the historical saint nicholas a fourthcentury greek bishop and giftgiver of myra the british figure of father christmas and the dutch figure of sinterklaas himself also based on saint nicholas some maintain santa claus also absorbed elements of the germanic god wodan who was associated with the pagan midwinter event of yule and led the wild hunt a ghostly procession through the sky santa claus is generally depicted as a portly joyous whitebearded man—sometimes with spectacles—wearing a red coat with white fur collar and cuffs whitefurcuffed red trousers and black leather belt and boots and who carries a bag full of gifts for children this image became popular in the united states and canada in the 19th century due to the significant influence of the 1823 poem a visit from st nicholas and of caricaturist and political cartoonist thomas nast234 this image has been maintained and reinforced through song radio television childrens books films and advertising santa claus is said to make lists of children throughout the world categorizing them according to their behavior good and bad or naughty and nice and to deliver presents including toys and candy to all of the wellbehaved children in the world and coal to all the misbehaved children on the single night of christmas eve he

from saint catherines monastery sinai main article saint nicholas saint nicholas of myra was a 4thcentury greek christian bishop of myra now demre in lycia a province of the byzantine empire now in turkey nicholas was famous for his generous gifts to the poor in particular presenting the three impoverished daughters of a pious christian with dowries so that they would not have to become prostitutes7 he was very religious from an early age and devoted his life entirely to christianity in continental europe more precisely the netherlands belgium austria and germany he is usually portrayed as a bearded bishop in canonical robes the remains of saint nicholas are in italy in 1087 the italian city of bari mounted an expedition to locate the tomb of the saint the reliquary of st nicholas was conquered by italian sailors and his relics were taken to bari89 where they are kept to this day a basilica was constructed the same year to store the loot and the area became a pilgrimage site for the devout sailors from bari collected just half of nicholas skeleton leaving all the minor fragments in the grave these were collected by venetian sailors during the first crusade and taken to venice where a church to st nicholas the patron of sailors was built on the san nicolò al lido this tradition was confirmed in two important scientific investigations of the relics in bari and venice which revealed that the relics in the two italian cities belong to the same skeleton saint nicholas was later claimed as a patron saint of many diverse groups from archers sailors and children to pawnbrokers710 he is also the patron saint of both amsterdam and moscow11 during the middle ages often on the evening before his name day of 6 december children were bestowed gifts in his honour this date was earlier than the original day of gifts for the children which moved in the course of the reformation and its opposition to the veneration of saints in many countries on the 24 and 25 december so saint nicholas changed to santa claus the custom of gifting to children at christmas has been propagated by martin luther as an alternative to the previous very popular gift custom on st nicholas to focus the interest of the children to christ instead of the veneration of saints martin luther first suggested the christkind as the bringer of gifts but nicholas remained popular as gifts bearer for the people121314 father christmas ghost of christmas present an illustration by john leech made for charles dickenss festive classic a christmas carol 1843 main article father

belgium sinterklaas day presents are offered exclusively to children whereas on christmas day all ages may receive presents sinterklaas assistants are called zwarte pieten in dutch pères fouettard in french so they are not elves19 germanic paganism wodan and christianization an 1886 depiction of the longbearded norse god odin by georg von rosen prior to christianization the germanic peoples including the english celebrated a midwinter event called yule old english geola or giuli20 with the christianization of germanic europe numerous traditions were absorbed from yuletide celebrations into modern christmas21 during this period supernatural and ghostly occurrences were said to increase in frequency such as the wild hunt a ghostly procession through the skycitation needed the leader of the wild hunt is frequently attested as the god wodan norse odin bearing among many names the names jólnir meaning yule figure and langbarðr meaning longbeard in old norse22 wodans role during the yuletide period has been theorized as having influenced concepts of st nicholas in a variety of facets including his long white beard and his gray horse for nightly rides compare odins horse sleipnir or his reindeer in north american tradition23 folklorist margaret baker maintains that the appearance of santa claus or father christmas whose day is 25th of december owes much to odin the old bluehooded cloaked whitebearded giftbringer of the north who rode the midwinter sky on his eightfooted steed sleipnir visiting his people with gifts … odin transformed into father christmas then santa claus prospered with st nicholas and the christchild became a leading player on the christmas stage24 in finland they still use joulupukki or the christmas goat history origins premodern representations of the giftgiver from church history and folklore notably st nicholas known in dutch as sinterklaas merged with the english character father christmas to create the character known to americans and the rest of the englishspeaking world as santa claus a phonetic derivation of sinterklaas in the english and later british colonies of north america and later in the united states british and dutch versions of the giftgiver merged further for example in washington irvings history of new york 1809 sinterklaas was americanized into santa claus a name first used in the american press in 177325 but lost his bishops apparel and was at first pictured as a thickbellied dutch sailor with a pipe in a green winter coat irvings book was a lampoon of the dutch culture of new york and much of this portrait is his joking invention 19th century illustration to verse 1 of old santeclaus with much delight 1850 illustration of saint nicolas with his servant père fouettard zwarte piet

stockings is an occasion now of sadness and gloom i have nothing even to put in 8yearold daughter sadais stocking which hangs so invitingly for santa claus how disappointed she will be in the morning though i have explained to her why he cannot come poor children why must the innocent suffer with the guilty diary of dolly lunt burge a maine native widow of thomas burge and resident living c 40 miles southeast of atlanta near covington georgia this entry from mrs burges diary was five weeks after most of general t shermans us army forces had passed on their blackenedearth march across georgia toward savanna after the armys destruction of atlanta in midnovember 1864 us army mopup companies and stragglers during those intervening weeks continued to forage loot burn and liberate slaves hence the concern of mrs burge and her household26 in 1821 the book a newyears present to the little ones from five to twelve was published in new york it contained old santeclaus with much delight an anonymous poem describing santeclaus on a reindeer sleigh bringing presents to children27 some modern ideas of santa claus seemingly became canon after the anonymous publication of the poem a visit from st nicholas better known today as the night before christmas in the troy new york sentinel on 23 december 1823 clement clarke moore later claimed authorship though some scholars contest persuasively that henry livingston jr who died nine years before moores claim was the author728 st nick is described as being chubby and plump a right jolly old elf with a little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly in spite of which the miniature sleigh and tiny reindeer still indicate that he is physically diminutive the reindeer were also named dasher dancer prancer vixen comet cupid dunder and blixem dunder and blixem came from the old dutch words for thunder and lightning which were later changed to the more german sounding donner and blitzen29 by 1845 kris kringle was a common variant of santa in parts of the us30 a magazine article from 1853 describing american christmas customs to british readers refers to children hanging up their stockings on christmas eve for a fabulous personage whose name varies in pennsylvania he is usually called krishkinkle but in new york he is st nicholas or santa claus the author31 quotes moores poem in its entirety saying that its descriptions apply to krishkinkle too32 as the years passed santa claus evolved in popular culture into a large heavyset person one of the first artists to define santa clauss modern image was thomas nast an american cartoonist of the 19th century in 1863 a picture of santa illustrated by nast appeared in harpers weekly thomas nast immortalized santa claus with an illustration for the 3 january 1863 issue of harpers weekly santa was dressed in an american flag and had a puppet with the name jeff written on it reflecting its civil war context the story that santa claus lives at the north pole may also have been a nast creation his christmas image in the harpers issue dated 29 december 1866 was a collage of engravings titled santa claus and his works which included the caption santa claussville np33 a color collection of nasts pictures published in 1869 had a poem also titled santa claus and his works by george p webster who wrote that santa clauss home was near the north pole in the ice and snow34 the tale had become well known by the 1870s a boy from colorado writing to the childrens magazine the nursery in late 1874 said if we did not live so very far from the north pole i should ask santa claus to bring me a donkey35 the idea of a wife for santa claus may have been the creation of american authors beginning in the mid19th century in 1889 the poet katharine lee bates popularized mrs claus in the poem goody santa claus on a sleigh ride is there a santa claus was the title of an editorial appearing in the 21 september 1897 edition of the new york sun the editorial which included the famous reply yes virginia there is a santa claus has become an indelible part of popular christmas lore in the united states and canada

the world exposes him to the misery and poverty of children in the outside world santa strives to find a way to bring joy into the lives of all children and eventually invents toys as a principal means santa later appears in the road to oz as a honored guest at ozmas birthday party stated to be famous and beloved enough for everyone to bow even before he is announced as the most mighty and loyal friend of children his supreme highness santa claus images of santa claus were further popularized through haddon sundbloms depiction of him for the cocacola companys christmas advertising in the 1930s736 the popularity of the image spawned urban legends that santa claus was invented by the cocacola company or that santa wears red and white because they are the colors used to promote the cocacola brand37 historically cocacola was not the first soft drink company to utilize the modern image of santa claus in its advertising—white rock beverages had already used a red and white santa to sell mineral water in 1915 and then in advertisements for its ginger ale in 1923383940 earlier still santa claus had appeared dressed in red and white and essentially in his current form on several covers of puck magazine in the first few years of the 20th century41 a man dressed as santa claus fundraising for volunteers of america on the sidewalk of street in chicago illinois in 1902 he is wearing a mask with a beard attached the image of santa claus as a benevolent character became reinforced with its association with charity and philanthropy particularly by organizations such as the salvation army volunteers dressed as santa claus typically became part of fundraising drives to aid needy families at christmas time in 1937 charles w howard who played santa claus in department stores and parades established the charles w howard santa school the oldest continuouslyrun such school in the world42 in some images from the early 20th century santa was depicted as personally making his toys by hand in a small workshop like a craftsman eventually the idea emerged that he had numerous elves responsible for making the toys but the toys were still handmade by each individual elf working in the traditional manner the 1956 popular song by george melachrino mrs santa claus and the 1963 childrens book how mrs santa claus saved christmas by phyllis mcginley helped standardize and establish the character and role of mrs claus in the popular imagination seabury quinns 1948 novel roads draws from historical legends to tell the story of santa and the origins of christmas other modern additions to the story of santa include rudolph the rednosed reindeer the 9th and lead reindeer immortalized in a gene autry song written by a montgomery ward copywriter in popular culture see also santacon by the end of the 20th century the reality of mass mechanized production became more fully accepted by the western publiccitation needed elves had been portrayed as using assembly lines to produce toys early in the 20th century that shift was reflected in the modern depiction of santas residence—now often humorously portrayed as a fully mechanized production and distribution facility equipped with the latest manufacturing technology and overseen by the elves with santa and mrs claus as executives andor managers43 an excerpt from a 2004 article from a supply chain managers trade magazine aptly illustrates this depiction santas main distribution center is a sight to behold at 4000000 square feet 370000 m2 its one of the worlds largest facilities a realtime warehouse management

become so commercialized and hooked into manufactured icons santa is much more organic integral connected to the past and therefore connected to the future — tv producer jonathan meath who portrays santa 201145 many television commercials comic strips and other media depict this as a sort of humorous business with santas elves acting as a sometimes mischievously disgruntled workforce cracking jokes and pulling pranks on their boss for instance a bloom county story from 15 december 1981 through 24 december 1981 has santa rejecting the demands of petco professional elves toymaking and craft organization for higher wages a hot tub in the locker room and short broads” with the elves then going on strike president reagan steps in fires all of santas helpers and replaces them with outofwork air traffic controllers an obvious reference to the 1981 air traffic controllers strike resulting in a riot before santa vindictively rehires them in humiliating new positions such as his reindeer46

storesundue weight – discuss santa tracking santa websites and email to and from santa the christmas issue of noaas weather bureau topics with santa claus streaking across a weather radar screen 1958 over the years there have been a number of websites created by various organizations that have purported to track santa claus some such as norad tracks santa the airservices australia tracks santa project858687 the santa update project and the msnbc and bing maps platform tracks santa project8889 have endured others such as the dallasfort worth international airports tracks santa project909192 the santa retro radar – lehigh valley project93 and the nasa tracks santa project94 have fallen by the wayside 1955 sears ad with the misprinted telephone number that led to the creation of the norad tracks santa program the origins of the norad tracks santa programme began in the united states in 1955 when a sears roebuck store in colorado springs colorado gave children a number to call a santa hotline the number was mistyped resulting in children calling the continental air defense command conad on christmas eve instead the director of operations colonel harry shoup received the first call for santa and responded by telling children that there were signs on the radar that santa was indeed heading south from the north pole a tradition began which continued under the name norad tracks santa when in 1958 canada and the united states jointly created the north american air defense command norad9596 this tracking can now be done via the internet and norads website in the past many local television stations in the united states and canada likewise claimed they tracked santa claus in their own metropolitan areas through the stations meteorologists in december 2000 the weather channel built upon these local efforts to provide a national christmas eve santa tracking effort called santawatch in cooperation with nasa the international space station and silicon valleybased new multimedia firm dreamtime holdings97 in the 21st century most local television stations in the united states and canada rely upon outside established santa tracking efforts such as norad tracks santa98 many other websites became available yearround devoted to santa claus and purport to keep tabs on his activities in his workshop many of these websites also include email addresses which allow children to send email to santa claus most of these websites use volunteer living people as elves to answer email sent to santa some websites such as santas page on microsofts windows live spaces however have used or still use bots to compose and send email replies with occasional unfortunate results99100 the santa claus museum in columbus texas in addition to providing holidaythemed entertainment santa tracking websites raise interest in space technology and exploration101 serve to educate children in geography102 and encourage them to take an interest in science103104 criticism see also christmas controversy calvinist and puritan opposition santa claus has partial christian roots in saint nicholas particularly in the high church denominations that practice the veneration of him in addition to other saints in light of this the character has sometimes been the focus of controversy over the holiday and its meanings some christians particularly calvinists and puritans disliked the idea of santa claus as well as christmas in general believing that the lavish celebrations were not in accordance with their faith105 other nonconformist christians condemn the materialist focus of contemporary gift giving and see santa claus as the symbol of that culture106 condemnation of christmas was prevalent among the 17thcentury english puritans and dutch calvinists who banned the holiday as either pagan or roman catholic the american colonies established by these groups reflected this view tolerance for christmas increased after the restoration but the puritan opposition to the holiday persisted in new england for almost two centuries107 in the dutch new netherland colony season celebrations focused on new years day excerpt from josiah kings the examination and tryal of father christmas 1686 published shortly after christmas was reinstated as a holy day in england folger shakespeare library washington dc following the restoration of the monarchy and with puritans out of power in england108 the ban on christmas was satirized in works such as josiah kings the examination and tryal of old father christmas together with his clearing by the jury 1686109 reverend paul nedergaard a clergyman in copenhagen denmark attracted controversy in 1958 when he declared santa to be a pagan goblin translated from danish after santas image was used on fundraising materials for a danish welfare organization clar 337 a number of denominations of christians have varying concerns about santa claus which range from acceptance to denouncement110111 mary baker eddy the founder of the christian science movement wrote the children should not be taught that santa claus has aught to do with this christmas pastime a deceit or falsehood is never wise too much cannot be done towards guarding and guiding well the germinating and inclining thought of childhood to mould aright the first impressions of innocence aids in perpetuating purity and in unfolding the immortal model man in his image and likeness112 opposition under state atheism under the marxist–leninist doctrine of state atheism in the soviet union after its foundation in 1917 christmas celebrations—along with other religious holidays—were prohibited as a result of the soviet antireligious campaign113114 the league of militant atheists encouraged school pupils to campaign against christmas traditions among them being santa claus and the christmas tree as well as other christian holidays including easter the league established an antireligious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement115116 symbol of commercialism in his book nicholas the epic journey from saint to santa claus writer jeremy seal describes how the commercialization of the santa claus figure began in the 19th century in the 1820s he began to acquire the recognizable trappings reindeer sleigh bells said seal in an interview117 they are simply the actual bearings in the world from which he emerged at that time sleighs were how you got about manhattan writing in mothering writer carol jeanswanson makes similar points noting that the original figure of st nicholas gave only to those who were needy and that today santa claus seems to be more about conspicuous consumption our jolly old saint nicholas reflects our culture to a t for he is fanciful exuberant bountiful overweight and highly commercial he also mirrors some of our highest ideals childhood purity and innocence selfless giving unfaltering love justice and mercy what child has ever received a coal for christmas the problem is that in the process he has become burdened with some of societys greatest challenges materialism corporate greed and domination by the media here santa carries more in his baggage than toys alone118 in the czech republic a group of advertising professionals started a website against santa claus a relatively recent phenomenon in that country119 czech christmases are intimate and magical all that santa stuff seems to me like cheap show business said david könig of the creative copywriters club pointing out that it is primarily an american and british tradition im not against santa himself im against santa in my country only in the czech tradition presents are delivered by ježíšek which translates as baby jesus in the united kingdom father christmas was historically depicted wearing a green cloakcitation needed as father christmas has been increasingly merged into the image of santa claus that has been changed to the more commonly known red suit120 one school in the seaside town of brighton banned the use of a red suit erroneously believing it was only indicative of the cocacola advertising campaign school spokesman sarah james said the redsuited santa was created as a marketing tool by cocacola it is a symbol of commercialism121 however santa had been portrayed in a red suit in the 19th century by thomas nast among others122 controversy about deceiving children see also paternalistic deception various psychologists and researchers have wrestled with the ways that parents collude to convince young children of the existence of santa claus and have wondered whether childrens abilities to critically weigh realworld evidence may be undermined by their belief in this or other imaginary figures for example university of texas psychology professor jacqueline woolley helped conduct a study that found to the contrary that children seemed competent in their use of logic evidence and comparative reasoning even though they might conclude that santa claus or other fanciful creatures were real the adults they count on to provide reliable information about the world introduce them to santa then his existence is affirmed by friends books tv and movies it is also validated by hard evidence the halfeaten cookies and empty milk glasses by the tree on christmas morning in other words children do a great job of scientifically evaluating santa and adults do a great job of duping them123 — jacqueline wooley woolley posited that it is perhaps kinship with the adult world that causes children not to be angry that they were lied to for so long123 however the criticism about this deception is not that it is a simple lie but a complicated series of very large lies124 objections include that it is unethical for parents to lie to children without good cause and that it discourages healthy skepticism in children124 with no greater good at the heart of the lie some have charged that it is more about the parents than it is about the children for instance writer austin cline posed the question is it not possible that kids would find at least as much pleasure in knowing that parents are responsible for christmas not a supernatural stranger124 others however see no harm in the belief in santa claus psychologist tamar murachver said that because it is a cultural not parental lie it does not undermine parental trust125 the new zealand skeptics also see no harm in parents telling their children that santa is real spokesperson vicki hyde said it would be a hardhearted parent indeed who frowned upon the innocent joys of our childrens cultural heritage we save our bah humbugs for the things that exploit the vulnerable125 dr john condry of cornell university interviewed more than 500 children for a study of the issue and found that not a single child was angry at his or her parents for telling them santa claus was real according to dr condry the most common response to finding out the truth was that they felt older and more mature they now knew something that the younger kids did not126 see also christmas portal holidays portal mythology portal christmas controversy yes virginia there is a santa claus flying santa—a
