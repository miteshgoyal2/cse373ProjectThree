family stone were pioneers of late 1960s and early 70s funk their fusion of rb rhythms infectious melodies and psychedelia created a new popsoulrock hybrid the impact of which has proven lasting and widespread motown producer norman whitfield for example patterned the labels forays into harderdriving socially relevant material such as the temptations runaway child and ball of confusion based on their sound the pioneering precedent of stones racial sexual and stylistic mix had a major influence in the 1980s on artists such as prince and rick james legions of artists from the 1990s forward –

five singles hot fun in the summertime and thank you falettinme be mice elf agin everybody is a star before the end of the year and appearing at woodstock from the moment the group began touring following the success of dance to the music the family stone drew praise for their explosive live show which attracted equal parts black and white fans when bob marley first played in the us in 1973 with his band the wailers he opened on tour for sly and the family stone personal problems and declineedit with the bands newfound fame and success came numerous problems relationships within the band were deteriorating there was friction in particular between the stone brothers and larry graham6 epic requested more marketable output7 the black panther party demanded that stone make his music more militant and more reflective of the black power movement7 replace greg errico and jerry martini with black instrumentalists and replace manager david kapralik8 after moving to the los angeles area in fall 1969 stone and his bandmates became heavy users of illegal drugs primarily cocaine and pcp9 as the members became increasingly focused on drug use and partying stone carried a violin case filled with illegal drugs wherever he went10 recording slowed significantly between summer 1969 and fall 1971 the band released only one single thank you falettinme be mice elf agineverybody is a star released in december 1969 the former song was one of the first recordings to employ the heavy funky beats that would be featured in the funk music of the following decade it showcased bass player larry grahams innovative percussive playing technique of bass slapping graham later said that he developed this technique in an earlier band in order to compensate for that bands lack of a drummer11 thank you reached the top of the billboard hot 100 in february 1970 the single also peaked at 5 on the rb chart and remained there for five weeks while also remaining at 1 on the pop chart for two weeks in the spring of 1970 before selling over a million copies12 having relocated to los angeles with his then girlfriend deborah king later deborah santana wife of carlos santana from 1973 until filing for divorce in 2007 stones behavior became increasingly erratic epic was anticipating new material in 1970 but with none forthcoming finally released greatest hits that november one year later the bands fifth album theres a riot goin on was released riot featured a much darker sound as most tracks were recorded with overdubbing as opposed to the family stone all playing at the same time as they had done previously stone played most of the parts himself and performed more of the lead vocals than usual this was the first major label album to feature a drum machine the bands cohesion slowly began to erode and its sales and popularity began to decline as well errico withdrew from the group in 1971 and was eventually replaced with andy newmark larry graham and stone were no longer on friendly terms and graham was fired in early 1972 and replaced with rustee allen the bands later releases fresh 1973 and small talk 1974 featured even less of the band and more of stone live bookings for sly the family stone had steadily dropped since 1970 because promoters were afraid that stone or one of the band members might miss the gig refuse to play or pass out from drug use13 these issues were regular occurrences for the band during the 1970s and had an adverse effect on their ability to demand money for live bookings13 at many of these gigs concertgoers rioted if the band failed to show up or if stone walked out before finishing his set ken roberts became the groups promoter and later their general manager when no other representatives would work with the band because of their erratic gig attendance record14 in january 1975 the band booked itself at radio city music hall in new york the famed music hall was only oneeighth occupied and stone and company had to scrape together money to return home15 following the radio city engagement the band was dissolved15 rose stone was pulled out of the band by bubba banks who was by then her husband she began a solo
