train can be traced to 1965 when wciutv an upstart uhf station in chicago began airing two youthoriented dance programs kiddieagogo and red hot and blues these programs—specifically the latter which featured a predominantly africanamerican group of instudio dancers—would set the stage for what was to come to the station several years later don cornelius a news reader and backup disc jockey at chicago radio station wvon was hired by wciu in 1967 as a news and sports reporter cornelius also was promoting and emceeing a touring series of concerts featuring local talent sometimes called record hops at chicagoarea high schools calling his traveling caravan of shows the soul train wciutv took notice of corneliuss outside work and in 1970 allowed him the opportunity to bring his road show to television after securing a sponsorship deal with the chicagobased retailer sears roebuck co soul train premiered on wciutv on august 17 1970 as a live show airing weekday afternoons the first episode of the program featured jerry butler the chilites and the emotions as guests cornelius was assisted by clinton ghent a local professional dancer who appeared on early episodes before moving behind the scenes as a producer and secondary host1 move to syndicationedit soul train host don cornelius second from right with the staple singers in 1974 the programs immediate success attracted the attention of another locally based firm—the johnson products company manufacturers of the afro sheen line of haircare products—and they later agreed to cosponsor the programs expansion into national syndication cornelius and soul trains syndicator targeted 24 markets outside of chicago to carry the show but stations in only eight other cities—atlanta birmingham cleveland detroit houston los angeles philadelphia and san francisco—purchased the program which began airing on a weekly basis on october 2 1971 by the end of the first season soul train was on in the other sixteen markets2 when the program moved into syndication its home base was also shifted to los angeles where it remained for the duration of its run soul train was part of a national trend toward syndicated musicoriented programs targeted at niche audiences two other network series hee haw for country music and the lawrence welk show for traditional music also entered syndication in 1971 and would go on to have long runs though don cornelius moved his operations west soul train continued in chicago as a local program cornelius hosted the local chicago and los angeles–based national programs simultaneously but soon focused his attention solely on the national edition he continued to oversee production in chicago where clinton ghent hosted episodes on wciutv until 1976 followed by three years of onceweekly reruns3 the syndicated version was picked up in chicago by cbsowned wbbmtv at its launch the program moved to wgntv in 1977 and remained there for the rest of its run in 1985 chicagobased tribune entertainment wgns syndication wing took over soul trains syndication contract the series would continue distribution through tribune for the rest of its original run most of the stations that aired soul train during the final 13 years were either fox affiliates or independent stations that would later become wb network affiliates upn affiliates or both dual wbupn affiliates later yearsedit don cornelius ended his run as host at the end of the shows 22nd season in 1993 though he remained the shows main creative force from behind the scenes the following fall soul train began using various guest hosts weekly until comedian mystro clark began a twoyear stint as permanent host in 1997 clark was replaced by actor shemar moore in 2000 in 2003 moore was succeeded by actor dorian gregory who hosted through 2006 soul train pulled into its last stop when production of firstrun episodes was suspended at the conclusion of the 2005–06 season the shows 35th instead for two seasons starting in 2006–07 the program aired archived episodes all from between 1973 and 1988 under the title the best of soul train4 this was because in later years nielsen ratings dropped to below 10 in the process some of the stations which had been airing soul train on saturday afternoons started rescheduling the program to overnight time slots the future of soul train was uncertain with the announced closing of tribune entertainment in december 2007 which left don cornelius productions to seek a new distributor for the program5 cornelius soon secured a deal with trifecta entertainment media revivaledit when don cornelius productions still owned the program clips of the shows performances and interviews were kept away from online video sites such as youtube owing to copyright infringement claimscitation needed cornelius also frowned upon unauthorized distribution of soul train episodes through the sale of thirdparty vhs or dvd compilations in may 2008 cornelius sold the rights to the soul train library to madvision entertainment whose principal partners came from the entertainment and publishing fields the price and terms of the deal were not disclosed6 however by the start of the 2008–09 television season the tribune broadcastingowned stations including national carrier wgn america that had been the linchpin of the shows syndication efforts dropped the program and many others followed suit soul trains website acknowledged that the program had ceased distribution on september 22 2008 following the purchase by madvision the soul train archives were exposed to new forms of distribution in april 2009 madvision launched a soul train channel on youtube three months later the company entered into a licensing agreement with time–life to distribute soul train dvd sets78 madvision then came to terms with viacomowned black entertainment television to relaunch the soul train music awards for bets new spinoff channel centric in november 2009 a move that may be one step into reviving the program centric which launched on september 28 2009 is currently broadcasting archived episodes of the program archived episodes of the series can also be seen on bounce tv an atlantabased television network that launched on september 26 2011 madvision sold the rights to soul train to a consortium led by basketball player earvin magic johnson and backed by private equity firm intermedia partners in 2011 the johnsonintermedia consortium plans on a potential film project cornelius had briefly mentioned prior to selling the franchise as well as producing potential stage adaptations and a cruise9 as part of the sale johnsons aspire tv channel also began airing reruns of the series cornelius continued to appear for soul train documentaries and ceremonies up until his death from suicide in february 2012 in 2013 a cruisebased revival called the soul train cruise began taking place the cruise is presented by centric10 influenceedit some commentators have called soul train a black american bandstand another longrunning program with which soul train shares some similarities cornelius acknowledged bandstand as a model for his program as the years advanced and soul train evolved into a tradition in its own right he tended to bristle at the bandstand comparisons11 in 1973 dick clark host and producer of bandstand launched soul unlimited — controversial for its pronounced racial overtures — to compete directly with soul train cornelius with help from jesse jackson openly accused clark of trying to undermine tvs only blackowned show agreeing abc canceled it after a few episodes clark later agreed to work with cornelius on a series of network specials featuring rb and soul artists12 cornelius was relatively conservative in his musical tastes and was admittedly not a fan of the emerging hip hop genre believing that the genre did not reflect positively on africanamerican culture one of his stated goals for the series even though cornelius would feature rap artists on soul train frequently during the 1980s he publicly would admit to the artists faces such as kurtis blow that the genre was one that he did not understand as rap continued to move further toward hardcore hip hop cornelius would admit to be frightened by the antics of groups such as public enemy rosie perez testified in the 2010 vh1 documentary soul train the hippest trip in america that cornelius also disliked seeing the shows dancers perform sexually suggestive east coast dance moves cornelius admittedly had rap artists on the show only because the genre was becoming popular among his africanamerican audience though the decision alienated middleaged more affluent african americans like himself this disconnect which was openly mocked in an in living color sketch where cornelius and the show were lampooned as extremely old and out of touch eventually led to corneliuss stepping down as host in the early 1990s and the shows losing its influence13 ahmir questlove thompson drummer for hiphop band the roots and a fan of the program authored soul train the music dance and style of a generation isbn 9780062288387  which was published in 201314 program elementsedit within the structure of the program there were two enduring elements the first was the soul train scramble board where two dancers are given 60 seconds to unscramble a set of letters that form the name of that shows performer or a notable person in african american history in describing the persons renown the host concluded their description with the phrase whose name you should know cornelius openly admitted after the series ended its run that the game was usually set up so everybody won in an effort not to cause embarrassment for the show or african americans in general there was also the popular soul train line a variant of the 1950s fad then known as the stroll in which all the dancers form two lines with a space in the middle for dancers to strut down and dance in consecutive order originally this consisted of a couple—with men on one side and women on the other in later years men and women had their own individual lineups sometimes new dance styles or moves were featured or introduced by particular dancers in addition there was an instudio group of dancers who danced along to the music as it was being performed rosie perez damita jo freeman darnell williams cheryl song louie ski carr alfie lewis alise mekhail andrea n miles carmen electra nick cannon mc hammer jermaine stewart heather hunter fred rerun berry laurieann gibson pebbles and nfl legend walter payton were among those who got noticed dancing on the program over the years two former dancers jody watley and jeffrey daniel enjoyed years of success as members of the rb group shalamar after they were chosen by soul train talent bookerrecord promoter dick griffey and cornelius to replace the groups original session singers in 197815 each guest usually performed twice on each program after their first number they were joined by the program host onstage for a brief interview the show was also known for two popular catchphrases referring to itself as the hippest trip in america at the beginning of the show and closing the program with and you can bet your last money its gonna be a stone gas honey im don cornelius and as always in parting we wish you love peaceand soul uk versionedit in 1985 cornelius gave permission for a version of the show in the united kingdom the uk version hosted by former soul train dancer jeffrey daniel was titled 620 soul train and only lasted one series spinoffsedit in 1987 soul train launched the soul train music awards which honors the top performances in rb hip hop and gospel music and in its earlier years jazz music from the previous year soul train then produced the shortlived soul train comedy awards in 1993 which discontinued that same year161718 soul train later created two additional annual specials the soul train lady of soul awards first airing in 1995 celebrated top achievements by female performers and the soul train christmas starfest which premiered in 1998 featured holiday music performed by a variety of rb and gospel artists award categories for the soul train lady of soul awards presented to female recipients included19 rbsoul album of the year solo best rbsoul album of the year group or duo rbsoul song of the

franklin award for entertainer of the year and the lena horne award for outstanding career achievements19 the lady of soul awards and christmas starfest programs last aired in 2005 in april 2008 don cornelius announced that years soul train music awards ceremony had been canceled cornelius cited the threemonth strike by the writers guild of america as one of the reasons though a main factor may have been the uncertainty surrounding soul trains future cornelius also announced that a motion picture based on the program was in development20 however subsequent owners of the franchise have followed their own agenda for the program which included a revival of the soul train music awards as of 2009 theme musicedit soul train used various original and current music for theme songs during its run including 1971–1973 soul train hot potato by king curtis curtis ousley and later redone by the rimshots as soul train parts 1 2 the original 1962 version which was used on the show was recorded nine years before the show was named hot potatoes piping hot 1973–1975 tsop the sound of philadelphia composed by gamble and huff and recorded by mfsb with vocals by the three degrees
