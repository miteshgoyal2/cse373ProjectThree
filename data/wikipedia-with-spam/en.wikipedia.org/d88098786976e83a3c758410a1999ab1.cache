were afraid to tell their parents about their condition i spent hours hearing the grief of women who had been physically and emotionally clobbered by an abusive husband i saw the anguish in the faces of an elderly couple when their declining health forced them to sell their home give up their independence and move into a longtermcare facility i listened to countless young couples pour out their
