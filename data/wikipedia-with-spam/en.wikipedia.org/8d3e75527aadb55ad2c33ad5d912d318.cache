horse159 prescription drug addiction on october 3 2003 the national enquirer reported that limbaugh was being investigated for illegally obtaining the prescription drugs oxycodone and hydrocodone other news outlets quickly confirmed the investigation160 he admitted to listeners on his radio show on october 10 2003 that he was addicted to prescription painkillers and stated that he would enter inpatient treatment for 30 days immediately after the broadcast161 limbaugh stated his addiction to painkillers resulted from several years of severe back pain heightened by a botched surgery intended to correct those problems a subsequent investigation into whether limbaugh had violated floridas doctor shopping laws was launched by the palm beach state attorney which raised privacy issues when investigators seized limbaughs private medical records looking for evidence of crimes roy black one of limbaughs attorneys stated that rush limbaugh was singled out for prosecution because of who he is we believe the state attorneys office is applying a double standard162 on november 9 2005 following two years of investigations assistant state attorney james l martz requested that the court set aside limbaughs doctor–patient confidentiality rights and allow the state to question his physicians163 limbaughs attorney opposed the prosecutors efforts to interview his doctors on the basis of patient privacy rights and argued that the prosecutor had violated limbaughs fourth amendment rights by illegally seizing his medical records the american civil liberties union issued a statement in agreement and filed an amicus curiae brief in support of limbaugh164165 on december 12 2005 judge david f crow delivered a ruling prohibiting the state of florida from questioning limbaughs physicians about the medical condition of the patient and any information disclosed to the health care practitioner by the patient in the course of the care and treatment of the patient166 on april 28 2006 a

handcuffed he was then released after about an hour on 3000 bail167168169 after his surrender he filed a not guilty plea to the charge prosecutors explained that the charges were brought after they discovered he received about 2000 painkillers prescribed by four doctors in six months at a pharmacy near his palm beach mansion in 2009 after 3 years of prolonged discussion regarding a settlement prosecutors agreed to drop the charge if limbaugh paid 30000 to defray the cost of the investigation completed an 18month therapy regimen with his physician submitted to random drug testing and gave up his right to own a firearm for eighteen months170 limbaugh agreed to the settlement though he continued to maintain his innocence of doctor shopping and asserted that the states offer resulted from a lack of evidence supporting the charge171 before his addiction became known limbaugh had condemned illegal drug use on his television program stating that drug use some might say is destroying this country and so if people are violating the law by doing drugs they ought to be accused and they ought to be convicted and they ought to be sent up172173 in june 2006 limbaugh was detained by drug enforcement agents at palm beach international airport customs officials confiscated viagra from limbaughs luggage as he was returning from the dominican republic the prescription was not in limbaughs

stated that i had a great time in the dominican republic wish i could tell you about it174 cigar aficionado in the early 1990s when the cigar boom was gaining momentum limbaugh was seen frequently

work on december 19 2001 doctors at the house ear clinic in los angeles were able to successfully restore a measure of his hearing through cochlear implant surgery limbaugh received a clarion cii
