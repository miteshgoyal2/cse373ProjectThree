predecessors had been very dominant against the competition and were hugely profitable for sony playstation 3 had an inauspicious start and sony chairman and ceo sir howard stringer initially could not convince investors of a turnaround in its fortunes the ps3 lacked the unique gameplay of the more affordable wii which became that generations most successful console in terms of units sold furthermore ps3 had to compete directly with xbox 360 which had a market head start and as a result the platform no longer had exclusive titles that the ps2 enjoyed such as the grand theft auto and final fantasy series regarding crossplatform games xbox 360 versions were generally considered superior in 2006 although by 2008 the ps3 versions had reached parity or surpassed199 and it took longer than expected for ps3 to enjoy strong sales and close the gap with xbox 360 sony also continued to lose money on each ps3 sold through 2010200 although the redesigned slim ps3 has cut these losses since then201 playstation 3s initial production cost is estimated by isuppli to have been us80585 for the 20 gb model and us84035 for the 60 gb model202 however they were priced at us499 and us599 respectively meaning that units may have been sold at an estimated loss of 306 or 241 depending on model if the cost estimates were correct203 and thus may have contributed to sonys games division posting an operating loss of ¥2323 billion us197 billion in the fiscal year ending march 2007204 in april 2007 soon after these results were published ken kutaragi president of sony computer entertainment announced plans to retire various news agencies including the times205 and the wall street journal206 reported that this was due to poor sales while scei maintains that kutaragi had been planning his retirement for six months prior to the announcement206 in january 2008 kaz hirai ceo of sony computer entertainment suggested that the console may start making a profit by early 2009 stating that the next fiscal year starts in april and if we can try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing and that profitability is not a definite commitment but that is what i would like to try to shoot for207 however market analysts nikko citigroup have predicted that playstation 3 could be profitable by august 2008208 in a july 2008 interview hirai stated that his objective is for playstation 3 to sell 150 million units by its ninth year surpassing playstation 2s sales of 140 million in its nine years on the market209 in january 2009 sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in q3 2008210 since the systems launch production costs have been reduced significantly as a result of phasing out the emotion engine chip and falling hardware costs211212 the cost of manufacturing cell microprocessors has fallen dramatically as a result of moving to the 65 nm production process212213 and bluray disc diodes have become cheaper to manufacture211214 as of january 2008 each unit cost around 400 to manufacture215216 by august 2009 sony had reduced costs by a total of 70 meaning it only costs sony around 240 per unit217218219 critical reception early playstation 3 reviews after launch were critical of its high price and lack of quality games game developers regarded the architecture as difficult to program for ps3 was however commended for its hardware including its bluray home theater capabilities and graphics potential220221 critical and commercial reception to ps3 improved over time after a series of price revisions blurays victory over hd dvd222 and the release of several well received titles ars technicas original launch review gave ps3 only a 610 but second review of the console in june 2008 rated it a 910223 in september 2009 ign named playstation 3 the 15th best gaming console of all time behind both of its competitors wii 10th and xbox 360 6th224 however ps3 has won igns console showdown—based on which console offers the best selection of games released during each year—in three of the four years since it began 2008 2009 and 2011 with xbox winning in 2010225 ign judged playstation 3 to have the best game lineup of 2008 based on their review scores in comparison to those of wii and xbox 360226 in a comparison piece by pc magazines will greenwald in june 2012 ps3 was selected as an overall better console compared to xbox 360227 pocketlint said of the console the ps3 has always been a brilliant games console and that for now this is just about the best media device for the money146 original model ps3 was given the numbereight spot on pc world magazines list of the top 21 tech screwups of 2006 where it was criticized for being late expensive and incompatible228 gamesradar ranked ps3 as the top item in a feature on gamerelated pr disasters asking how sony managed to take one of the most anticipated game systems of all time and — within the space of a year — turn it into a hate object reviled by the entire internet but added that despite its problems the system has untapped potential229 business week summed up the general opinion by stating that it was more impressed with what the playstation 3 could do than with what it currently does230 developers also found the machine difficult to program for in 2007 gabe newell of valve said the ps3 is a total disaster on so many levels i think its really clear that sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted he continued id say even at this late date they should just cancel it and do a do over just say this was a horrible disaster and were sorry and were going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it231 doug lombardi vp of marketing for valve has since stated that valve is interested in developing for the console and is looking to hire talented ps3 programmers for future projects232 he later restated valves position until we have the ability to get a ps3 team together until we find the people who want to come to valve or who are at valve who want to work on that i dont really see us moving to that platform233 at sonys e3 2010 press conference newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements citing sonys move to make the system more developer friendly and to announce that valve would be developing portal 2 for the system he also claimed that the inclusion of steamworks valves system to automatically update their software independently would help to make the ps3 version of portal 2 the best console version on the market activision blizzard ceo bobby kotick has criticized ps3s high development costs and inferior attach rate and return to that of xbox 360 and wii he believes these factors are pushing developers away from working on the console in an interview with the times kotick stated im getting concerned about sony the playstation 3 is losing a bit of momentum and they dont make it easy for me to support the platform234 he continued its expensive to develop for the console and the wii and the xbox are just selling better games generate a better return on invested capital roic on the xbox than on the playstation kotick also claimed that activision blizzard may stop supporting the system if the situation is not addressed sony has to cut the ps3s retail price because if they dont the attach rates are likely to slow if we are being realistic we might have to stop supporting sony235 kotick received heavy criticism for the statement notably from developer bioware who questioned the wisdom of the threatened move and referred to the statement as silly236 despite the initial negative press several websites have given the system very good reviews mostly regarding its hardware cnet united kingdom praised the system saying the ps3 is a versatile and impressive piece of homeentertainment equipment that lives up to the hype the ps3 is well worth its hefty price tag237 cnet awarded it a score of 88 out of 10 and voted it as its number one musthave gadget238 praising its robust graphical capabilities and stylish exterior design while criticizing its limited selection of available games239 in addition both home theater magazine and ultimate av have given the systems bluray playback very favorable reviews stating that the quality of playback exceeds that of many current standalone bluray disc players240241 in an interview kazuo hirai chairman of sony computer entertainment argued for the choice of a complex architecture242 hexus gaming reviewed the pal version and summed the review up by saying as the playstation 3 matures and developers start really pushing it well see the playstation 3 emerge as the console of choice for gaming243 at gdc 2007 shiny entertainment founder dave perry stated i think that sony has made the best machine its the best piece of hardware without question244 slim model and rebranding the playstation 3 slim received extremely positive reviews as well as a boost in sales less than 24 hours after its announcement ps3 slim took the numberone bestseller spot on amazoncom in the video games section for fifteen consecutive days it regained the numberone position again one day later245 ps3 slim also received praise from pc world giving it a 90 out of 100 praising its new repackaging and the new value it brings at a lower price as well as praising its quietness and the reduction in its power consumption this is in stark contrast to the original ps3s launch in which it was given position numbereight on their the top 21 tech screwups of 2006 list246 cnet awarded ps3 slim four out of five stars praising its bluray capabilities 120 gb hard drive free online gaming service and more affordable pricing point but complained about the lack of backward compatibility for playstation 2 games247 techradar gave ps3 slim four and a half stars out of five praising its new smaller size and summed up its review stating over all the ps3 slim is a phenomenal piece of kit its amazing that something so small can do so much however they criticized the exterior design and the build quality in relation to the original model248 eurogamer called it a product where the costcutting has – by and large – been tastefully done and said its nothing short of a massive win for sony249 super slim model the super slim model of ps3 has received positive reviews gaming website spong praised the new super slims quietness stating the most noticeable noise comes when the drive seeks a new area of the disc such as when starting to load a game and this occurs infrequently they added that the fans are quieter than that of slim and went on to praise the new smaller lighter size criticism was placed on the new disc loader stating the cover can be moved by hand if you wish theres also an eject button to do the work for you but there is no software eject from the triangle button menus in the xross media bar xmb interface in addition you have to close the cover by hand which can be a bit fiddly if its upright and the ps3 wont start reading a disc unless you do close the cover they also said there is no real drop in retail price250 tech media website cnet gave new super slim 4 out of 5 stars excellent saying the super slim playstation 3 shrinks a powerful gaming machine into an even tinier package while maintaining the same features as its predecessors a great gaming library and a strong array of streaming services whilst also criticising the cheap design and discloader stating sometimes the cover doesnt catch and you feel like youre using one of those old credit card imprinter machines in short it feels cheap you dont realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until theyre gone whether it was to cut costs or save space this move is ultimately a step back the criticism also was due to price stating the cheapest super slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest slim model and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive shouldnt be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a slim model is easily removed and replaced they did praise that the hard drive of the super slim model is the easiest yet simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay which can quickly be unscrewed they also stated that whilst the super slim model is not in any way an upgrade it could be an indicator as to whats to come it may not be revolutionary but the super slim ps3 is the same impressive machine in a much smaller package there doesnt seem to be any reason for existing ps3 owners to upgrade but for the prospective ps3 buyer the super slim is probably the way to go if you can deal with not having a slotloading disc drive251 pocketlint gave super slim a very positive review saying its much more affordable brilliant gaming secondtonone video and media player they think it is a blinding good console and one that will serve you for years to come with secondhand games and even new releases without doubt if you dont have a ps3 this is the time to buy they gave super slim 4 and a half stars out of 5146 technology magazine t3 gave the super slim model a positive review stating the console is almost nostalgic in the design similarities to the original fat model while we dont know whether it will play ps3 games or bluray discs any differently yet the look and feel of the new ps3 slim is an obvious homage to the original ps3 minus the considerable excess weight immediately we would be concerned about the durability of the top loading tray that feels like it could be yanked straight out off the console but ultimately it all feels like sonys nostalgic way of signing off the current generation console in anticipation for the ps4252 notes initially used hdmi 13a specification94 but was upgraded to 14 with the introduction of stereoscopic 3d for gaming and bluray playback via firmware update the playstation 3 does not currently support any other hdmi 14 capabilities references
