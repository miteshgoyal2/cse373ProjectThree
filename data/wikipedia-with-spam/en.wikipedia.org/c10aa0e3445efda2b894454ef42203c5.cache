and marty bandiers the entertainment company had made a tentative agreement with holmes à court to buy atv music for 50 million however in early august holmes à courts team contacted jackson and talks

funk pieces billie jean and wanna be startin somethin and the disco set baby be mine and pyt pretty young thing2383384385 with thriller christopher connelly of rolling stone commented that jackson

somethin383 in billie jean jackson sings about an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered a child of hers2 in wanna be startin somethin he argues against gossip and the media385 beat it decried gang

media help in bad jacksons concept of the predatory lover can be seen on the rock song dirty diana389 the lead single i just cant stop loving you is a traditional love ballad while man in the mirror is an anthemic ballad of confession and resolution smooth criminal is an evocation of bloody assault rape and likely murder137 allmusics stephen thomas erlewine states that dangerous presents jackson as a paradoxical individual390 he comments the album is more diverse than his previous bad as it appeals to an urban audience while also attracting the middle class with anthems like heal the world390 the first half of the record is dedicated to new jack swing including songs like jam and remember the time391 it was the first jackson album in which social ills become a primary theme why you wanna trip on me for example protests world hunger aids homelessness and drugs391 dangerous contains sexually charged songs such as the multifaceted love song in the closet391 the title track continues the theme of the predatory lover and compulsive desire391 the second half includes introspective popgospel anthems such as will you be there heal the world and keep the faith these songs show jackson opening up about various personal struggles and worries391 in the ballad gone too soon jackson gives tribute to his friend ryan white and the plight of those with aids392 history creates an atmosphere of paranoia393 its content focuses on the hardships and public struggles jackson went through prior to its production in the new jack swingfunkrock tracks scream and tabloid junkie and the rb ballad you are not alone jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels and directs much of his anger at the media394 in the introspective ballad stranger in moscow jackson laments over his fall from grace while songs like earth song childhood little susie and smile are operatic pop pieces393394 in the track ds jackson launched a verbal attack against the lawyer tom sneddon who had prosecuted him in both child sexual abuse cases he describes sneddon as an antisocial white supremacist who wanted to get my ass dead or alive of the song sneddon said i have not—shall we say—done him the honor of listening to it but ive been told that it ends with the sound of a gunshot395 invincible found jackson working heavily with producer rodney jerkins2 the album comprises urban soul tracks such as cry and the lost children ballads such as speechless break of dawn and butterflies and mixes hip hop pop and rb in 2000 watts heartbreaker and invincible396397 vocal style jackson sang from childhood and over time his voice and vocal style changed noticeably between 1971 and 1975 his voice descended from boy soprano to high tenor398 his vocal range as an adult was f2e♭6 jackson first used the vocal hiccup technique similar to gulping for air or gasping in 1973 with the song its too late to change the time from the jackson 5s album git get it together399 jackson did not use the technique fully until the recording of off the wall it can be seen in full force in the shake your body down to the ground promotional video52 with the arrival of off the wall in the late 1970s jacksons abilities as a vocalist were well regarded at the time rolling stone compared his vocals to the breathless dreamy stutter of stevie wonder and wrote that jacksons featherytimbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful it slides smoothly into a startling falsetto thats used very daringly377400 1982 saw the release of thriller and rolling stone was of the opinion that jackson was then singing in a fully adult voice that was tinged by sadness385 a distinctive deliberate mispronunciation of come on used frequently by jackson occasionally spelled cmon chamone or shamone is also a staple in impressions and caricatures of him401 the turn of the 1990s saw the release of the introspective album dangerous the new york times noted that on some tracks he gulps for breath his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper hissing through clenched teeth and he had a wretched tone391 when singing of brotherhood or selfesteem the musician would return to smooth vocals391 of invincible rolling stone was of the opinion that at age 43 jackson still performed exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies402 nelson george wrote the grace the aggression the growling the natural boyishness the falsetto the smoothness—that combination of elements mark him as a major vocalist386 cultural critic joseph vogel notes that jackson had a distinctive styles is his ability to convey emotion without the use of language there are his trademark gulps grunts gasps cries exclamations he also frequently scats or twists and contorts words until they are barely discernible403 neil mccormick notes that jacksons unorthodox singing style was original and utterly distinctive from his almost ethereal falsetto to his soft sweet midtones his fluid seamless control of often very fast moving series of notes his percussive yet still melodic outbursts ululations and interjections from those spooky teeheehees to grunts and wails unusually for someone coming from a black american soul tradition he did not often sing straight unadorned ballads though when he did from ben to shes out of my life the effect was of a powerful simplicity and truth404 music videos and choreography jackson has been called the king of music videos405 steve huey of allmusic observed how jackson transformed the music video into an art form and a promotional tool through complex story lines dance routines special effects and famous cameo appearances simultaneously breaking down racial barriers2 before thriller jackson struggled to receive coverage on mtv

scope of live stage show that jackson lipsynced billie jean is in itself not extraordinary but the fact that it did not change the impact of the performance is extraordinary whether the performance

unique to jackson while the group dance sequence in beat it has frequently been imitated411 the choreography in thriller has become a part of global pop culture replicated everywhere from indian films
