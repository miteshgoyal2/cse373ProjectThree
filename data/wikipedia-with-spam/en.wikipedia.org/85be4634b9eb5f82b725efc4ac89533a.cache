appearances making him the clubs fifth alltime top scorer in the 1959–60 season they achieved tenth position in the first division which until finishing ninth in the 2003–04 season was their highestever league position this accompanied another appearance in the last four of the fa cup in 1962 by this time the club were regularly playing in front of 30000 plus crowds at craven cottage20 despite struggling in the league the club experienced several close escapes from relegation none more spectacular than in 1965–66 when the club rooted at the bottom went on an astounding run beating all the top sides with a few games to go21 on the morning of 26 february 1966 fulham had just 15 points from 29 matches the last 13 games saw fulham win nine and draw two to reach safety eventually however the club suffered relegation in the 1967–68 season having won just ten out of their 42 games even that however was not as catastrophic as the calamity of next season winning only seven in 42

captain25 with many being earned while playing for fulham in the second division haynes was injured in a car accident in blackpool in 1962 but by his own admissions never regained the fitness or form to play for england again missing out on englands victory in the fifa world cup 1966 for which he would have stood a chance of being selected26 the stevenage road stand was renamed in his honour after his death in a car crash in 2005 1970–94 mixed fortunes outside the top flightedit the aforementioned third division hiatus lasted only two seasons before the club was promoted back to the second division as runnersup in 1970–71 this spell also saw fulham invited to the angloitalian cup which saw the club draw four out of four games in 1972–73 season this preceded a period of highprofile signings for the club under alec stock in the mid1970s including alan mullery and bobby moore fulham reached their only fa cup final in 1975 having won their first semifinal in five attempts the club then lost to west ham united in the final this gained the club qualification to another european tournament the angloscottish cup where they made the final losing to middlesbrough 1969–71 football

16 games this capped one of the most successful eras in fulham history the club were relegated again after winning only 11 in 42 matches in the 1979–80 season which eventually resulted in bobby campbells sacking in october 1980 to be replaced by malcolm macdonald with a strong squad during his 1980–1984 period in charge with players such as ray houghton tony gale paul parker gerry peyton and ray lewington they won promotion again in 1981–82 back to the second division although the promotion was overshadowed by the suicide of former defender dave clement a few weeks before promotion was sealed in 1980 fulham founded the rugby league club that is now london broncos designed to be an extra stream of income for the football club but which made financial losses every year while linked to fulham fc then called fulham rugby league they played at craven cottage until moving away from the parent club in 1984 in 1978 fulham had signed gordon ivor davies who during two spells at fulham became the clubs leading goalscorer of all time with a total of 178 goals in all competitions the record still stands fulham narrowly missed out on backtoback promotions to the first division losing 1–0 to derby county away on the last day of the 1982–83 season – although the match was abandoned after 88 minutes due to a pitch invasion and inexplicably never replayed or finished the side which had shown so much promise was quickly sold off as the club were in debt so it was little surprise when the club were relegated again to the third division in 1986 the club nearly went out of business in 1987 via an illadvised merger attempt with queens park rangers it was only the intervention of explayer jimmy hill that allowed the club to stay in business as a restructured fulham fc 1987 ltd in

capacities for a short while in february 1996 micky adams became playermanager adams oversaw an upturn in form that lifted the side out of relegation danger the next season he engineered a secondplace league finish missing out on first place because several years previously the league had dropped the old goal difference system in favour of a goals scored tally meaning fulham finished behind wigan

ray wilkins as first team manager and kevin keegan as chief operating officer30 pledging that the club would reach the premier league within five years after an argument over team selection wilkins left the club in may 1998 to hand over the full managerial duties to keegan who helped steer the club to promotion the next season winning 101 points out of a possible 138 after spending £11 million to sign paul peschisolido from west bromwich albion who was top scorer and captained by chris coleman – then the most expensive footballer outside the top two divisions of the english league in 1999 keegan left fulham to become manager of england and paul bracewell was put in charge bracewell was sacked in march 2000 as fulhams promising early season form dwindled away to a midtable finish

would not return to the cottage after it was revealed that alfayed had sold the first right to build on the ground to a property development firm31 in 2002–03 fulham spent most of the season in the lower half of the table chairman alfayed told manager jean tigana that his contract would not be renewed at the end of the season however with five games left to play and relegation still possible tigana was sacked and chris coleman was temporarily put in charge fulham won ten points from a possible 15 and managed to avoid relegation coleman was appointed manager on a permanent basis in the summer of 2003 despite predictions that the inexperience of coleman would result in fulhams relegation32 he kept the club well clear of relegation guiding them to a club record ninthplace finish in his debut season this might have been greater had the club not come under significant financial pressure to sell louis saha to manchester united for whom they received a club record £13 million fulham lost a legal case against former manager tigana in 2004 after alfayed wrongly alleged that tigana had overpaid more than £7 million for new players and had negotiated transfers in secret33 coleman notched up another satisfactory performance in the 2004–05 season and guided fulham to a secure 13thplace finish the following season fulham improved by one place finishing 12th – the high point of the season was a 1–0 win over local rivals and reigning champions chelsea in the west london derby – chelsea had only lost two games in two and a half years the 2006–07 season proved to be colemans

and with fulham in the relegation zone he was dismissed on 21 december 2007 after a defeat to newcastle united34 roy hodgson was named as the new manager of fulham on 28 december 2007 and took up his contractual duties on 30 december35 just two days before the january transfer window opened hodgsons tenure did not start well and it took a month to secure his first win against aston villa courtesy of a jimmy bullard freekick fulham continued to struggle and a 3–1 home defeat in april at the hands of fellow strugglers sunderland left hodgson on the verge of tears in the postmatch press conference and many pundits writing off fulhams survival chances36 despite the negative press hodgson continued to believe survival was attainable the turning point of the season came in the thirdtolast match against manchester city fulham trailed 2–0 at halftime and had the premier league scores at that time become results they would have been relegated however the introduction of diomansy kamara heralded the start of a fantastic comeback—kamara struck twice as fulham registered an amazing 3–2 victory fulham then won a crucial match against fellow strugglers birmingham city at craven cottage leaving survival in the clubs own hands barring a goalrush from fellow strugglers reading a win against a portsmouth side looking ahead to their fourth fa cup final would guarantee survival with 15 minutes to play at portsmouth fulham were drawing and with birmingham city and reading leading comfortably against blackburn rovers and derby county respectively they looked likely to be relegated however fulham earned a freekick with 76 minutes played jimmy bullards delivery found danny murphy who headed home the decisive goal sparking manic celebrations from the travelling fans

europa league the second time that the club had entered a uefa competition 2009–10 was arguably the most successful season in the clubs history they were eliminated from the fa cup in the quarterfinals for the second year running and finished 12th in the premier league despite fielding weakened teams in the last few matches37 in the inaugural europa league season however fulham reached the final meeting spanish club atlético madrid who had dropped down from the champions league at the volksparkstadion in hamburg in their first european cup final the cottagers were beaten 2–1 after extra time having drawn 1–1 after fulltime the achievement of taking fulham so unexpectedly far beating famous teams like hamburger sv juventus holders shakhtar donetsk and basel in the competition led to roy hodgson being voted the lma manager of the year by the widest margin in the history of the award38 the home match in the round of 16 was arguably fulhams greatest result in the history of the club despite losing 3–1 in the first leg at italian giants juventus and falling behind minutes into the second leg at craven cottage fulham scored four goals with no reply from juventus at the end

progressing to the next round fulhams premier league form in the 2011–12 season was mixed with the continuing awayrecord hangover of previous seasons dragging on in october 2011 fulham had an emphatic 6–0 home win over neighbours qpr with andrew johnson scoring a hattrick for fulham in the match42 the january 2012 transfer window saw bobby zamora move over the hammersmith flyover to loftus road
