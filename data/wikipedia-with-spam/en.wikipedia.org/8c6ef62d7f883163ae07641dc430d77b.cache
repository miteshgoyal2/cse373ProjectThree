three were widely viewed as the face of the channels political coverage25 during the first three months of the presidential campaign msnbcs ratings grew by 158 percent26 however during the election

called olbermann msnbcs most recognizable face65 in september 2008 msnbc stated that they were removing both keith olbermann and chris matthews as live political event anchors and replacing them with

january 2012 msnbc used rachel maddow chris matthews and other network commentators during coverage of the 2012 iowa republican caucuses a move seen by nando di fino of the mediaite website as giving up on the straight news coverage and instead appearing to be aiming to create some controversy75 in november 2012 msnbc was called the antifox by the new york times in a feature article that quoted former president bill clinton as saying boy it really has become our liberal version of fox76 the article citing data by the nielsen tv ratings service noted that while fox news pulled in a larger

negative stories about republican presidential candidate john mccain 73 of its coverage vs 57 in the press overall82 msnbcs onair slogan during the week of the 2008 presidential election the power of change was criticized as being overtly similar to obamas campaign slogan of hope and change83 following the 2008 presidential election conservative talk show host john ziegler worked on a documentary titled media malpractice how obama got elected which was very critical of the media especially msnbcs role in the 2008 presidential election while promoting the documentary he engaged in an onair dispute with msnbc news anchor contessa brewer on how the media especially msnbc had portrayed sarah palin84 during msnbcs coverage of the potomac primary msnbcs chris matthews said i have to tell you you know its part of reporting this case this election the feeling most people get when they hear barack obamas speech my i felt this thrill going up my leg i mean i dont have that too often this led
