jackson and martin bashir tour the estates grounds and face off in a race car match later he explains that he writes the songs by composing lyrics and not the music because the music will write itself upon being requested by bashir he demonstrates that through dancing he becomes the physical embodiment of the music afterwards jackson admits that the houses theme of peter pan is so inspirational because he feels he is pan they go out to the giving tree a tree in which jackson gets inspiration to write his songs while watching footage of the jackson 5 he gets emotional upon recalling how his father joe would watch his sons rehearse the dance steps with a belt in his hand he states that he felt a deep fear of his father and that is why he never laid a hand on his children bashir notes that this must have left a deep impact on the young michael after neverland bashir followed him to the four seasons hotel in las vegas in las vegas jackson spoke about his love life his changing appearance and his children when bashir inquires if he had any girlfriends when he was young jackson recounts a time when onetime girlfriend tatum oneal wanted to make love to him but he backed down because he was not ready bashir and jackson also visited a shopping center where jackson reportedly spent over a million dollars in one store on furniture for a new house the subject of his changing appearance is brought up but an agitated jackson denies deliberately bleaching his skin getting implants in his cheeks having a cleft put in his chin having his lips enlarged or getting his eyelids reconstructed claiming that the media is ignorant of what they do not understand jackson mentions he suffered horrible bouts of acne as a teenager and his father would repeatedly insult him by making fun of his nose afterward bashir gets to meet the jackson children prince and paris who wore masks to conceal their appearance jackson then went to berlin germany this is where the baby dangling incident occurred jackson also visited berlin zoo and a charity auction and received a humanitarian award at the bambi awards back in neverland jackson reveals to bashir that not only does he invite disadvantaged children to his ranch he lets them stay in his bed while he sleeps on the floor gavin arvizo is also interviewed and states that it was jacksons support that helped him beat his bout with cancer jackson admits that sometimes when gavin stayed with him jackson let him have the bed while he slept on the floor when asked what he gets out of his involvement with children the singer replies that he gains joy because my greatest inspiration comes from kids after this bashir says he feels uneasy about what he views as an apparent obsession with children he says that he will have to confront jackson on certain areas of his life about which he feels he had been less than honest during january 2003 bashir meets with jackson in miami for the final interview and brings up the subject of his face a visibly upset jackson says that he has only had two operations on his nose1 in order to facilitate his singing to which bashir tries to ask how he looks so much different from when he was an adolescent after the singer states that there is nothing wrong with plastic surgery and that it was not invented for michael jackson bashir comes to the conclusion that jackson wanted to change his appearance as a result of his troubled youth and fathers insults when he asks about a comment jacksons son prince made that i havent got a mother jackson tells him that deborah rowe bore his two children as a gift for him because he wanted to be a father so badly on the subject of blankets mother jackson contradicts his earlier statement that he had blanket with a woman with whom he had a relationship by stating that blankets mother was a surrogate mother and that they did not know each other bashir also repeatedly questions jackson why he invites children into his room jackson defended himself stating that such activity is natural when the children are of close friends or family and that many children including the culkin family children macaulay and kieran have slept in the same bed as him jackson strongly denied that there was any sexual motivation for this during these defensive comments he also stated that he would allow his children to stay with his friends including barry gibb saying that they are sweet people and are not jack the ripper2 due to the confidentiality agreement he refuses to talk about the 1993 allegations but he reveals that he paid the accuser a settlement since he didnt want to go through a long drawnout affair like oj receptionedit criticismedit michael jackson felt betrayed by martin bashir and complained that the film gives a distorted picture of his behavior and conduct as a father34 he said that in the final version of his interview bashir used only that material which supported the negative view bashir portrayed as holding towards jackson in response jackson and his personal cameraman released a rebuttal interview which showed bashir complimenting jackson on his abilities as a father and grace under pressure5 bashir stated i dont believe that ive betrayed michael jackson at all i agreed that we would make an honest film about his life the film was fair to his musical achievement and gave him every opportunity to explain himself im not accusing anybody of being a child molester or a paedophile6 following jacksons death in 2009 bashir said that jackson was never convicted of any crime and i never saw any wrongdoing myself7 rebuttal videoedit in an attempt to repair his image following the martin bashir interview michael jackson released a second interview called take two the footage you were never meant to see also referred to as the rebuttal video which was seen on fox in the united states89 this was presented by maury povich and contains material which bashir omitted it also features new interviews with people close to jackson such as his former wife debbie rowe parents joseph and katherine brother jermaine and close friend elizabeth taylor in this interview she claimed it was on her request that the children wore masks in public she also pointed out that the concept of sharing a bed can be misunderstood for example she herself likes watching television in bed when she has a visitor they both watch television together in bed it also contains interviews with bashir giving much different opinions than he gave in past interviews as well as in the voiceovers he is shown praising jackson as a father as well as saying that he thinks it is wonderful that he allows children to come to neverland though he had made previous statements that neverland ranch was a dangerous place for children5 the footage that they show in this documentary was filmed by hamid moslehi privately he states that he was not secretly videotaping the interviews as was popularly believed he said bashir knew they were also filming but that bashir probably did not know that when he told his camera crew to cut that he was still filming part of the footage was not aired because videographer hamid moslehi refused to hand it over owing to a financial dispute with jackson1011 it was found by police in a search of moslehis home in november 2003 and showed the accusers family praising jackson11 bashir said a 16second clip was being used to portray him as being unfair when he had interviewed jackson for more than 10 hours12 ratingsedit the uk airing had 15 million viewers while 38 million
