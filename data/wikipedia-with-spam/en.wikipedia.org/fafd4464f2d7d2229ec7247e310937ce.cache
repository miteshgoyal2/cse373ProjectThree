contained only in the long form of the decennial census such as ancestry educational attainment income language proficiency migration disability employment and housing characteristics these data are used by many publicsector privatesector and notforprofit stakeholders to allocate funding track shifting demographics plan for emergencies and learn about local communities1 sent to approximately 295000 addresses monthly or 35 million per year it is the largest household survey that the census bureau administers2 contents 1 history 2 implementation 3 data availability 4 controversy 41 support 42 opposition 5 see also 6 references 7 external links historyedit the united states constitution article i section ii requires an enumeration of the population every ten years and “in such manner as they congress shall by law direct” from the first census in 1790 legislators understood that the census should collect basic demographic information beyond the number of people in the household james madison first proposed including questions in the census to “enable them to adapt the public measures to the particular circumstances of the community” such knowledge collected with each census he said “would give them an opportunity of marking the progress of the society3 the number and type of questions included in censuses since 1790 have reflected current american societal trends and the growing nation’s expanded data needs4 by 1940 advancements in statistical methods enabled the census bureau to start asking a sample of the population a subset of additional detailed questions without unduly increasing cost or respondent burden5 in subsequent decades questions that had previously been asked of all respondents as well as new questions moved to the subsample questionnaire form as that form grew longer than the census form sent to most households it became known as the census “long form” following the 1960 census federal state and local government officials as well as those working in the private sector began demanding more timely longformtype data lawmakers representing rural districts claimed they were at a data disadvantage unable to selffund additional surveys of their populations67 congress explored the creation of a middecade census holding hearings and even authorizing a middecade census in 1976 but not funding it8910 efforts to obtain data on a more frequent basis began again after the 1990 census when it became clear that the more burdensome long form was depressing overall census response rates and jeopardizing the accuracy of the count at congresss request the census bureau developed and tested a new design to obtain longform data us statistician leslie kish had introduced the concept of a rolling sample or continuous measurement design in 198111 this design featured ongoing monthly data collection aggregated on a yearly basis enabling annual data releases by combining multiple years of this data the census bureau could release period estimates to produce estimates for smaller areas after a decade of testing it launched as the american community survey in 2005 replacing the onceadecade census long form1213 implementationedit the acs has an initial sample of approximately 35 million housing unit addresses and group quarters in the united states the census bureau selects a random sample of addresses to be included in the acs each address has about a 1in480 chance of being selected in a given month and no address should be selected more than once every five years data are collected by internet mail telephone interviews and inperson interviews approximately one third of those who do not respond to the survey by mail or telephone are randomly selected for inperson interviews about 95 percent of households across all response modes ultimately respond14 like the decennial census acs responses are confidential every employee at the census bureau takes an oath of nondisclosure and is sworn for life to not disclose identifying information violations can result in a 5year prison sentence andor 250000 fine15 under 13 usc § 9 census responses are immune from legal process and may not be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any action suit or other judicial or administrative proceeding data availabilityedit sample of an american community survey data table the census bureau aggregates individual acs responses ie microdata into estimates at many geographic summary levels among these summary levels are legal and administrative entities such as states counties cities and congressional districts as well as statistical entities such as metropolitan statistical areas tracts block groups and census designated places estimates for census blocks are not available from acs16 in order to balance geographic resolution temporal frequency statistical significance and respondent privacy acs estimates released each year are aggregated from responses received in the previous calendar year or previous five calendar years the census bureau provides guidance for data users about which data set to use when analyzing different population and geography sizes17 from 2007 to 2013 3year estimates were available for areas with 20000 people or more this data product was discontinued in 2015 due to budget cuts18 the last 3year release was the 20112013 acs 3year estimates current data releases include 1year estimates are available for areas with a population of at least 65000 people the 2015 acs 1year estimates were released in 2016 and summarize responses received in 2015 for all states but only 26 of counties due to the 65000 minimum population threshold16 this is most suitable for data users interested in shorterterm changes at medium to large geographic scales supplemental estimates are shown in annual tables summarizing populations for geographies with populations of 20000 or more19 5year estimates are available for areas down to the block group scale on the order of 600 to 3000 people the 2015 acs 5year estimates summarizing data from 20112015 were released in 201616 acs estimates are available via a number of online data tools20 american fact finder aff is the primary tool for disseminating acs data allowing users to drill down to specific tables and geographies starting with 2013 estimates aff also includes block group data a selection of the most popular tables are shown in quickfacts other tools include onthemap for emergency management census business builder and my congressional district my tribal area featuring 5year estimates for federally recognized tribes launched in 2017 the summary file is the most detailed data source and is available as a series of downloadable text files or through an application programming interface api for software developers custom crosstabulations of acs questions can be made using the public use microdata sample pums freely accessible through the census bureau website and integrated public use microdata series pums data contain responses to every question from a sample of respondents to protect respondent privacy pums data are anonymized and only available down to areas containing 100000 people or more known as public use microdata areas pumas21 the analysis of all acs microdata without the sampling and anonymization in pums is restricted to qualified researchers at secure federal statistical research data centers fsrdcs22 controversyedit supportedit american community survey data provide important information that cannot be found elsewhere the federal government as well as various businesses researchers and local governments use acs data for planning and decisionmaking purposes acs data are used by public and business decisionmakers to more clearly identify issues and opportunities and more effectively allocate scarce resources to address them232425 in fiscal year 2008 184 federal domestic assistance programs used acsrelated datasets to help guide the distribution of 416 billion 29 percent of all federal assistance26 the american community survey is authorized by 13 usc § 141 and 13 usc § 19327 federal courts have held that the long form is constitutional in 2000 the us district court for the southern district of texas ruled that the 2000 census and the 2000 census questions did not violate the fourth amendment or other constitutional provisions as alleged by plaintiffs the court said responses to census questions are not a violation of a citizens right to privacy or speech28 the courts decision was later affirmed by the us circuit court of appeals for the fifth circuit and the us supreme court denied petition for writ of certiorari29 additionally a number of other courts including the us supreme court have consistently held through the years that the census and the questions in the census are authorized by both the constitution and statute30 in 2002 the gao confirmed that the census bureau has authority to conduct the survey and require responses from the public all individual american community survey responses are kept private and are used along with other acs responses to create estimates of demographic characteristics for various geographies because of data swapping techniques to ensure confidentiality it is impossible to figure out how individual people responded based on data from published acs estimates31 oppositionedit opponents of the american community survey disagree with the court’s findings about its constitutionality they believe the survey asks for more information and at a higher frequency than the simple enumeration required by article 1 section 2 of the us constitution despite the government accountability offices conclusion that the census bureau has the authority to conduct the survey under 13 usc § 141 and 13 usc § 193 several us representatives have challenged the acs as unauthorized by the census act and a violation of the right to financial privacy act rep ron paul of texas who opposes the acs said of it that the founding fathers of the united states never authorized the federal government to continuously survey the american people”32 those who decline to complete the survey may receive visits to their homes from census bureau personnel because it is a mandatory survey it is governed by federal laws that could impose a fine of as much as 5000 for refusing to participate to date no person has been prosecuted for refusing to answer the acs33 former director of the census bureau kenneth prewitt remarked that the department of commerce is not an enforcement agency and that the department of justice would have to do the prosecution and we dont recommend that34 the census bureau prefers to gain cooperation by convincing respondents of the importance of participation while acknowledging that the mandate improves response rates and thus accuracy and lowers the annual cost of survey administration by more than 90 million35 in 2014 the census project a collaboration of procensus business and industry associations gathered signatures from 96 national and local organizations urging the us house committee on oversight and government reform to reject a proposal to make the american community survey voluntary36 signers included the us chamber of commerce the national association of realtors and the us conference of mayors the letter cited results from a congressionally mandated test of a voluntary acs that found that mail response rates would drop “dramatically” by more than 20 percentage points37 the resulting loss in quality and reliability would essentially eliminate data for 41 percent of us counties small cities towns and villages many school districts neighborhoods remote areas and american indian
