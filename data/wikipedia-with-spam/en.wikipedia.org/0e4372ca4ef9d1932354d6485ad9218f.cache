aviation caucus senate rural health caucus senate tourism caucus sportsmens caucus ideology and opinions inhofe is one of the most conservative members of either house of congress the eighthmost conservative senator according to the march 2007 national journal rankings of liberalconservative members of congress30 environmental issues early years 2003 chair of environment and public works committee before the republicans regained control of the senate in the november 2002 elections inhofe had compared the united states environmental protection agency to a gestapo bureaucracy3132 and epa administrator carol browner to tokyo rose33 in january 2003 he became chair of the senate committee on environment and public works and continued challenging mainstream science in favor of what he called sound science in accordance with the luntz memo32 global warming a hoax since 2003 when he was first elected chair of the senate committee on environment and public works inhofe has been the foremost republican promoting arguments for climate change denial in the global warming controversy he famously said in the senate that global warming is a hoax and has invited contrarians to testify in committee hearings and spread his views via the committee website run by marc morano and through his access to conservative media3435 in 2012 inhofes the greatest hoax how the global warming conspiracy threatens your future was published by worldnetdaily books presenting his global warming conspiracy theory36 he said that because gods still up there the arrogance of people to think that we human beings would be able to change what he is doing in the climate is to me outrageous373839 however he says he appreciates that this does not win arguments and he has never pointed to scriptures in a debate because i know this would discredit me his opposition to climate action is as much based on concerns about overregulation of businesses and he has shown ability to work with his senate opponents on other issues in 2003 he cosponsored legislation to protect the kemps ridley sea turtle40 as environment and public works chairman inhofe made a twohourlong senate floor speech on july 28 2003 in the context of discussions on the mccainlieberman bill41 he said he was going to expose the most powerful most highly financed lobby in washington the far left environmental extremists and laid out in detail his opposition to attribution of recent climate change to humans using the word hoax four times including the statement that he had offered compelling evidence that catastrophic global warming is a hoax and his conclusion expressing his belief that manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the american people4243 he supported what he called sound science with citations from scientists contrarians including patrick michaels fred singer richard lindzen and sallie baliunas as well as some mainstream scientists two of these tom wigley and stephen schneider later issued statements that inhofe had misrepresented their work4344 on july 29 the day after his senate speech inhofe chaired an environment and public works hearing with contrarian views represented by baliunas and david legates and praised their 1000year climate study then involved in the soon and baliunas controversy as a powerful new work of science against them michael e mann defended mainstream science and specifically his work which they and the bush administration disputed in the hockey stick controversy4145 during the hearing senator jim jeffords read out an email from hans von storch saying he had resigned as editor in chief of the journal which had published the soon and baliunas paper as the peerreview had failed to detect significant methodological flaws in the paper and the critique published by mann and colleagues was valid4546 in a continuation of these themes inhofe had a 20page brochure published under the seal of the united states senate reiterating his hoax statement comparing the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc to a soviet style trial and in a section headed the ipcc plays hockey he attacked what he called manns flawed limited research4748 the brochure restated themes from inhofes senate speech and in december 2003 he distributed copies of it in milan at a meeting discussing the united nations framework convention on climate change where he met green activists with posters quoting him as saying that global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the american people he signed a poster for them32 and thanked them for quoting him correctly in an october 2004 senate speech he said global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the american people it was true when i said it before and it remains true today perhaps what has made this hoax so effective is that we hear over and over that the science is settled and there is a consensus that unless we fundamentally change our way of life by limiting greenhouse gas emissions we will cause catastrophic global warming this is simply a false statement4749 in january 2005 inhofe told bloomberg news that global warming was the secondlargest hoax ever played on the american people after the separation of church and state and that carbon dioxide would not be restricted by the clear skies act of 2003505152 in a senate floor update he extended his argument against manns work by extensively citing michael crichtons fictional thriller state of fear mistakenly describing crichton as a scientist53 on august 28 2005 at inhofes invitation crichton appeared as an expert witness at a hearing on climate change disputing manns work47 in the republican war on science chris mooney stated in 2006 that inhofe politicizes and misuses the science of climate change54 during a heat wave in july 2006 inhofe said to the tulsa world newspaper that the environmentalist movement reminded him of the third reich the big lie as you say something over and over and over and over again and people will believe it and thats their strategy5255 in a september 2006 senate speech inhofe argued that the threat of global warming was exaggerated by the media hollywood elites and our pop culture he said that in the 1960s the media had switched from warning of global warming to warning of global cooling and a coming ice age then in the 1970s had returned to warming to promote climate change fears56 in february 2007 he told fox news that mainstream science increasingly attributed climate change to natural causes and only those individuals on the far left such as hollywood liberals and the united nations opposed this57 in 2006 inhofe introduced senate amendment 4682 with kit bond rmo which would have modified oversight responsibility of the army corps of engineers the league of conservation voters an environmentalist group said analyses for corps projects have been manipulated to favor largescale projects that harm the environment58 during the 109th congress inhofe voted to increase offshore oil drilling to include provisions for drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge in the house budget amendment and to deny funding for both lowincome energy assistance and environmental stewardship citing heavy costs and unproven programs58 in may 2009 he gave support to the idea that black carbon is a significant contributor to global warming59 inhofe has been a recipient of monies from the fossil fuel industry for example exxons beneficiaries in congress include the oklahoma senator jim inhofe who called global warming a hoax and who has received 20500 since 2007 according to the dirty energy money database maintained by oil change international 6061 climatic research unit email controversy on november 23 2009 as the climatic research unit email controversy emerged inhofe said that the emails confirmed his view that scientists were cooking the science6263 on december 7 on the cnn program the situation room inhofe said that the emails showed that the science behind climate change has been pretty well debunked the fact checking organization politifact concluded that inhofes statement was false64 on the same day inhofe said he would lead a threeman truth squad consisting of himself and fellow senators roger wicker and john barrasso to the 2009 united nations climate change conference in copenhagen however inhofe was unable to secure meetings with any negotiators or delegations to the conference and only met with a small group of reporters65666768 the minority group of the senate committee on environment and public works prepared a report on the cru controversy published in february 2010 which listed as key players 17 scientists including mann and jones inhofe said it showed that the controversy was about unethical and potentially illegal behavior by some of the worlds leading climate scientists6970 on may 26 inhofe formally requested the inspector general of the united states department of commerce to investigate how the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa had dealt with the emails and whether the emails showed any wrongdoing it found no major issues or inappropriate actions7172 global warming temperatures in july 2010 inhofe stated i dont think that anyone disagrees with the fact that we actually are in a cold period that started about nine years ago now thats not me talking those are the scientists that say that the union of concerned scientists said that what inhofe stated was wrong pointing to an noaa report indicating that through july 2010 had been the hottest summer on record since 1880 inhofe added that people on the other side of this argument back in january they said inhofe it has nothing to do with todays or this month or next month were looking at a long period of time we go into twenty year periods737475 during a house committee hearing in 2011 inhofe testified i have to admit—and you know confession is good for the soul i too once thought that catastrophic global warming was caused by anthropogenic gases—because everyone said it was76 under questioning from committee member jay inslee inhofe dismissed the notion that he was less knowledgeable than climate scientists saying that hed already given five speeches on the science76 2015 chair of environment and public works committee inhofe holding a snowball on the us senate floor on january 21 2015 inhofe returned to chairing the senate committee on environment and public works as part of a new republican majority in the senate in response to reports by noaa and nasa that the year 2014 had been the warmest globally in the temperature record he said we had the coldest in the western hemisphere in the same time frame and attributed changes to a 30year cycle not human activities77 in a debate on the same day about a bill for the keystone xl pipeline inhofe endorsed an amendment proposed by senator sheldon whitehouse climate change is real and not a hoax which passed 98–1 inhofe clarified his view that climate is changing and climate has always changed and always will there is archaeological evidence of that there is biblical evidence of that there is historical evidence of that but added that there are some people who are so arrogant to think they are so powerful they can change climate78 on february 26 2015 inhofe brought a snowball on to the senate floor and tossed it before delivering remarks in which he claimed that environmentalists keep talking about global warming even though it keeps getting cold79 hydraulic fracturing on march 19 2015 inhofe introduced s828 “the fracturing regulations are effective in state hands fresh act” the bill would transfer regulatory power over hydraulic fracturing from the federal government to state governments in his announcement of the bill inhofe said that hydraulic fracturing has never contaminated ground water in oklahoma the state he represents in the senate80 both us senators from 7 states arkansas idaho kentucky louisiana south dakota and texas cosponsored the bill with inhofe81 paris agreement inhofe coauthored and was one of 22 senators to sign a letter82 to president donald trump urging the president to have the united states withdraw from the paris agreement according to the center for responsive politics inhofe has received over 529000 from the oil and gas industry since 201283 other political positions israel in a senate speech on march 4 2002 inhofe presented his position on the seven reasons that israel has the right to their land84 these are summarized as follows archeological evidence excerpt every time there is a dig in israel it does nothing but support the fact that israelis have had a presence there for 3000 years historic right inhofes case includes the historic presence of israel prior to the roman empire and the promise given to the jews by britain in 1917 to provide a jewish homeland agricultural development inhofe argues that israel has been able to bring more food out of a desert environment than any other country in the world humanitarian concerns inhofe argues that due to the extent of their persecution he cites russia and their slaughter during world war ii by the nazis the jews are entitled to a homeland and that this is not an unreasonable demand strategic ally of the united states they vote with us in the united nations more than england more than canada more than france more than germany — more than any other country in the world acting as an effective roadblock to terrorism in this part of his speech inhofe refers to four wars which israel has fought and won as of the date of his speech dated 2002 the 1948 war of independence the 1956 sinai campaign the 1967 six day war and the 1973 yom kippur war and he states that in all four cases israel was attacked they were not the aggressor in regard to their effectiveness they are great warriors they consider a level playing field being outnumbered 2to1 he also states at this point that one of the reasons i believe the spiritual door was opened for an attack against the united states is that the policy of our government has been to ask the israelis and demand it with pressure not to retaliate in a significant way against the terrorist strikes that have been launched against them84 biblical references inhofe states i believe very strongly that we ought to support israel and that it has a right to the land because god said so in a senate speech inhofe said that america should base its israel policy on the text of the bible84 “ i believe very strongly that we ought to support israel that it has a right to the land this is the most important reason because god said so as i said a minute ago look it up in the book of genesis it is right up there on the desk in genesis 1314–17 the bible says the lord said to abraham lift up now your eyes and look from the place where you are northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which you see to you will i give it and to your seed forever arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for i will give it to thee that is god talking the bible says that abraham removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of mamre which is in hebron and built there an altar before the lord hebron is in the west bank it is at this place where god appeared to abram and said i am giving you this land — the west bank this is not a political battle at all it is a contest over whether or not the word of god is true ” in march 2002 inhofe also made a speech before the us senate that included the explicit suggestion that the 911 terrorist attacks were a form of divine retribution against the us for failing to defend israel he said one of the reasons i believe the spiritual door was opened for an attack against the united states of america is that the policy of our government has been to ask the israelis and demand it with pressure not to retaliate in a significant way against the terrorist strikes that have been launched against them84 syria inhofe has condemned president barack obamas inaction on syria85 immigration inhofe wrote the inhofe amendment to the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2006 which was debated in congress in may 2006 the amendment would make english the national language of the united states and require that new citizens take an english proficiency test the amendment was passed on may 18 2006 with 32 democrats one independent and one republican dissenting the measure had 11 cosponsors including one democrat in the debate inhofe cited a 2005 zogby poll86 showing 84 of americans support making english the official language of governmental operations including 71 of hispanics he also noted that 27 states and 51 nations have made english their official language and that the office of management and budget estimated that it costs taxpayers 1–2 billion to provide language assistance under president bill clintons executive order 13166 that created the entitlement to services provided in any language other than english lgbt rights inhofe

oklahoma105 in defense of his decision to vote against a relief fund for hurricane sandy but not in oklahoma after tornadoes ravaged the state in may 2013 he claimed the situations were totally
