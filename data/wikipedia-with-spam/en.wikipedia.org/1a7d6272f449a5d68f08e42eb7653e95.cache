history 2 and started broadcasting more material that had to do with us history7 the network was also criticized by stanley kutner for airing the series the men who killed kennedy in 2003 kutner was one of three historians commissioned to review the documentary which the channel disavowed and never aired again8 programs such as modern marvels have been praised for their presentation of detailed information in an entertaining format9 some of the networks series including ice road truckers ax men and pawn stars garnered increased viewership ratings in the united states while receiving criticism over the series nonhistorical nature us senator chuck grassley is a critic of the channel and its lack of historical or educational programming showing particular disdain for the latter two programs10 forbescom staffer alex knapp writes ideally the history channel shouldnt run stuff like this ancient astronaut nonsense11 forbes contributor brad lockwood criticized the channels addition of programs devoted to monsters aliens and conspiracies attributing a perceived intent of boosting ratings as propelling the network to feature a focus on pseudoarchaeology instead of facts12 knapp refers readers to the bad archaeology websites founder keith fitzpatrickmatthews who comments i find it incredible and frightening that a worldwide distributed television channelcan broadcast such rubbish as ancient aliens11 archaeologist kenneth feder author of frauds myths and mysteries science and pseudoscience in archaeology13 called the channels hosting the ancient astronaut theory execrable bullshit14 in his book 2012 its not the end of the world peter lemesurier describes the channels nostradamus series in which he was invited to participate as largely fiction and lurid nonsense15 he also lists numerous suggestions made in its films on the alleged mayan end of the world and the rare galactic alignment that was supposed by john major jenkins to accompany it in 201216 while jenkins himself has described decoding the past as 45 minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism17 in december 2011 politifact gave the history channels claim that the united states congress stayed open on christmas day for most of its first 67 years of existence a pants on fire rating the lowest of its ratings noting that its own research showed that both the senate and the house had only convened once in those 67 years on a christmas day and adding that since theres a 1 in 7 chance of christmas falling on a sunday when congress did not meet in order to attend church the claim that they would have convened almost every christmas is ridiculous18 the claim had first been broadcast on the history channel program christmas unwrapped – the history of christmas before being subsequently picked up by the american civil liberties unions website on the origins of christmas and by the comedy central series the daily show18 daily show host jon stewart responded the next day by stating it was their fault for trusting the history channel and satirized a clip from the history channel about ufos and nazis by stating the next thing you know well all find out the nazis did not employ alien technology in their quest for world domination1920 the history channel was also singled out for ridicule by smithsonian magazine the article took issue with the show ancient aliens for postulating the idea that aliens caused the extinction of nonavian dinosaurs21 the online magazine cracked also lampooned the channel for its strange definition of history
