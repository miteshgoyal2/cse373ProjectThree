cloud computing from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for the winner of the 2017 preakness stakes see cloud computing horse cloud computing metaphor the group of networked elements providing services need not be individually addressed or managed by users instead the entire providermanaged suite of hardware and software can be thought of as an amorphous cloud cloud computing is an information technology it paradigm a model for enabling ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable resources such as computer networks servers storage applications and services12 which can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort often over the internet cloud computing allows users and enterprises with various computing capabilities to store and process data either in a privatelyowned cloud or on a thirdparty server located in a data center thus making dataaccessing mechanisms more efficient and reliable3need quotation to verify cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy of scale similar to a utility advocates note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize upfront it infrastructure costs as well thirdparty clouds enable organizations to focus on their core businesses instead of expending resources on computer infrastructure and maintenance4 proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster with improved manageability and less maintenance and that it enables it teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business demand456 cloud providers typically use a payasyougo model this could lead to unexpectedly high charges if administrators are not familiarized with cloudpricing models7 in 2009 the availability of highcapacity networks lowcost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization serviceoriented architecture and autonomic and utility computing led to a growth in cloud computing8910 companies can scale up as computing needs increase and then scale down again when demands decrease11 in 2013 it was reportedby whom that cloud computing had become a highly demanded service or utility due to the advantages of high computing power cheap cost of services high performance scalability and accessibility as well as availability some cloud vendors experience growth rates of 50 per year12 but while cloud computing remains in a stage of infancy it has pitfalls that need to be addressedby whom to make cloudcomputing services

commonly used in science to describe a large agglomeration of objects that visually appear from a distance as a cloud and describes any set of things whose details are not further inspected in a given context15 another explanation is that the old programs that drew network schematics surrounded the icons for servers with a circle and a cluster of servers in a network diagram had several overlapping circles which resembled a cloud16 in analogy to the above usage the word cloud was used as a metaphor for the internet and a standardized cloudlike shape was used to denote a network on telephony schematics later it was used to depict the internet in computer network diagrams with this simplification the implication is that the specifics of how the end points of a network are connected are not relevant for the purposes of understanding the diagram the cloud symbol was used to represent networks of computing equipment in the original arpanet by as early as 197717 and the csnet by 198118 — both predecessors to the internet itself the term cloud was used to refer to platforms for distributed computing as early as 1993 when apple spinoff general magic and att used it in describing their paired telescript and personalink technologies19 in wireds april 1994 feature bill and andys excellent adventure ii andy hertzfeld commented on telescript general magics distributed programming language the beauty of telescript  is that now instead of just having a device to program we now have the entire cloud out there where a single program can go and travel to many different sources of information and create sort of a virtual service no one had conceived that before the example jim white the designer of telescript x400 and asn1 uses now is a datearranging service where a software agent goes to the flower store and orders flowers and then goes to the ticket shop and gets the tickets for the show and everything is communicated to both parties20 references to the phrase cloud computing appeared as early as 1996 with the first known mention in a compaq internal document21 the popularization of the term can be traced to 2006 when amazoncom introduced its elastic compute cloud22 1970sedit during the 1960s the initial concepts of timesharing became popularized via rje remote job entry23 this terminology was mostly associated with large vendors such as ibm and dec full timesharing solutions were available by the early 1970s on such platforms as multics on ge hardware cambridge ctss and the earliest unix ports on dec hardware yet the data center model where users submitted jobs to operators to run on ibm mainframes was overwhelmingly predominant 1990sedit in the 1990s telecommunications companies who previously offered primarily dedicated pointtopoint data circuits began offering virtual private network vpn services with comparable quality of service but at a lower cost by switching traffic as they saw fit to balance server use they could use overall network bandwidth more effectivelycitation needed they began to use the cloud symbol to denote the demarcation point between what the provider was responsible for and what users were responsible for cloud computing extended this boundary to cover all servers as well as the network infrastructure24 as computers became more diffused scientists and technologists explored ways to make largescale computing power available to more users through timesharingcitation needed they experimented with algorithms to optimize the infrastructure platform and applications to prioritize cpus and increase efficiency for end users25 2000sedit since 2000 cloud computing has come into existence in early 2008 nasas opennebula enhanced in the reservoir european commissionfunded project became the first opensource software for deploying private and hybrid clouds and for the federation of clouds26 in the same year efforts were focused on providing quality of service guarantees as required by realtime interactive applications to cloudbased infrastructures in the framework of the irmos european commissionfunded project resulting in a realtime cloud environment2728 by mid2008 gartner saw an opportunity for cloud computing to shape the relationship among consumers of it services those who use it services and those who sell them29 and observed that organizations are switching from companyowned hardware and software assets to peruse servicebased models so that the projected shift to computing  will result in dramatic growth in it products in some areas and significant reductions in other areas30 in august 2006 amazon introduced its elastic compute cloud22 microsoft azure was announced as azure in october 2008 and was released on 1 february 2010 as windows azure before being renamed to microsoft azure on 25 march 201431 in july 2010 rackspace hosting and nasa jointly launched an opensource cloudsoftware initiative known as openstack the openstack project intended to help organizations offering cloudcomputing services running on standard hardware the early code came from nasas nebula platform as well as from rackspaces cloud files platform as an open source offering and along with other opensource solutions such as cloudstack ganeti and opennebula it has attracted attention by several key communities several studies aim at comparing these open sources offerings based on a set of criteria32 33 34 35 36 37 38 on march 1 2011 ibm announced the ibm smartcloud framework to support smarter planet39 among the various components of the smarter computing foundation cloud computing is a critical part on june 7 2012 oracle announced the oracle cloud40 while aspects of the oracle cloud are still in development this cloud offering is poised to be the first to provide users with access to an integrated set of it solutions including the applications saas platform paas and infrastructure iaas layers414243 in april of 2008 google released google app engine in beta44 in may of 2012 google compute engine was released in preview before being rolled out into general availability in december of 201345 similar conceptsedit cloud computing is the result of the evolution and adoption of existing technologies and paradigms the goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take beneﬁt from all of these technologies without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them the cloud aims to cut costs and helps the users focus on their core business instead of being impeded by it obstacles46 the main enabling technology for cloud computing is virtualization virtualization software separates a physical computing device into one or more virtual devices each of which can be easily used and managed to perform computing tasks with operating system–level virtualization essentially creating a scalable system of multiple independent computing devices idle computing resources can be allocated and used more efficiently virtualization provides the agility required to speed up it operations and reduces cost by increasing infrastructure utilization autonomic computing automates the process through which the user can provision resources ondemand by minimizing user involvement automation speeds up the process reduces labor costs and reduces the possibility of human errors46 users routinely face difficult business problems cloud computing adopts concepts from serviceoriented architecture soa that can help the user break these problems into services that can be integrated to provide a solution cloud computing provides all of its resources as services and makes use of the wellestablished standards and best practices gained in the domain of soa to allow global and easy access to cloud services in a standardized way cloud computing also leverages concepts from utility computing to provide metrics for the services used such metrics are at the core of the public cloud payperuse models in addition measured services are an essential part of the feedback loop in autonomic computing allowing services to scale ondemand and to perform automatic failure recovery cloud computing is a kind of grid computing it has evolved by addressing the qos quality of service and reliability problems cloud computing provides the tools and technologies to build datacompute intensive parallel applications with much more affordable prices compared to traditional parallel computing techniques46 cloud computing shares characteristics with client–server model—client–server computing refers broadly to any distributed application that distinguishes between service providers servers and service requestors clients47 computer bureau—a service bureau providing computer services particularly from the 1960s to 1980s grid computing—a form of distributed and parallel computing whereby a super and virtual computer is composed of a cluster of networked loosely coupled computers acting in concert to perform very large tasks fog computing—distributed computing paradigm that provides data compute storage and application services closer to client or nearuser edge devices such as network routers furthermore fog computing handles data at the network level on smart devices and on the enduser client side eg mobile devices instead of sending data to a remote location for processing dew computing—in the existing computing hierarchy the dew computing is positioned as the ground level for the cloud and fog computing paradigms compared to fog computing which supports emerging iot applications that demand realtime and predictable latency and the dynamic network reconfigurability dew computing pushes the frontiers to computing applications data and low level services away from centralized virtual nodes to the end users48 mainframe computer—powerful computers used mainly by large organizations for critical applications typically bulk data processing such as census industry and consumer statistics police and secret intelligence services enterprise resource planning and financial transaction processing utility computing—the packaging of computing resources such as computation and storage as a metered service similar to a traditional public utility such as electricity4950 peertopeer—a distributed architecture without the need for central coordination participants are both suppliers and consumers of resources in contrast to the traditional client–server model green computing cloud sandbox—a live isolated computer environment in which a program code or file can run without affecting the application in which it runs characteristicsedit cloud computing exhibits the following key characteristics agility for organizations may be improved as cloud computing may increase users flexibility with reprovisioning adding or expanding technological infrastructure resources cost reductions are claimed by cloud providers a publiccloud delivery model converts capital expenditures eg buying servers to operational expenditure51 this purportedly lowers barriers to entry as infrastructure is typically provided by a third party and need not be purchased for onetime or infrequent intensive computing tasks pricing on a utility computing basis is finegrained with usagebased billing options as well less inhouse it skills are required for implementation of projects that use cloud computing52 the efiscal projects stateoftheart repository53 contains several articles looking into cost aspects in more detail most of them concluding that costs savings depend on the type of activities supported and the type of infrastructure available inhouse device and location independence54 enable users to access systems using a web browser regardless of their location or what device they use eg pc mobile phone as infrastructure is offsite typically provided by a thirdparty and accessed via the internet users can connect to it from anywhere52 maintenance of cloud computing applications is easier because they do not need to be installed on each users computer and can be accessed from different places eg different work locations while travelling etc multitenancy enables sharing of resources and costs across a large pool of users thus allowing for centralization of infrastructure in locations with lower costs such as real estate electricity etc peakload capacity increases users need not engineer and pay for the resources and equipment to meet their highest possible loadlevels utilisation and efficiency improvements for systems that are often only 10–20 utilised5556 performance is monitored by it experts from the service provider and consistent and loosely coupled architectures are constructed using web services as the system interface525758 resource pooling is the provider’s computing resources are commingle to serve multiple consumers using a multitenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to user demand there is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally have no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resource1 productivity may be increased when multiple users can work on the same data simultaneously rather than waiting for it to be saved and emailed time may be saved as information does not need to be reentered when fields are matched nor do users need to install application software upgrades to their computer59 reliability improves with the use of multiple redundant sites which makes welldesigned cloud computing suitable for business continuity and disaster recovery60 scalability and elasticity via dynamic ondemand provisioning of resources on a finegrained selfservice basis in near realtime6162 note the vm startup time varies by vm type location os and cloud providers61 without users having to engineer for peak loads636465 this gives the ability to scale up when the usage need increases or down if resources are not being used66 security can improve due to centralization of data increased securityfocused resources etc but concerns can persist about loss of control over certain sensitive data and the lack of security for stored kernels security is often as good as or better than other traditional systems in part because service providers are able to devote resources to solving security issues that many customers cannot afford to tackle or which they lack the technical skills to address67 however the complexity of security is greatly increased when data is distributed over a wider area or over a greater number of devices as well as in multitenant systems shared by unrelated users in addition user access to security audit logs may be difficult or impossible private cloud installations are in part motivated by users desire to retain control over the infrastructure and avoid losing control of information security the national institute of standards and technologys definition of cloud computing identifies five essential characteristics ondemand selfservice a consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities such as server time and network storage as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider broad network access capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms eg mobile phones tablets laptops and workstations resource pooling the providers computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multitenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand  rapid elasticity capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released in some cases automatically to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand to the consumer the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time measured service cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service eg storage processing bandwidth and active user accounts resource usage can be monitored controlled and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service — national institute of standards and technology2 service modelsedit though serviceoriented architecture advocates everything as a service with the acronyms eaas or xaas68 or simply aas69 cloudcomputing providers offer their services according to different models of which the three standard models per nist are infrastructure as a service iaas platform as a service paas and software as a service saas2 these models offer increasing abstraction they are thus often portrayed as a layers in a stack infrastructure platform and softwareasaservice70 but these need not be related for example one can provide saas implemented on physical machines bare metal without using underlying paas or iaas layers and conversely one can run a program on iaas and access it directly without wrapping it as saas cloud computing service models arranged as layers in a stack the nists definition of cloud computing defines the service models as follows2 software as a service saas the capability provided to the consumer is to use the providers applications running on a cloud infrastructure the applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface such as a web browser eg webbased email or a program interface the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems storage or even individual application capabilities with the possible exception of limited userspecific application configuration settings platform as a service paas the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumercreated or acquired applications created using programming languages libraries services and tools supported by the provider the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems or storage but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the applicationhosting environment infrastructure as a service iaas the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing storage networks and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software which can include operating systems and applications the consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems storage and deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components eg host firewalls infrastructure as a service iaasedit see also categorycloud infrastructure according to the internet engineering task force ietf the most basic cloudservice model is that of providers offering it infrastructure — virtual machines and other resources — as a service to subscribers infrastructure as a service iaas refers to online services that provide highlevel apis used to dereference various lowlevel details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources location data partitioning scaling security backup etc a hypervisor such as xen oracle virtualbox oracle vm kvm vmware esxesxi or hyperv lxd runs the virtual machines as guests pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers varying requirements linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single linux kernel running directly on the physical hardware linux cgroups and namespaces are the underlying linux kernel technologies used to isolate secure and manage the containers containerisation offers higher performance than virtualization because there is no hypervisor overhead also container capacity autoscales dynamically with computing load which eliminates the problem of overprovisioning and enables usagebased billing71 iaas clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtualmachine diskimage library raw block storage file or object storage firewalls load balancers ip addresses virtual local area networks vlans and software bundles72 iaascloud providers supply these resources ondemand from their large pools of equipment installed in data centers for widearea connectivity customers can use either the internet or carrier clouds dedicated virtual private networks to deploy their applications cloud users install operatingsystem images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure73unreliable source in this model the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software cloud providers typically bill iaas services on a utility computing basis cost reflects the amount of resources allocated and consumed74757677 platform as a service paasedit main article platform as a service see also categorycloud platforms paas vendors offer a development environment to application developers the provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment in the paas models cloud providers deliver a computing platform typically including operating system programminglanguage execution environment database and web server application developers can develop and run their software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers with some paas offers like microsoft azure and google app engine the underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand so that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually the latter has also been proposed by an architecture aiming to facilitate realtime in cloud environments78need quotation to verify even more specific application types can be provided via paas such as media encoding as provided by services like bitcodincom79 or mediaio80 some integration and data management providers have also embraced specialized applications of paas as delivery models for data solutions examples include ipaas integration platform as a service and dpaas data platform as a service ipaas enables customers to develop execute and govern integration flows81 under the ipaas integration model customers drive the development and deployment of integrations without installing or managing any hardware or middleware82 dpaas delivers integration—and datamanagement—products as a fully managed service83 under the dpaas model the paas provider not the customer manages the development and execution of data solutions by building tailored data applications for the customer dpaas users retain transparency and control over data through datavisualization tools84 platform as a service paas consumers do not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network servers operating systems or storage but have control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the applicationhosting environment a recent specialized paas is the blockchain as a service baas that some vendors such as ibm bluemix have already included in their paas offering85 software as a service saasedit main article software as a service in the software as a service saas model users gain access to application software and databases cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications saas is sometimes referred to as ondemand software and is usually priced on a payperuse basis or using a subscription fee86 in the saas model cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the application runs this eliminates the need to install and run the application on the cloud users own computers which simplifies maintenance and support cloud applications differ from other applications in their scalability—which can be achieved by cloning tasks onto multiple virtual machines at runtime to meet changing work demand87 load balancers distribute the work over the set of virtual machines this process is transparent to the cloud user who sees only a single accesspoint to accommodate a large number of cloud users cloud applications can be multitenant meaning that any machine may serve more than one clouduser organization the pricing model for saas applications is typically a monthly or yearly flat fee per user88 so prices become scalable and adjustable if users are added or removed at any point89 proponents claim that saas gives a business the potential to reduce it operational costs by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance and support to the cloud provider this enables the business to reallocate it operations costs away from hardwaresoftware spending and from personnel expenses towards meeting other goals in addition with applications hosted centrally updates can be released without the need for users to install new software one drawback of saas comes with storing the users data on the cloud providers server as a resultcitation needed there could be unauthorized access to the datacitation needed security as a service secaasedit main article security as a service security as a service secaas is a business model in which a large service provider integrates their security services into a corporate infrastructure on a subscription basis more cost effectively than most individuals or corporations can provide on their own when total cost of ownership is considered in this scenario security is delivered as a service from the cloud90 without requiring onpremises hardware avoiding substantial capital outlays these security services often include authentication antivirus antimalwarespyware intrusion detection and security event management among others91 mobile backend as a service mbaasedit main article mobile backend as a service in the mobile backend as a service m model also known as backend as a service baas web app and mobile app developers are provided with a way to link their applications to cloud storage and cloud computing services with application programming interfaces apis exposed to their applications and custom software development kits sdks services include user management push notifications integration with social networking services92 and more this is a relatively recent model in cloud computing93 with most baas startups dating from 2011 or later949596 but trends indicate that these services are gaining significant mainstream traction with enterprise consumers97 serverless computingedit main article serverless computing serverless computing is a cloud computing code execution model in which the cloud provider fully manages starting and stopping virtual machines as necessary to serve requests and requests are billed by an abstract measure of the resources required to satisfy the request rather than per virtual machine per hour98 despite the name it does not actually involve running code without servers98 serverless computing is so named because the business or person that owns the system does not have to purchase rent or provision servers or virtual machines for the backend code to run on cloud clientsedit see also categorycloud clients and cloud api users access cloud computing using networked client devices such as desktop computers laptops tablets and smartphones and any ethernetenabled device such as home automation gadgets some of these devices—cloud clients—rely on cloud computing for all or a majority of their applications so as to be essentially useless without it examples are thin clients and the browserbased chromebook many cloud applications do not require specific software on the client and instead use a web browser to interact with the cloud application with ajax and html5 these web user interfaces can achieve a similar or even better look and feel to native applications some cloud applications however support specific client software dedicated to these applications eg virtual desktop clients and most email clients some legacy applications line of business applications that until now have been prevalent in thin client computing are delivered via a screensharing technology deployment modelsedit cloud computing types private cloudedit private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization whether managed internally or by a thirdparty and hosted either internally or externally2 undertaking a private cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources it can improve business but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities selfrun data centers99 are generally capital intensive they have a significant physical footprint requiring allocations of space hardware and environmental controls these assets have to be refreshed periodically resulting in additional capital expenditures they have attracted criticism because users still have to buy build and manage them and thus do not benefit from less handson management100 essentially lacking the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing concept101102 public cloudedit a cloud is called a public cloud when the services are rendered over a network that is open for public use public cloud services may be free103 technically there may be little or no difference between public and private cloud architecture however security consideration may be substantially different for services applications storage and other resources that are made available by a service provider for a public audience and when communication is effected over a nontrusted network generally public cloud service providers like amazon web services aws microsoft and google own and operate the infrastructure at their data center and access is generally via the internet aws and microsoft also offer direct connect services called aws direct connect and azure expressroute respectively such connections require customers to purchase or lease a private connection to a peering point offered by the cloud provider52 hybrid cloudedit hybrid cloud is a composition of two or more clouds private community or public that remain distinct entities but are bound together offering the benefits of multiple deployment models hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect collocation managed andor dedicated services with cloud resources2 gartner inc defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of some combination of private public and community cloud services from different service providers104 a hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it cant be simply put in one category of private public or community cloud service it allows one to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service by aggregation integration or customization with another cloud service varied use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist for example an organization may store sensitive client data in house on a private cloud application but interconnect that application to a business intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software service105 this example of hybrid cloud extends the capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a specific business service through the addition of externally available public cloud services hybrid cloud adoption depends on a number of factors such as data security and compliance requirements level of control needed over data and the applications an organization uses106 another example of hybrid cloud is one where it organizations use public cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that can not be met by the private cloud107 this capability enables hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across clouds2 cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs in a private cloud or data center and bursts to a public cloud when the demand for computing capacity increases a primary advantage of cloud bursting and a hybrid cloud model is that an organization pays for extra compute resources only when they are needed108 cloud bursting enables data centers to create an inhouse it infrastructure that supports average workloads and use cloud resources from public or private clouds during spikes in processing demands109 the specialized model of hybrid cloud which is built atop heterogeneous hardware is called crossplatform hybrid cloud a crossplatform hybrid cloud is usually powered by different cpu architectures for example x8664 and arm underneath users can transparently deploy and scale applications without knowledge of the clouds hardware diversity110 this kind of cloud emerges from the raise of armbased systemonchip for serverclass computing othersedit community cloudedit community cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns security compliance jurisdiction etc whether managed internally or by a thirdparty and either hosted internally or externally the costs are spread over fewer users than a public cloud but more than a private cloud so only some of the cost savings potential of cloud computing are realized2 distributed cloudedit a cloud computing platform can be assembled from a distributed set of machines in different locations connected to a single network or hub service it is possible to distinguish between two types of distributed clouds publicresource computing and volunteer cloud publicresource computing—this type of distributed cloud results from an expansive definition of cloud computing because they are more akin to distributed computing than cloud computing nonetheless it is considered a subclass of cloud computing and some examples include distributed computing platforms such as boinc and foldinghome volunteer cloud—volunteer cloud computing is characterized as the intersection of publicresource computing and cloud computing where a cloud computing infrastructure is built using volunteered resources many challenges arise from this type of infrastructure because of the volatility of the resources used to built it and the dynamic environment it operates in it can also be called peertopeer clouds or adhoc clouds an interesting effort in such direction is cloudhome it aims to implement a cloud computing infrastructure using volunteered resources providing a businessmodel to incentivize contributions through financial restitution111 intercloudedit main article intercloud the intercloud112 is an interconnected global cloud of clouds113114 and an extension of the internet network of networks on which it is based the focus is on direct interoperability between public cloud service providers more so than between providers and consumers as is the case for hybrid and multicloud115116117 multicloudedit main article multicloud multicloud is the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single heterogeneous architecture to reduce reliance on single vendors increase flexibility through choice mitigate against disasters etc it differs from hybrid cloud in that it refers to multiple cloud services rather than multiple deployment modes public private legacy118119120 architectureedit cloud computing sample architecture cloud architecture121 the systems architecture of the software systems involved in the delivery of cloud computing typically involves multiple cloud components communicating with each other over a loose coupling mechanism such as a messaging queue elastic provision implies intelligence in the use of tight or loose coupling as applied to mechanisms such as these and others cloud engineeringedit cloud engineering is the application of engineering disciplines to cloud computing it brings a systematic approach to the highlevel concerns of commercialization standardization and governance in conceiving developing operating and maintaining cloud computing systems it is a multidisciplinary method encompassing contributions from diverse areas such as systems software web performance information security platform risk and quality engineering security and privacyedit main article cloud computing issues cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is in the cloud at any time it could accidentally or deliberately alter or even delete information122 many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order even without a warrant that is permitted in their privacy policies which users must agree to before they start using cloud services solutions to privacy include policy and legislation as well as end users choices for how data is stored122 users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access3122 according to the cloud security alliance the top three threats in the cloud are insecure interfaces and apis data loss leakage and hardware failure—which accounted for 29 25 and 10 of all cloud security outages respectively together these form shared technology vulnerabilities in a cloud provider platform being shared by different users there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on same data server therefore information leakage may arise by mistake when information for one customer is given to other123 additionally eugene schultz chief technology officer at emagined security said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud there are some real achilles heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attack—a process he called hyperjacking some examples of this include the dropbox security breach and icloud 2014 leak124 dropbox had been breached in october 2014 having over 7 million of its users passwords stolen by hackers in an effort to get monetary value from it by bitcoins btc by having these passwords they are able to read private data as well as have this data be indexed by search engines making the information public124 there is the problem of legal ownership of the data if a user stores some data in the cloud can the cloud provider profit from it many terms of service agreements are silent on the question of ownership125 physical control of the computer equipment private cloud is more secure than having the equipment off site and under someone elses control public cloud this delivers great incentive to public cloud computing service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management of secure services126 some small businesses that dont have expertise in it security could find that its more secure for them to use a public cloud there is the risk that end users do not understand the issues involved when signing on to a cloud service persons sometimes dont read the many pages of the terms of service agreement and just click accept without reading this is important now that cloud computing is becoming popular and required for some services to work for example for an intelligent personal assistant apples siri or google now fundamentally private cloud is seen as more secure with higher levels of control for the owner however public cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less time and money investment from the user127 limitations and disadvantagesedit according to bruce schneier the downside is that you will have limited customization options cloud computing is cheaper because of economics of scale and — like any outsourced task — you tend to get what you get a restaurant with a limited menu is cheaper than a personal chef who can cook anything you want fewer options at a much cheaper price its a feature not a bug he also suggests that the cloud provider might not meet your legal needs and that businesses need to weigh the benefits of cloud computing against the risks128 in cloud computing the control of the back end infrastructure is limited to the cloud vendor only cloud providers often decide on the management policies which moderates what the cloud users are able to do with their deployment129 cloud users are also limited to the control and management of their applications data and services130 this includes data caps which are placed on cloud users by the cloud vendor allocating certain amount of bandwidth for each customer and are often shared among other cloud users131 privacy and confidentiality are big concerns in some activities for instance sworn translators working under the stipulations of an nda might face problems regarding sensitive data that are not encrypted132 emerging trendsedit cloud computing is still a subject of research133 a driving factor in the evolution of cloud computing has been chief technology officers seeking to minimize risk of internal outages and mitigate the complexity of housing network and computing hardware inhouse134 major cloud technology companies invest billions of dollars per year in cloud research and development for example in 2011 microsoft committed 90 percent of its 96 billion rd budget to its cloud135 research by investment bank centaur partners in late 2015 forecasted that saas revenue would grow from 135 billion in 2011 to 328 billion in 2016136 see alsoedit
