nations auspices dulles wrote7 if we as a professedly christian nation feel morally free to use atomic energy in that way men elsewhere will accept that verdict atomic weapons will be looked upon as a normal part of the arsenal of war and the stage will be set for the sudden and final destruction of mankind dulles never lost his anxiety about the destructive power of nuclear weapons but his views on international control and on employing the threat of atomic attack changed in the face of the berlin blockade the soviet detonation of an abomb and the advent of the korean war these convinced him

the anzus treaty for mutual protection with australia and new zealand dulles strongly opposed communism believing it was godless terrorism12 one of his first major policy shifts towards a more aggressive position against communism occurred in march 1953 when dulles supported eisenhowers decision to direct the central intelligence agency cia then headed by his brother allen dulles to draft plans to overthrow the prime minister mohammed mossadegh of iran13 this led directly to the coup détat via operation ajax in support of mohammad reza pahlavi who became the shah of iran in 1954 dulles

exceptional circumstances it is an immoral and shortsighted conception18 throughout the 1950s dulles was in frequent conflict with those nonaligned statesmen he deemed excessively sympathetic to communism including indias vk krishna menon in november 1956 dulles strongly opposed the anglofrench invasion of the suez canal zone in response to the suez crisis during the most crucial days he was hospitalized after surgery and did not participate in washingtons decisionmaking however by 1958 dulles had become an outspoken opponent of president gamal abdel nasser of egypt and prevented him from
