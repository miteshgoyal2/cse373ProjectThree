fawkes night also known as guy fawkes day bonfire night and firework night is an annual commemoration observed on 5 november primarily in great britain its history begins with the events of 5 november 1605 when guy fawkes a member of the gunpowder plot was arrested while guarding explosives the plotters had placed beneath the house of lords celebrating the fact that king james i had survived the attempt on his life people lit bonfires around london and months later the introduction of the observance of 5th november act enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plots failure within a few decades gunpowder treason day as it was known became the predominant english state commemoration but as it carried strong protestant religious overtones it also became a focus for anticatholic sentiment puritans delivered sermons regarding the perceived dangers of popery while during increasingly raucous celebrations common folk burnt effigies of popular hatefigures such as the pope towards the end of the 18th century reports appear of children begging for money with effigies of guy fawkes and 5 november gradually became known as guy fawkes day towns such as lewes and guildford were in the 19th century scenes of increasingly violent classbased confrontations fostering traditions those towns celebrate still albeit peaceably in the 1850s changing attitudes resulted in the toning down of much of the days anticatholic rhetoric and the observance of 5th november act was repealed in 1859 eventually the violence was dealt with and by the 20th century guy fawkes day had become an enjoyable social commemoration although lacking much of its original focus the presentday guy fawkes night is usually celebrated at large organised events centred on a bonfire and extravagant firework displays settlers exported guy fawkes night to overseas colonies including some in north america where it was known as pope day those festivities died out with the onset of the american revolution claims that guy fawkes night was a protestant replacement for older customs like samhain are disputed although another old celebration halloween has lately increased in popularity and according to

gunpowder plot of 1605 a failed conspiracy by a group of provincial english catholics to assassinate the protestant king james i of england and replace him with a catholic head of state in the immediate aftermath of the 5 november arrest of guy fawkes caught guarding a cache of explosives placed beneath the house of lords jamess council allowed the public to celebrate the kings survival with bonfires so long as they were without any danger or disorder1 this made 1605 the first year the plots failure was celebrated2 the following january days before the surviving conspirators were executed parliament passed the observance of 5th november act commonly known as the thanksgiving act it was proposed by a puritan member of parliament edward montagu who suggested that the kings apparent deliverance by divine intervention deserved some measure of official recognition and kept 5 november free as a day of thanksgiving while in theory making attendance at church mandatory3 a new form of service was also added to the church of englands book of common prayer for use on that date4 little is known about the earliest celebrations in settlements such as carlisle norwich and nottingham corporations provided music and artillery salutes canterbury celebrated 5 november 1607 with 106 pounds of gunpowder and 14 pounds of match and three years later food and drink was provided for local dignitaries as well as music explosions and a parade by the local militia even less is known of how the occasion was first commemorated by the general public although records indicate that in the protestant stronghold of dorchester a sermon was read the church bells rung and bonfires and fireworks lit5 early significance according to historian and author antonia fraser a study of the earliest sermons preached demonstrates an anticatholic concentration mystical in its fervour6 delivering one of five 5 november sermons printed in a mappe of rome in 1612 thomas taylor spoke of the generality of his a papists cruelty which had been almost without bounds7 such messages were also spread in printed works like francis herrings pietas pontifica republished in 1610 as popish piety and john rhodes a brief summe of the treason intended against the king state which in 1606 sought to educate the simple and ignorant that they be not seduced any longer by papists8 by the 1620s the fifth was honoured in market towns and villages across the country though it was some years before it was commemorated throughout england gunpowder treason day as it was then known became the predominant english state commemoration some parishes made the day a festive occasion with public drinking and solemn processions concerned though about jamess prospanish foreign policy the decline of international protestantism and catholicism in general protestant clergymen who recognised the days significance called for more dignified and profound thanksgivings each 5 november910 what unity english protestants had shared in the plots immediate aftermath began to fade when in 1625 jamess son the future charles i married the catholic henrietta maria of france puritans reacted to the marriage by issuing a new prayer to warn against rebellion and catholicism and on 5 november that year effigies of the pope and the devil were burnt the earliest such report of this practice and the beginning of centuries of traditiona14 during charless reign gunpowder treason day became increasingly partisan between 1629 and 1640 he ruled without parliament and he seemed to support arminianism regarded by puritans like henry burton as a step toward catholicism by 1636 under the leadership of the arminian archbishop of canterbury william laud the english church was trying to use 5 november to denounce all seditious practices and not just popery15 puritans went on the defensive some pressing for further reformation of the church9 revellers in lewes 5 november 2010 bonfire night as it was occasionally known16 assumed a new fervour during the events leading up to the english interregnum although royalists disputed their interpretations parliamentarians began to uncover or fear new catholic plots preaching before the house of commons on 5 november 1644 charles herle claimed that papists were tunnelling from oxford rome hell to westminster and there to blow up if possible the better foundations of your houses their liberties and privileges17 a display in 1647 at lincolns inn fields commemorated gods great mercy in delivering this kingdom from the hellish plots of papists and included fireballs burning in the water symbolising a catholic association with infernal spirits and fireboxes their many rockets suggestive of popish spirits coming from below to enact plots against the king effigies of fawkes and the pope were present the latter represented by pluto roman god of the underworld18 following charles is execution in 1649 the countrys new republican regime remained undecided on how to treat 5 november unlike the old system of religious feasts and state anniversaries it survived but as a celebration of parliamentary government and protestantism and not of monarchy16 commonly the day was still marked by bonfires and miniature explosives but formal celebrations resumed only with the restoration when charles ii became king courtiers high anglicans and tories followed the official line that the event marked gods preservation of the english throne but generally the celebrations became more diverse by 1670 london apprentices had turned 5 november into a fire festival attacking not only popery but also sobriety and good order19 demanding money from coach occupants for alcohol and bonfires the burning of effigies largely unknown to the jacobeans20 continued in 1673 when charless brother the duke of york converted to catholicism in response accompanied by a procession of about 1000 people the apprentices fired an effigy of the whore of babylon bedecked with a range of papal symbols2122 similar scenes occurred over the following few years on 17 november 1677 anticatholic fervour saw the accession day marked by the burning of a large effigy of the pope—his belly filled with live cats who squalled most hideously as soon as they felt the fire—and two effigies of devils whispering in his ear two years later as the exclusion crisis reached its zenith an observer noted that the 5th at night being gunpowder treason there were many bonfires and burning of popes as has ever been seen violent scenes in 1682 forced londons militia into action and to prevent any repetition the following year a proclamation was issued banning bonfires and fireworks23 fireworks were also banned under james ii who became king in 1685 attempts by the government to tone down gunpowder treason day celebrations were however largely unsuccessful and some reacted to a ban on bonfires in london born from a fear of more burnings of the popes effigy by placing candles in their windows as a witness against catholicism24 when james was deposed in 1688 by william of orange—who importantly landed in england on 5 november—the days events turned also to the celebration of freedom and religion with elements of antijacobitism while the earlier ban on bonfires was politically motivated a ban on fireworks was maintained for safety reasons much mischief having been done by squibs16 guy fawkes day the restoration of the catholic hierarchy in 1850 provoked a strong reaction this sketch is from an issue of punch printed in november that year william iiis birthday fell on 4 novemberb and for orthodox whigs the two days therefore became an important double anniversary25 william ordered that the thanksgiving service for 5 november be amended to include thanks for his happy arrival and the deliverance of our church and nation26 in the 1690s he reestablished protestant rule in ireland and the fifth occasionally marked by the ringing of church bells and civic dinners was consequently eclipsed by his birthday commemorations from the 19th century 5 november celebrations there became sectarian in nature its celebration in northern ireland remains controversial unlike in scotland where bonfires continue to be lit in various cities27 in england though as one of 49 official holidays for the ruling class 5 november became overshadowed by events such as the birthdays of admiral edward vernon or john wilkes and under george ii and george iii with the exception of the jacobite rising of 1745 it was largely a polite entertainment rather than an occasion for vitriolic thanksgiving28 for the lower classes however the anniversary was a chance to pit disorder against order a pretext for violence and uncontrolled revelry at some point for reasons that are unclear it became customary to burn guy fawkes in effigy rather than the pope gradually gunpowder treason day became guy fawkes day in 1790 the times reported instances of children begging for money for guy faux29 and a report of 4 november 1802 described how a set of idle fellows  with some horrid figure dressed up as a guy faux were convicted of begging and receiving money and committed to prison as idle and disorderly persons30 the fifth became a polysemous occasion replete with polyvalent crossreferencing meaning all things to all men31 lower class rioting continued with reports in lewes of annual rioting intimidation of respectable householders32 and the rolling through the streets of lit tar barrels in guildford gangs of revellers who called themselves guys terrorised the local population proceedings were concerned more with the settling of old arguments and general mayhem than any historical reminiscences33 similar problems arose in exeter originally the scene of more traditional celebrations in 1831 an effigy was burnt of the new bishop of exeter henry phillpotts a high church anglican and high tory who opposed parliamentary reform and who was also suspected of being involved in creeping popery a local ban on fireworks in 1843 was largely ignored and attempts by the authorities to suppress the celebrations resulted in violent protests and several injured constables34 a group of children in caernarfon november 1962 stand with their guy fawkes effigy the sign reads penny for the guy in welsh on several occasions during the 19th century the times reported that the tradition was in decline being of late years almost forgotten but in the opinion of historian david cressy such reports reflected other victorian trends including a lessening of protestant religious zeal—not general observance of the fifth29 civil unrest brought about by the union of the kingdoms of great britain and ireland in 1800 resulted in parliament passing the roman catholic relief act 1829 which afforded catholics greater civil rights continuing the process of catholic emancipation in the two kingdoms35 the traditional denunciations of catholicism had been in decline since the early 18th century36 and were thought by many including queen victoria to be outdated37 but the popes restoration in 1850 of the english catholic hierarchy gave renewed significance to 5 november as demonstrated by the burnings of effigies of the new catholic archbishop of westminster nicholas wiseman and the pope at farringdon market 14 effigies were processed from the strand and over westminster bridge to southwark while extensive demonstrations were held throughout the suburbs of london38 effigies of the 12 new english catholic bishops were paraded through exeter already the scene of severe public disorder on each anniversary of the fifth39 gradually however such scenes became less popular with little resistance in parliament the thanksgiving prayer of 5 november contained in the anglican book of common prayer was abolished and in march 1859 the anniversary days observance act repealed the observance of 5th november act404142 as the authorities dealt with the worst excesses public decorum was gradually restored the sale of fireworks was restricted43 and the guildford guys were neutralized in 1865 although this was too late for one constable who died of his wounds37 violence continued in exeter for some years peaking in 1867 when incensed by rising food prices and banned from firing their customary bonfire a mob was twice in one night driven from cathedral close by armed infantry further riots occurred in 1879 but there were no more bonfires in cathedral close after 18944445 elsewhere sporadic instances of public disorder persisted late into the 20th century accompanied by large numbers of fireworkrelated accidents but a national firework code and improved public safety has in most cases brought an end to such things46 songs guys and decline one notable aspect of the victorians commemoration of guy fawkes night was its move away from the centres of communities to their margins gathering wood for the bonfire increasingly became the province of workingclass children who solicited combustible materials money food and drink from wealthier neighbours often with the aid of songs most opened with the familiar remember remember the fifth of november gunpowder treason and plot47 the earliest recorded rhyme from 1742 is reproduced below alongside one bearing similarities to most guy fawkes night ditties recorded in 1903 at charlton on otmoor dont you remember the fifth of november twas gunpowder treason day i let off my gun and madeem all run and stole all their bonfire away 174248 the fifth of november since i can remember was guy faux poke him in the eye shove him up the chimneypot and there let him die a stick and a stake for king georges sake if you dont give me one ill take two the better for me and the worse for you ricketaracket your hedges shall go 190347 spectators gather around a bonfire at himley hall near dudley on 6 november 2010 organised entertainments also became popular in the late 19th century and 20thcentury pyrotechnic manufacturers renamed guy fawkes day as firework night sales of fireworks dwindled somewhat during the first world war but resumed in the following peace49 at the start of the second world war celebrations were again suspended resuming in november 194550 for many families guy fawkes night became a domestic celebration and children often congregated on street corners accompanied by their own effigy of guy fawkes51 this was sometimes ornately dressed and sometimes a barely recognisable bundle of rags stuffed with whatever filling was suitable a survey found that in 1981 about 23 percent of sheffield schoolchildren made guys sometimes weeks before the event collecting money was a popular reason for their creation the children taking their effigy from door to door or displaying it on street corners but mainly they were built to go on the bonfire itself sometimes comprising wood stolen from other pyres an acceptable convention that helped bolster another november tradition mischief night52 rival gangs competed to see who could build the largest sometimes even burning the wood collected by their opponents in 1954 the yorkshire post reported on fires late in september a situation that forced the authorities to remove latent piles of wood for safety reasons53 lately however the custom of begging for a penny for the guy has almost completely disappeared51 in contrast some older customs still survive in ottery st mary men chase each other through the streets with lit tar barrels54 and since 1679 lewes has been the setting of some of englands most extravagant 5 november celebrations the lewes bonfire55 generally modern 5 november celebrations are run by local charities and other organisations with paid admission and controlled access in 1998 an editorial in the catholic herald called for the end of bonfire night labelling it an offensive act56 author martin kettle writing in the guardian in 2003 bemoaned an occasionally nannyish attitude to fireworks that discourages people from holding firework displays in their back gardens and an unduly sensitive attitude toward the anticatholic sentiment once so prominent on guy fawkes night57 david cressy summarised the modern celebration with these words the rockets go higher and burn with more colour but they have less and less to do with memories of the fifth of november  it might be observed that guy fawkes day is finally declining having lost its connection with politics and religion but we have heard that many times before58 similarities with other customs spectators watch a fireworks display in november 2014 historians have often suggested that guy fawkes day served as a protestant replacement for the ancient celtic festival of samhain or calan gaeaf pagan events that the church absorbed and transformed into all hallows eve and all souls day in the golden bough the scottish anthropologist james george frazer suggested that guy fawkes day exemplifies the recrudescence of old customs in modern shapes david underdown writing in his 1987 work revel riot and rebellion viewed gunpowder treason day as a replacement for halloween just as the early church had taken over many of the pagan feasts so did protestants acquire their own rituals adapting older forms or providing substitutes for them59 while the use of bonfires to mark the occasion was most likely taken from the ancient practice of lighting celebratory bonfires the idea that the commemoration of 5 november 1605 ever originated from anything other than the safety of james i is according to david cressy speculative nonsense60 citing cressys work ronald hutton agrees with his conclusion writing there is in brief nothing to link the halloween fires of north wales man and central scotland with those which appeared in england upon 5 november61 further confusion arises in northern ireland where some communities celebrate guy fawkes night the distinction there between the fifth and halloween is not always clear62 despite such disagreements in 2005 david cannadine commented on the encroachment into british culture of late 20thcentury american halloween celebrations and their effect on guy fawkes night nowadays family bonfire gatherings are much less popular and many oncelarge civic celebrations have been given up because of increasingly intrusive health and safety regulations but 5 november has also been overtaken by a popular festival that barely existed when i was growing up and that is halloween  britain is not the protestant nation it was when i was young it is now a multifaith society and the americanised halloween is sweeping all before it—a vivid reminder of just how powerfully american culture and american consumerism can be transported across the atlantic63 reporting on the same topic in 2012 the bbcs tom de castella concluded its probably not a case of bonfire night decline but rather a shift in priorities  there are new trends in the bonfire ritual guy fawkes masks have proved popular and some of the more quirky bonfire societies have replaced the guy with effigies of celebrities in the news – including lance armstrong and mario balotelli – and even politicians the emphasis has moved the bonfire with a guy on top – indeed the whole story of the gunpowder plot – has been marginalised but the spectacle remains64 another celebration involving fireworks the fiveday hindu festival of diwali normally observed between midoctober and november in 2010 began on 5 november this led the independent to comment on the similarities between the two its reporter kevin rawlinson wondering which fireworks will burn brightest65 in other countries 1768 colonial commemoration of 5 november 1605 gunpowder treason day was exported by settlers to colonies around the world including members of the commonwealth of nations such as australia new zealand canada and various caribbean nations66 the day is still marked in saint vincent and the grenadines and in saint kitts and nevis but a fireworks ban by antigua and barbuda during the 1990s reduced its popularity in that country67 in australia sydney founded as a penal colony in 178868 saw at least one instance of the parading and burning of a guy fawkes effigy in 180569 while in 1833 four years after its founding70 perth had gunpowder treason day listed as a public holiday71 by the 1970s guy fawkes night had become less common in australia some measure of celebration remains in new zealand canada and south africa72 in north america the commemoration was at first paid scant attention but the arrest of two boys caught lighting bonfires on 5 november 1662 in boston suggests in historian james sharpes view that an underground tradition of commemorating the fifth existed73 in parts of north america it was known as pope day celebrated mainly in colonial new england but also as far south as charleston in boston founded in 1630 by puritan settlers led by john winthrop an early celebration was held in 1685 the same year that james ii assumed the throne fifty years later again in boston a local minister wrote a great number of people went over to dorchester neck where at night they made a great bonfire and plaid off many fireworks although the day ended in tragedy when 4 young men coming home in a canoe were all drowned ten years later the raucous celebrations were the cause of considerable annoyance to the upper classes and a special riot act was passed to prevent riotous tumultuous and disorderly assemblies of more than three persons all or any of them armed with sticks clubs or any kind of weapons or disguised with vizards or painted or discolored faces on in any manner disguised having any kind of imagery or pageantry in any street lane or place in boston with inadequate resources however bostons authorities were powerless to enforce the act in the 1740s gang violence became common with groups of boston residents battling for the honour of burning the popes effigy but by the mid1760s these riots had subsided and as colonial america moved towards revolution the class rivalries featured during pope day gave way to antibritish sentiment74 in author alfred youngs view pope day provided the scaffolding symbolism and leadership for resistance to the stamp act in 1764–65 forgoing previous gang rivalries in favour of unified resistance to britain75 the passage in 1774 of the quebec act which guaranteed french canadians free practice of catholicism in the province of quebec provoked complaints from some americans that the british were introducing popish principles and french law76 such fears were bolstered by opposition from the church in europe to american independence threatening a revival of pope day77 commenting in 1775 george washington was less than impressed by the thought of any such resurrections forbidding any under his command from participating78 as the commander in chief has been apprized of a design formd for the observance of that ridiculous and childish custom of burning the effigy of the pope—he cannot help expressing his surprise that there should be officers and soldiers in this army so void of common sense as not to see the impropriety of such a step at this juncture at a time when we are solliciting and have really obtaind the friendship and alliance of the people of canada whom we ought to consider as brethren embarked in the same cause the defence of the general liberty of america at such a juncture and in such circumstances to be insulting their religion is so monstrous as not to be suffered or excused indeed instead of offering the most remote insult it is our duty to address public thanks to these our brethren as to them we are so much indebted for every late happy success over the common enemy in canada79 generally following washingtons complaint american colonists stopped observing pope day although according to the bostonian society some citizens of boston celebrated it on one final occasion in 177680 the tradition continued in salem as late as 181781 and was still observed in portsmouth new hampshire in 189282 in the late 18th century effigies of prominent figures such as two prime ministers of great britain the earl of bute and lord north and the american traitor general benedict arnold were also burnt83 in the 1880s bonfires were still being lit in some new england coastal towns although no longer to commemorate the failure of the gunpowder plot in the area around new york stacks of barrels were burnt on election day eve which after 1845 was a tuesday early in november84 see also holidays portal bonfire toffee gunpowder plot in popular culture push penny sussex bonfire societies west country carnival references notes
