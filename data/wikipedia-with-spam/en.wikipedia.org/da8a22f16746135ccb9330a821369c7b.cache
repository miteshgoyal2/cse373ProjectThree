famed entertainer danny kaye and lester smith at that time kayesmith were also the owners of the number one pop music station in seattle kjr4 by 1971 kisw had switched to a progressive rock or underground format pioneered by tom donahue at kmpx and ksan in san francisco5 kisw was not the first commercial station in the seattletacoma market to experiment with rock and roll programming on the fm radio dial kol had already accomplished some success with their fm frequency through the early and midseventies kisw evolved as most of the fm progressive stations did into the more tightly controlled album oriented rock aor format a key period in kisw’s history began in the late1970s when the station adopted the slogan seattle’s best rock seeming to embrace a younger more bluecollar aesthetic than seattle’s other aor stations kisw added hard rock and heavy metal into the music mix even in the mornings kisw worked with radio consultants burkhartabrams lee abrams had developed a successful hybrid of aor that applied the principles of top 40 station manager steve west and program director beau phillips developed what would be a long line of topnotch clever and irreverent kisw

extraordinarily popular but after kisw was sold and management changed both teams left the station together in 1987 to start rival rock station kxrx the exit of crow west with robin maynard threw kisw
