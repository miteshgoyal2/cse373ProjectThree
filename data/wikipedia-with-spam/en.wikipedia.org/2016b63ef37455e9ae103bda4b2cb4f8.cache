regrading in seattle from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a regrade in progress circa 1907 the building under construction is the new washington hotel now the josephinium at the corner of second and stewart denny regrade no 1 in progress circa 1910 the topography of central seattle was radically altered by a series of regrades in the citys first century of urban settlement in what might have been the largest such alteration of urban terrain at the time1 the heart of seattle largest city in the state of washington is on an isthmus between the citys chief harbor—the saltwater elliott bay an inlet of puget sound—and the fresh water of lake washington capitol hill first hill and beacon hill collectively constitute a ridge along this isthmus in addition at the time the city was founded the steep denny hill stood in the area now known as belltown or the denny regrade when white settlers first came to seattle in the early 1850s the tides of elliott bay lapped at the base of beacon hill2 the original location of the settlement that became seattle—todays pioneer square—was a lowlying island a series of regrades leveled paths for roads demolished denny hill and turned much of jackson hill a remnant of which remains along main street in the international district into a nearcanyon between first and beacon hills the roughly 50000000 short tons 45400000 t of earth from these 60 regrades1 provided landfill for the citys waterfront and the industrialcommercial neighborhood now known as sodo and built harbor island at the time the largest manmade island in the world contents 1 the early years 2 cutting through beacon hill 3 the denny regrade 4 notes 5 references 6 further reading the early yearsedit railroad avenue todays alaskan way depicted here in 1900 was built on fill from the early regrades to the right in this picture casting shadows are the wharves of the central waterfront seattles first 58 regrades consisted largely of cutting the tops off high places and dumping the dirt into low places and onto the beach3 the most dramatic result of this was along that former beach filling the land that constitutes todays central waterfront todays western avenue and alaskan way lie on this landfill3 these informal regrades came to an end around 1900 later regrades typically required changes to areas that had already undergone some development city engineer rh thomson established his prestige in 1900 he successfully provided the city with ample fresh water by running a pipeline from the cedar river he then undertook to level the extreme hills that rose south and north of the bustling city center cutting through beacon hilledit looking south from pine street on the south slope of denny hill 1880 the wide bay at the foot of beacon hill is now the location of the sodo neighborhood the dearborn regrade in progress 1912 looking west towards the 12th avenue south bridge jose p rizal bridge constructed the previous year the first unsuccessful attempt to pierce the capitol hill – first hill – beacon hill ridge came at the end of this era of informal regrades in 1895 former territorial governor eugene semple 1840–1908 proposed several ambitious plans to reengineer seattle one of these which he undertook in 1901 was to dig a canal from elliott bay to lake washington by cutting through beacon hill4 in roughly the area of spokane street2 sluicing earth into the tide flats his effort was defeated by unstable soils which caused several caveins and by the legal and political maneuvering of judge thomas burke and others aligned with the great northern railway the lake washington ship canal ultimately followed the route north of downtown favored by burke5 utilizing existing lakes and bays4 semple left behind a canyon that is now used by the spokane street interchange on interstate 52 thomson resumed the work of cutting through beacon hill to connect central seattle to the rainier valley the first of his major regrades4 but he made his cut farther north the jackson regrade between 1907 and 1910 slashed 85 feet 259 m from the hill3 requiring the demolition of the public south school and the original holy names academy2 but providing fill for the tide flats below beacon hill that stretched south from king street filling in todays sodo jackson street became a slow slope upward from elliott bay in the west to the central district east of the capitol hill – first hill – beacon hill ridge3 shortly afterward just south of the jackson regrade the dearborn street regrade made an even deeper cut through the ridge in one place the level of the land was lowered by 108 feet 329 m 1600000 cubic yards 1223288 m3 of earth were moved6 as with semples abandoned canal there were several landslides and many homes were destroyed that were not originally planned to be removed2 the resulting gap at dearborn street was deep enough to require a bridge running roughly northsouth originally known as the 12th avenue south bridge and now known as the jose p rizal bridge it is now on the national register of historic places the denny regradeedit a postcard shows the washington hotel atop denny hill before denny regrade no 1 and the new washington hotel the dark building in the lower picture now the josephinum built on the newly leveled land the 1884 denny school depicted here in 1900 on battery street between fifth sixth avenues was demolished in 1928 one of many major buildings demolished as part of denny regrade no 2 the denny regrade began before the jackson and dearborn regrades but the last stage was not completed until decades later before regrading the muchadmired denny school7 and the upmarket washington hotel stood atop the hill8 along with numerous residential buildings9 although in retrospect it is referred to as the denny regrade and the name has become the name of a neighborhood there were in fact several separate regrades of the former denny hill beginning with privatesector efforts around 1900 property owners along relatively lowlying first avenue took it upon themselves to cut through from pike street to cedar street a similar cut but initiated by the city lowered second avenue in 1904 around the same time the south part of the hill was shaved off as pike and pine streets were regraded between second and fifth avenues6 the more dramatic denny regrade no 1 1908–1911 sluiced away the entire half of the hill closest to the waterfront about 27 city blocks extending from pine street to cedar street and from second to fifth avenues 20000000 us gallons 75708 kl of water a day were pumped from lake union to be aimed at the hill as jets of water then run through tunnels to elliott bay6 much of the motivation for the regrade had been to increase land values but the area opened up—the heart of todays belltown—was left as a strip cut off from much of the rest of the city by the remaining eastern half of the hill whose western face offered no route of approach meanwhile propertyowners and investors hesitated to build on the remaining portion of the hill because they considered it likely that their buildings would eventually be destroyed in the next phase of the regrading process which was now well under way6 the result was denny regrade no 2 begun in february 1929 and lasting 22 months this time the technology was power shovels rather than sluicing with earth carried to the waterfront by conveyor belts then placed on specially designed scows and dumped in deep water6 the scows were intentionally designed to capsize in a controlled manner they were symmetrical toptobottom and side to side a seacock could be opened to fill one side with water in three minutes it would capsize dump its load bob up empty the tank and right itself10 one of the buildings demolished in denny regrade no 2 was the denny school on battery street between 5th and 6th avenues opened in 1884 it had been described as an architectural jewel the finest schoolhouse on the west coast7 while the 38 blocks were being regraded the country entered the great depression radically reducing the demand for land most of the new lots sat vacant into the 1940s1 the area especially east of sixth avenue remained a gray zone into the early 21st century when it finally began to gain an urban or suburban identity as the west edge of the new growth of south lake
