router computing from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about the network device for the woodworking tool see router woodworking a cisco asm232em router deployed at cern in 1987 a routera is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks routers perform the traffic directing functions on the internet a data packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an internetwork until it reaches its destination node2 a router is connected to two or more data lines from different networksb when a data packet comes in on one of the lines the router reads the network address information in the packet to determine the ultimate destination then using information in its routing table or routing policy it directs the packet to the next network on its journey the most familiar type of routers are home and small office routers that simply pass ip packets between the home computers and the internet an example of a router would be the owners cable or dsl router which connects to the internet through an internet service provider isp more sophisticated routers such as enterprise routers connect large business or isp networks up to the powerful core routers that forward data at high speed along the optical fiber lines of the internet backbone though routers are typically dedicated hardware devices softwarebased routers also exist contents 1 operation 2 applications 21 access 22 distribution 23 security 24 core 25 internet connectivity and internal use 3 historical and technical information 4 forwarding 5 see also 6 notes 7 references 8 external links operationedit when multiple routers are used in interconnected networks the routers can exchange information about destination addresses using a routing protocol each router builds up a routing table listing the preferred routes between any two systems on the interconnected networks3 a router has two types of network element components organized onto separate planes4 control plane a router maintains a routing table that lists which route should be used to forward a data packet and through which physical interface connection it does this using internal preconfigured directives called static routes or by learning routes dynamically using a routing protocol static and dynamic routes are stored in the routing table the controlplane logic then strips nonessential directives from the table and builds a forwarding information base fib to be used by the forwarding plane forwarding plane the router forwards data packets between incoming and outgoing interface connections it forwards them to the correct network type using information that the packet header contains matched to entries in the fib supplied by the control plane applicationsedit a typical home or small office dsl router showing the telephone socket left white to connect it to the internet using adsl and ethernet jacks right yellow to connect it to home computers and printers a router may have interfaces for different types physical layer connections such as copper cables fiber optic or wireless transmission its can also support different network layer transmission standards each network interface is used to enable data packets to be forwarded from one transmission system to another routers may also be used to connect two or more logical groups of computer devices known as subnets each with a different network prefix routers may provide connectivity within enterprises between enterprises and the internet or between internet service providers isps networks the largest routers such as the cisco crs1 or juniper ptx interconnect the various isps or may be used in large enterprise networks5 smaller routers usually provide connectivity for typical home and office networks all sizes of routers may be found inside enterprises6 the most powerful routers are usually found in isps academic and research facilities large businesses may also need more powerful routers to cope with everincreasing demands of intranet data traffic a hierarchical internetworking model for interconnecting routers in large networks is in common use7 accessedit a screenshot of the luci web interface used by openwrt this page configures dynamic dns access routers including small officehome office soho models are located at customer sites such as branch offices that do not need hierarchical routing of their own typically they are optimized for low cost some soho routers are capable of running alternative free linuxbased firmware like tomato openwrt or ddwrt8 distributionedit distribution routers aggregate traffic from multiple access routers either at the same site or to collect the data streams from multiple sites to a major enterprise location distribution routers are often responsible for enforcing quality of service across a wide area network wan so they may have considerable memory installed multiple wan interface connections and substantial onboard data processing routines they may also provide connectivity to groups of file servers or other external networks securityedit see also universal plug and play § problems with upnp and wifi protected setup § vulnerabilities external networks must be carefully considered as part of the overall security strategy of the local network a router may include a firewall vpn handling and other security functions or these may be handled by separate devices many companies produced securityoriented routers including cisco pix series cisco meraki mx series and juniper netscreen routers also commonly perform network address translation which allows multiple devices on a network to share a single public ip address91011 and stateful packet inspection some experts argue that open source routers are more secure and reliable than closed source routers because open source routers allow mistakes to be quickly found and corrected12 coreedit in enterprises a core router may provide a collapsed backbone interconnecting the distribution tier routers from multiple buildings of a campus or large enterprise locations they tend to be optimized for high bandwidth but lack some of the features of edge routers13 internet connectivity and internal useedit routers intended for isp and major enterprise connectivity usually exchange routing information using the border gateway protocol bgp rfc 4098 standard defines the types of bgp routers according to their functions14 edge router also called a provider edge router is placed at the edge of an isp network the router uses external bgp to ebgp routers in other isps or a large enterprise autonomous system subscriber edge router also called a customer edge router is located at the edge of the subscribers network it also uses ebgp to its providers autonomous system it is typically used in an enterprise organization interprovider border router interconnecting isps is a bgp router that maintains bgp sessions with other bgp routers in isp autonomous systems core router a core router resides within an autonomous system as a back bone to carry traffic between edge routers15 within an isp in the isps autonomous system a router uses internal bgp to communicate with other isp edge routers other intranet core routers or the isps intranet provider border routers internet backbone the internet no longer has a clearly identifiable backbone unlike its predecessor networks see defaultfree zone dfz the major isps system routers make up what could be considered to be the current internet backbone core16 isps operate all four types of the bgp routers described here an isp core router is used to interconnect its edge and border routers core routers may also have specialized functions in virtual private networks based on a combination of bgp and multiprotocol label switching protocols17 port forwarding routers are also used for port forwarding between private internetconnected servers6 voicedatafaxvideo processing routers commonly referred to as access servers or gateways these devices are used to route and process voice data video and fax traffic on the internet since 2005 most longdistance phone calls have been processed as ip traffic voip through a voice gateway use of access server type routers expanded with the advent of the internet first with dialup access and another resurgence with voice phone service larger networks commonly use multilayer switches with layer 3 devices being used to simply interconnect multiple subnets within the same security zone and higher layer switches when filtering translation load balancing or other higher level functions are required especially between zones historical and technical informationedit the first arpanet router the interface message processor delivered to ucla august 30 1969 and went online october 29 1969 the concept of an interface computer was first used by donald davies for the npl network in 196618 the interface message processor imp conceived in 1967 for use in the arpanet had fundamentally the same functionality as a router does today the idea for a router called gateways at the time initially came about through an international group of computer networking researchers called the international network working group inwg set up in 1972 as an informal group to consider the technical issues involved in connecting different networks later that year it became a subcommittee of the international federation for information processing19 these devices were different from most previous packet switching schemes in two ways first they connected dissimilar kinds of networks such as serial lines and local area networks second they were connectionless devices which had no role in assuring that traffic was delivered reliably leaving that entirely to the hostsc the idea was explored in more detail with the intention to produce a prototype system as part of two contemporaneous programs one was the initial darpainitiated program which created the tcpip architecture in use today20 the other was a program at xerox parc to explore new networking technologies which produced the parc universal packet system due to corporate intellectual property concerns it received little attention outside xerox for years21 some time after early 1974 the first xerox routers became operational the first true ip router was developed by virginia strazisar at bbn as part of that darpainitiated effort during 19751976 by the end of 1976 three pdp11based routers were in service in the experimental prototype internet22 the first multiprotocol routers were independently created by staff researchers at mit and stanford in 1981 the stanford router was done by william yeager and the mit one by noel chiappa both were also based on pdp11s23242526 virtually all networking now uses tcpip but multiprotocol routers are still manufactured they were important in the early stages of the growth of computer networking when protocols other than tcpip were in use modern internet routers that handle both ipv4 and ipv6 are multiprotocol but are simpler devices than routers processing appletalk decnet ip and xerox protocols from the mid1970s and in the 1980s generalpurpose minicomputers served as routers modern highspeed routers are highly specialized computers with extra hardware added to speed both common routing functions such as packet forwarding and specialised functions such as ipsec encryption there is substantial use of linux and unix software based machines running open source routing code for research and other applications the cisco ios operating system was independently designed major router operating systems such as junos and nxos are extensively modified versions of unix software forwardingedit further information routing and ip routing the main purpose of a router is to connect multiple networks and forward packets destined either for its own networks or other networks a router is considered a layer3 device because its primary forwarding decision is based on the information in the layer3 ip packet specifically the destination ip address when a router receives a packet it searches its routing table to find the best match between the destination ip address of the packet and one of the addresses in the routing table once a match is found the packet is encapsulated in the layer2 data link frame for the outgoing interface indicated in the table entry a router typically does not look into the packet payloadcitation needed but only at the layer3 addresses to make a forwarding decision plus optionally other information in the header for hints on for example quality of service qos for pure ip forwarding a router is designed to minimize the state information associated with individual packets27 once a packet is forwarded the router does not retain any historical information about the packetd the routing table itself can contain information derived from a variety of sources such as a default or static routes that are configured manually or dynamic routing protocols where the router learns routes from other routers a default route is one that is used to route all traffic whose destination does not otherwise appear in the routing table this is common – even necessary – in small networks such as a home or small business where the default route simply sends all nonlocal traffic to the internet service provider the default route can be manually configured as a static route or learned by dynamic routing protocols or be obtained by dhcpe28 a router can run more than one routing protocol at a time particularly if it serves as an autonomous system border router between parts of a network that run different routing protocols if it does so then redistribution may be used usually selectively to share information between the different protocols running on the same router29 besides making a decision as to which interface a packet is forwarded to which is handled primarily via the routing table a router also has to manage congestion when packets arrive at a rate higher than the router can process three policies commonly used in the internet are tail drop random early detection red and weighted random early detection wred tail drop is the simplest and most easily implemented the router simply drops new incoming packets once the length of the queue exceeds the size of the buffers in the router red probabilistically drops datagrams early when the queue exceeds a preconfigured portion of the buffer until a predetermined max when it becomes tail drop wred requires a weight on the average queue size to act upon when the traffic is about to exceed the preconfigured size so that short bursts will not trigger random dropscitation needed another function a router performs is to decide which packet should be processed first when multiple queues exist this is managed through qos which is critical when voice over ip is deployed so as not to introduce excessive latencycitation needed yet another function a router performs is called policybased routing where special rules are constructed to override the rules derived from the routing table when a packet forwarding decision is made30 router functions may be performed through the same internal paths that the packets travel inside the router some of the functions may be performed through an applicationspecific integrated circuit asic to avoid overhead of scheduling cpu time to process the packets others may have to be performed through the cpu as these packets need special attention that cannot be handled by an asiccitation needed see alsoedit computer networking portal decbit mobile broadband modem modem residential gateway tcam content addressable memory hardware acceleration of routesearch wireless router notesedit router is pronounced ˈruːtər in british english and is typically pronounced ˈraʊdər american and australian english1 as opposed to a network switch which connects data lines from one single network this particular idea had been previously pioneered in the cyclades network the forwarding action can be collected into the statistical data if so configured a router can serve as a dhcp client or as a dhcp server referencesedit router oxford english dictionary 3rd ed oxford
