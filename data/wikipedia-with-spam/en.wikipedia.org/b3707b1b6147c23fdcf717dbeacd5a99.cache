treated whittaker cruelly while his mother was neurotic3 chambers brother committed suicide shortly after withdrawing from his first year of college chambers would cite his brothers fate as one of many reasons that he was drawn to communism at that time as he wrote communism offered me what nothing else in the dying world had power to offer at the same intensity faith and a vision something for which to live and something for which to die”1 after graduating from south side high school in neighboring rockville centre in 1919 chambers worked itinerantly in washington and new orleans briefly

sophomore year chambers joined the boars head society6 and wrote a play called a play for puppets for columbias literary magazine the morningside which he edited the work was deemed blasphemous by

across america and in many other countries chambers also worked as a translator during this period among his works was the english version of felix saltens 1923 novel bambi a life in the woods10 harold wareedit chambers was recruited to join the communist underground and began his career as a spy working for a gru apparatus headed by alexander ulanovsky aka ulrich later his main controller in the underground was josef peters whom cpusa general secretary earl browder later replaced with rudy baker chambers claimed peters introduced him to harold ware although he later denied he had ever been introduced to ware and that he was head of a communist underground cell in washington that reportedly included11 name description lee pressman assistant general counsel of aaa john abt chief of

intelligence in addition to the ware group mentioned above other sources that chambers dealt with allegedly included12 name description harry dexter white director of division of monetary research at treasury harold glasser assistant director division of monetary research treasury noel field employed at department of state julian wadleigh economist with agriculture later trade agreements section of department of state vincent reno mathematician at us army aberdeen proving ground ward pigman employed at national bureau of standards then labor and public welfare committee break with communismedit juliet stuart poyntz circa 1918 whose disappearance spurred chambers to defect chambers carried on his espionage activities from 1932 until 1937 or 1938 even while his faith in communism was waning he became increasingly disturbed by joseph stalins great purge which began in 1936 he was also fearful for his own life having noted the murder in switzerland of ignace reiss a highranking soviet spy who had broken with stalin and the disappearance of chambers friend and fellow spy juliet stuart poyntz in the united states poyntz had vanished in 1937 shortly after she had visited moscow and returned disillusioned with the communist cause due to the stalinist purges13 chambers ignored several orders that he travel to moscow worried that he might be purged he also started concealing some of the documents he collected from his sources he planned to use these along with several rolls of microfilm photographs of documents as a life preserver to prevent the soviets from killing him and his family1 in 1938 chambers broke with communism and took his family into hiding storing the life preserver at the home of his nephew and his parents initially he had no plans to give information on his espionage activities to the us government his espionage contacts were his friends and he had no desire to inform on them1 in his examination of chambers conversion from the political left to the right author daniel oppenheimer noted that chambers substituted his passion for communism for a passion for god chambers saw the world in black and white terms both before his defection and after in his autobiography he presented his devotion to communism as a reason for living but after defecting saw his actions as being part of an absolute evil 3 berle meetingedit adolf a berle circa 1965 who ignored chambers report in 1939 the august 1939 hitlerstalin nonaggression pact drove chambers to take action against the soviet union14 in september 1939 at the urging of anticommunist russianborn journalist isaac don levine chambers and levine met with assistant secretary of state adolf a berle levine had introduced chambers to walter krivitsky who was already informing american and british authorities about soviet agents who held posts in both governments krivitsky told chambers it was their duty to inform chambers agreed to reveal what he knew on the condition of immunity from prosecution15 during the meeting which took place at berles home woodley mansion in washington chambers named 18 current and former government employees as spies or communist sympathizers many names mentioned held relatively minor posts or were already under suspicion some names however were more significant and surprising alger hiss his brother donald hiss and laurence duggan—who were all respected midlevel officials in the state department—and lauchlin currie a special assistant to franklin roosevelt another person named had worked on a top secret bombsight project at the aberdeen proving groundscitation needed berle found chambers information tentative unclear and uncorroborated he took the information to the white house but the president dismissed it to which berle made little if any objection berle kept his notes however later evidence during hiss perjury trials16 berle notified the federal bureau of investigation fbi of chamberss information in march 1940 in february 1941 krivitsky was found dead in his hotel room while police ruled the death a suicide it was widely speculated that krivitsky had been killed by soviet intelligence worried that the soviets might try to kill chambers too berle again told the fbi about his interview with chambers nevertheless the fbi took no immediate action in line with the political orientation of the united states which viewed the potential threat from the ussr as minor when compared to that of nazi germanycitation needed the fbi did interview chambers in may 1942 and june 1945 without further action only in november 1945 when elizabeth bentley defected and corroborated much of chamberss story did the fbi begin to take chambers seriously17 time magazineedit henry luce with wife clare boothe luce circa 1954 both of whom valued chambers writings by the time of the berle meeting chambers had come out of hiding after a year and joined the staff of time magazine april 1939 he landed a cover story within a month on james joyces latest book finnegans wake18 he started at the back of the magazine reviewing books and film with james agee and then calvin fixx when fixx suffered a heart attack in october 1942 wilder hobson succeeded him as chambers assistant editor in arts entertainment other writers working for chambers in that section included novelist nigel dennis future new york times book review editor harvey breit and poets howard moss and weldon kees1920 during this time a struggle arose between those like theodore h white and richard lauterbach who raised criticism of what they saw as the elitism corruption and ineptitude of chiang kaisheks regime in china and advocated greater cooperation with maos red army in the struggle against japanese imperialism and chambers and others like willi schlamm who adhered to a staunchly prochiang anticommunist perspective and who both later joined the founding editorial board of william f buckley jrs national review time founder henry luce who grew up in china and was a personal friend of chiang and his wife came down squarely on the side of chambers to the point that white complained that his stories were being censored and even suppressed in their entirety and left time shortly after the war as a result21 in 1940 william saroyan lists fixx among contributing editors at time in saroyans play loves old sweet song22 luce promoted him senior editor in either summer 1942 weinstein23 or september 1943 tanenhaus24 and became a member of times senior group which determined editorial policy in december 194324 chambers close colleagues and many staff members as of the 1930s helped elevate time–interstitial intellectuals as historian robert vanderlan has called them25 colleague john hersey described them as follows time was in an interesting phase an editor named tom matthews had gathered a brilliant group of writers including james agee robert fitzgerald whittaker chambers robert cantwell louis kronenberger and calvin fixx they were dazzling time’s style was still very hokey—“backward ran sentences till reeled the mind”—but i could tell even as a neophyte who had written each of the pieces in the magazine because each of these writers had such a distinctive voice26 by early 1948 chambers had become one of the best known writereditors at time first had come his scathing commentary the ghosts on the roof march 5 1945 on the yalta conference in which hiss partook subsequent coverstory essays profiled marian anderson arnold j toynbee rebecca west and reinhold niebuhr the cover story on marian anderson religion in egypt land december 30 1946 proved so popular that the magazine broke its rule of nonattribution in response to readers letters most time cover stories are written and edited by the regular staffs of the section in which they appear certain cover stories that present special difficulties or call for a special literary skill are written by senior editor whittaker chambers27 in a 1945 letter to time colleague charles wertenbaker timelife deputy editorial director john shaw billings said of chambers whit puts on the best show in words of any writer weve ever had a superb technician particularly skilled in the mosaic art of putting a time section together28 chambers was at the height of his career when the hiss case broke later that year29 during this period chambers and his family became quakers attending pipe creek friends meetinghouse near his maryland farm30 the hiss caseedit alger hiss 1948 who fiercely denied chambers allegations and was convicted of perjury on august 3 1948 chambers was called to testify before the house unamerican activities committee huac here he gave the names of individuals he said were part of the underground ware group in the late 1930s including alger hiss he thus once again named hiss as a member of the communist party but did not yet make any accusations of espionage in subsequent huac sessions hiss testified and initially denied that he knew anyone by the name of chambers but on seeing him in person and after it became clear that chambers knew details about hisss life said that he had known chambers under the name george crosley hiss denied that he had ever been a communist however since chambers still presented no evidence the committee had initially been inclined to take the word of hiss on the matter however committee member richard nixon received secret information from the fbi which had led him to pursue the issue when it issued its report huac described hisss testimony as vague and evasivecitation needed red herringedit harry s truman center with joseph stalin left and winston churchill right in 1945 called chambers allegations a red herring the country quickly became divided over the hiss–chambers issue president harry s truman not pleased with the allegation that the man who had presided over the united nations charter conference was a communist dismissed the case as a red herring31 in the atmosphere of increasing anticommunism that would later be termed mccarthyism many conservatives viewed the hiss case as emblematic of what they saw as democrats laxity towards the danger of communist infiltration and influence in the state department many liberals in turn saw the hiss case as part of the desperation of the republican party to regain the office of president having been out of power for 16 years truman also issued executive order 9835 which initiated a program of loyalty reviews for federal employees in 1947citation needed pumpkin papersedit foley square in 2014 in nyc site of grand jury and trials of hiss case hiss filed a 75000 libel suit against chambers on october 8 1948 under pressure from hisss lawyers chambers finally retrieved his envelope of evidence and presented it to the huac after they subpoenaed them it contained four notes in alger hisss handwriting sixtyfive typewritten copies of state department documents and five strips of microfilm some of which contained photographs of state department documents the press came to call these the pumpkin papers referring to the fact that chambers had briefly hidden the microfilm in a hollowedout pumpkin these documents indicated that hiss knew chambers long after mid1936 when hiss said he had last seen crosley and also that hiss had engaged in espionage with chambers chambers explained his delay in producing this evidence as an effort to spare an old friend from more trouble than necessary until october 1948 chambers had repeatedly stated that hiss had not engaged in espionage even when chambers testified under oath chambers was forced to testify at the hiss trials that he had committed perjury several times which reduced his credibility in the eyes of his criticscitation needed the five rolls of 35 mm film known as the pumpkin papers were thought until late 1974 to be locked in huac files independent researcher stephen w salant an economist at the university of michigan sued the us justice department in 1975 when his request for access to them under the freedom of information act was denied on july 31 1975 as a result of this lawsuit and followon suits filed by peter irons and by alger hiss and william reuben the justice department released copies of the pumpkin papers that had been used to implicate hiss one roll of film turned out to be totally blank due to overexposure two others are faintly legible copies of nonclassified navy department documents relating to such subjects as life rafts and fire extinguishers and the remaining two are photographs of the state department documents introduced by the prosecution at the two hiss trials relating to usgerman relations in the late 1930s32 this story however as reported by the new york times in the 1970s contains only a partial truth the blank roll had been mentioned by chambers in his autobiography witness but in addition to innocuous farm reports etc the documents on the other pumpkin patch microfilms also included confidential memos sent from overseas embassies to diplomatic staff in washington dc33 worse those memos had originally been transmitted in code which thanks to their presumably having both coded originals and the translations forwarded by hiss the soviets now could easily understand33 perjuryedit hiss could not be tried for espionage at this time because the evidence indicated the offense had occurred more than ten years prior to that time and the statute of limitations for espionage was five years instead hiss was indicted for two counts of perjury relating to testimony he had given before a federal grand jury the previous december there he had denied giving any documents to whittaker chambers and testified he had not seen chambers after mid1936citation needed hiss was tried twice for perjury the first trial in june 1949 ended with the jury deadlocked eight to four for conviction in addition to chamberss testimony a government expert testified that other papers typed on a typewriter belonging to the hiss family matched the secret papers produced by chambers an impressive array of character witnesses appeared on behalf of hiss two us supreme court justices felix frankfurter and stanley reed former democratic presidential nominee john w davis and future democratic presidential nominee adlai stevenson chambers on the other hand was attacked by hisss attorneys as an enemy of the republic a blasphemer of christ a disbeliever in god with no respect for matrimony or motherhood31 in the second trial hisss defense produced a psychiatrist who characterized chambers as a psychopathic personality and a pathological liar34 the second trial ended in january 1950 with hiss found guilty on both counts of perjury he was sentenced to five years in prisoncitation needed after the hiss caseedit chambers had resigned from time in december 19481 after the hiss case he wrote a few articles for fortune life and look magazinescitation needed witnessedit in 1952 chamberss book witness was published to widespread acclaim35363738 the book was a combination of autobiography and a warning about the dangers of communism arthur schlesinger jr called it a powerful book39 ronald reagan credited the book as the inspiration behind his conversion from a new deal democrat to a conservative republican31 witness was a bestseller for more than a year39 and helped pay off chambers legal debts though bills lingered as odysseus was beset by a ghost40 according to conservative commentator george will in 2017 witness became a canonical text of conservatism unfortunately it injected conservatism with a sour whiney complaining crybaby populism it is the screechy and dominant tone of the loutish faux conservatism that today is erasing william f buckley’s legacy of infectious cheerfulness and unapologetic embrace of high culture chambers wallowed in cloying sentimentality and curdled resentment about “the plain men and women” — “my people humble people strong in common sense in common goodness” — enduring the “musk of snobbism” emanating from the “socially formidable circles” of the “nicest people” produced by “certain collegiate eyries”41 national reviewedit william f buckley jr right l brent bozell jr left in 1954 first asked chambers to endorse their book on mccarthy in 1955 william f buckley jr started the magazine national review and chambers worked there as senior editor publishing articles there for a little over a year and a half october 1957–june 195942 the most widely cited article to date4344454647 is a scathing review big sister is watching you of ayn rands atlas shrugged484950 in 1959 after resigning from national review chambers and his wife visited europe the highlight of which was a meeting with

deathedit a farm in carroll county maryland like the pipe creek farm where chambers took refuge in 1938 and lived until he died in 1930 or 193152 chambers married the artist esther shemitz 1900–19861 53 shemitz who had studied at the art students league and integrated herself into new york citys intellectual circles met chambers at the 1926 textile strike at passaic new jersey they then underwent a stormy courtship that faced resistance from their comrades with chambers having climbed through her window at five oclock in the morning to propose shemitz identified as a pacifist rather than a revolutionary54 in the 1920s she worked for the world tomorrow a pacifist magazine1 the couple had two children ellen and john during the 1930s communist leadership expected couples to go childless but like many chambers refused a choice he cited as part of his gradual disillusionment with communism1 in 1978 allen weinsteins perjury revealed that fbi has a copy of a letter in which chambers described homosexual liaisons during the 1930s55 the letter copy states that chambers gave up these practices in 1938 when he left the underground attributed to newfound christianity56 the letter has remained controversial from many perspectives57 chambers died of a heart attack on july 9 1961 at his 300acre 12 km2 farm in westminster maryland5859 he had suffered from angina since the age of 38 and had previously suffered several heart attacks1 cold friday his second memoir was published posthumously in 1964 with the help of duncan nortontaylor the book prophetically predicted that the fall
