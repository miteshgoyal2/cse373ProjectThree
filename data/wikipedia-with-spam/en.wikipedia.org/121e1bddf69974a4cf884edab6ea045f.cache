deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers4 in the history of the united states with 343 and 72 killed respectively suspicion quickly fell on alqaeda the united states responded by launching the war on terror and invading afghanistan to depose the taliban which had harbored alqaeda many countries strengthened their antiterrorism legislation and expanded the powers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks although alqaedas leader osama bin laden initially denied any involvement in 2004 he claimed responsibility for the attacks1 alqaeda and bin laden cited us support of israel the presence of us troops in saudi arabia and sanctions against iraq as motives after evading capture for almost a decade osama bin laden was located and killed by seal team six of the us navy in may 2011 the destruction of the world trade center and nearby infrastructure caused serious damage to the economy of lower manhattan and had a significant effect on global markets resulting in the closing of wall street until september 17 and the civilian airspace in the us and canada until september 13 many closings evacuations and cancellations

wanat camp chapman attack pune in amenas hostage crisis further information alqaeda and jihad the origins of alqaeda can be traced to 1979 when the soviet union invaded afghanistan osama bin laden traveled to afghanistan and helped organize arab mujahideen to resist the soviets7 under the guidance of ayman alzawahiri bin laden became more radical8 in 1996 bin laden issued his first fatwā calling for american soldiers to leave saudi arabia9 in a second fatwā in 1998 bin laden outlined his objections to american foreign policy with respect to israel as well as the continued presence of american troops in saudi arabia after the gulf war10 bin laden used islamic texts to exhort muslims to attack americans until the stated grievances are reversed muslim legal scholars have throughout islamic history unanimously agreed that the jihad is an individual duty if the enemy destroys the muslim countries according to bin laden10 osama bin laden further information osama bin laden death of osama bin laden and videos of osama bin laden 1997 photograph of osama bin laden bin laden who orchestrated the attacks initially denied but later admitted involvement11112 al jazeera broadcast a statement by bin laden on september 16 2001 stating i stress that i have not carried out this act which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation13 in november 2001 us forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in jalalabad afghanistan in the video bin laden is seen talking to khaled alharbi and admits foreknowledge of the attacks14 on december 27 2001 a second bin laden video was released in the video he said it has become clear that the west in general and america in particular have an unspeakable hatred for islam it is the hatred of crusaders terrorism against america deserves to be praised because it was a response to injustice aimed at forcing america to stop its support for israel which kills our people we say that the end of the united states is imminent whether bin laden or his followers are alive or dead for the awakening of the muslim umma nation has occurred but he stopped short of admitting responsibility for the attacks15 the transcript refers several times to the united states specifically targeting muslims shortly before the us presidential election in 2004 in a taped statement bin laden publicly acknowledged alqaedas involvement in the attacks on the us and admitted his direct link to the attacks he said that the attacks were carried out because we are free  and want to regain freedom for our nation as you undermine our security we undermine yours16 bin laden said he had personally directed his followers to attack the world trade center and the pentagon1217 another video obtained by al jazeera in september 2006 shows bin laden with ramzi bin alshibh as well as two hijackers hamza alghamdi and wail alshehri as they make preparations for the attacks18 the us never formally indicted bin laden for the 911 attacks but he was on the fbis most wanted list for the bombings of the us embassies in dar es salaam tanzania and nairobi kenya1920 after a 10year manhunt bin laden was killed by american special forces in a compound in abbottabad pakistan on may 2 20112122 khalid sheikh mohammed main article khalid sheikh mohammed khalid sheikh mohammed after his capture in 2003 the journalist yosri fouda of the arabic television channel al jazeera reported that in april 2002 khalid sheikh mohammed admitted his involvement along with ramzi bin alshibh232425 the 911 commission report determined that the animosity towards the united states felt by mohammed the principal architect of the 911 attacks stemmed from his violent disagreement with us foreign policy favoring israel26 mohammed was also an adviser and financier of the 1993 world trade center bombing and the uncle of ramzi yousef the lead bomber in that attack2728 mohammed was arrested on march 1 2003 in rawalpindi pakistan by pakistani security officials working with the cia he was then held at multiple cia secret prisons and guantanamo bay where he was interrogated and tortured with methods including waterboarding293031 during us hearings at guantanamo bay in march 2007 mohammed again confessed his responsibility for the attacks stating he was responsible for the 911 operation from a to z and that his statement was not made under duress2532 other alqaeda members further information trials related to the september 11 attacks in substitution for testimony of khalid sheikh mohammed from the trial of zacarias moussaoui five people are identified as having been completely aware of the operations details they are bin laden khalid sheikh mohammed ramzi bin alshibh abu turab alurduni and mohammed atef33 to date only peripheral figures have been tried or convicted for the attacks on september 26 2005 the spanish high court sentenced abu dahdah to 27 years in prison for conspiracy on the 911 attacks and being a member of the terrorist organization alqaeda at the same time another 17 alqaeda members were sentenced to penalties of between six and eleven years34 on february 16 2006 the spanish supreme court reduced the abu dahdah penalty to 12 years because it considered that his participation in the conspiracy was not proven35 also in 2006 moussaoui who some originally suspected might have been the assigned 20th hijacker was convicted for the lesser role of conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism and air piracy he is serving a life sentence without parole in the united states3637 mounir elmotassadeq an associate of the hamburgbased hijackers is serving 15 years in germany for his role in helping the hijackers prepare for the attacks38 the hamburg cell in germany included radical islamists who eventually came to be key operatives in the 911 attacks39 mohamed atta marwan alshehhi ziad jarrah ramzi bin alshibh and said bahaji were all members of alqaedas hamburg cell40 motives main article motives for the september 11 attacks osama bin ladens declaration of a holy war against the united states and a 1998 fatwā signed by bin laden and others calling for the killing of americans10 are seen by investigators as evidence of his motivation41 in bin ladens november 2002 letter to america he explicitly stated that alqaedas motives for their attacks include us support of israel4243 support for the attacks against muslims in somalia support of philippines against muslims in the moro conflict support for israeli aggression against muslims in lebanon support of russian atrocities against muslims in chechnya proamerican governments in the middle east who act as your agents being against muslim interests support of indian oppression against muslims in kashmir the presence of us troops in saudi arabia4445 the sanctions against iraq46 after the attacks bin laden and alzawahiri released additional video tapes and audio tapes some of which repeated those reasons for the attacks two particularly important publications were bin ladens 2002 letter to america47 and a 2004 video tape by bin laden48 bin laden interpreted muhammad as having banned the permanent presence of infidels in arabia49 in 1996 bin laden issued a fatwā calling for american troops to leave saudi arabia in 1998 alqaeda wrote for over seven years the united states has been occupying the lands of islam in the holiest of places the arabian peninsula plundering its riches dictating to its rulers humiliating its people terrorizing its neighbors and turning its bases in the peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the neighboring muslim peoples50 in a december 1999 interview bin laden said he felt that americans were too near to mecca and considered this a provocation to the entire muslim world51 one analysis of suicide terrorism suggested that without us troops in saudi arabia alqaeda likely would not have been able to get people to commit to suicide missions52 in the 1998 fatwā alqaeda identified the iraq sanctions as a reason to kill americans condemning the protracted blockade50 among other actions that constitute a declaration of war against allah his messenger and muslims50 the fatwā declared that the ruling to kill the americans and their allies – civilians and military – is an individual duty for every muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it in order to liberate the alaqsa mosque and the holy mosque of mecca from their grip and in order for their the americans armies to move out of all the lands of islam defeated and unable to threaten any muslim1053 bin laden claimed in 2004 that the idea of destroying the towers had first occurred to him in 1982 when he witnessed israels bombardment of highrise apartment buildings during the 1982 lebanon war5455 some analysts including mearsheimer and walt also claim that one motivation for the attacks was us support of israel4351 in 2004 and 2010 bin laden again connected the september 11 attacks with us support of israel although most of the letter expressed bin ladens disdain for president bush and bin ladens hope to destroy and bankrupt the us5657 other motives have been suggested in addition to those stated by bin laden and alqaeda including western support of islamic and nonislamic authoritarian regimes in saudi arabia iran egypt iraq pakistan and northern africa and the presence of western troops in some of these countries58page needed some authors suggest the humiliation resulting from the islamic world falling behind the western world – this discrepancy rendered especially visible by the globalization trend5960 and a desire to provoke the us into a broader war against the islamic world in the hope of motivating more allies to support alqaeda similarly others have argued that 911 was a strategic move with the objective of provoking america into a war that would incite a panislamic revolution6162 planning main article planning of the september 11 attacks map showing the attacks on the world trade center the planes are not drawn to scale the idea for the attacks came from khalid sheikh mohammed who first presented it to osama bin laden in 199663 at that time bin laden and alqaeda were in a period of transition having just relocated back to afghanistan from sudan64 the 1998 african embassy bombings and bin ladens 1998 fatwā marked a turning point as bin laden became intent on attacking the united states64 in late 1998 or early 1999 bin laden gave approval for mohammed to go forward with organizing the plot a series of meetings occurred in early 1999 involving mohammed bin laden and his deputy mohammed atef64 atef provided operational support for the plot including target selections and helping arrange travel for the hijackers64 bin laden overruled mohammed rejecting some potential targets such as the us bank tower in los angeles because there was not enough time to prepare for such an operation6566 diagram showing the attacks on the world trade center bin laden provided leadership and financial support for the plot and was involved in selecting participants67 bin laden initially selected nawaf alhazmi and khalid almihdhar both experienced jihadists who had fought in bosnia hazmi and mihdhar arrived in the united states in midjanuary 2000 in spring 2000 hazmi and mihdhar took flying lessons in san diego california but both spoke little english performed poorly with flying lessons and eventually served as secondary – or muscle – hijackers6869 in late 1999 a group of men from hamburg germany arrived in afghanistan including mohamed atta marwan alshehhi ziad jarrah and ramzi bin alshibh70 bin laden selected these men because they were educated could speak english and had experience living in the west71 new recruits were routinely screened for special skills and alqaeda leaders consequently discovered that hani hanjour already had a commercial pilots license72 mohammed later said that he helped the hijackers blend in by teaching them how to order food in restaurants and dress in western clothing73 hanjour arrived in san diego on december 8 2000 joining hazmi746–7 they soon left for arizona where hanjour took refresher training747 marwan alshehhi arrived at the end of may 2000 while atta arrived on june 3 2000 and jarrah arrived on june 27 2000746 bin alshibh applied several times for a visa to the united states but as a yemeni he was rejected out of concerns he would overstay his visa and remain as an illegal immigrant744 14 bin alshibh stayed in hamburg providing coordination between atta and mohammed7416 the three hamburg cell members all took pilot training in south florida746 in spring of 2001 the secondary hijackers began arriving in the united states75 in july 2001 atta met with bin alshibh in spain where they coordinated details of the plot including final target selection bin alshibh also passed along bin ladens wish for the attacks to be carried out as soon as possible76 some of the hijackers received passports from corrupt saudi officials who were family members or used fraudulent passports to gain entry77 prior intelligence in late 1999 alqaeda associate walid bin attash khallad contacted mihdhar telling him to meet him in kuala lumpur malaysia hazmi and abu bara al yemeni would also be in attendance the nsa intercepted a telephone call mentioning the meeting mihdhar and the name nawaf hazmi while the agency feared that something nefarious might be afoot it took no further action the cia had already been alerted by saudi intelligence to the status of mihdhar and hazmi as alqaeda members and a cia team broke into mihdhars dubai hotel room and discovered that mihdhar had a us visa while alec station alerted intelligence agencies worldwide about this fact it did not share this information with the fbi the malaysian special branch observed the january 5 2000 meeting of the two alqaeda members and informed the cia that mihdhar hazmi and khallad were flying to bangkok but the cia never notified other agencies of this nor did it ask the state department to put mihdhar on its watchlist an fbi liaison to alec station asked permission to inform the fbi of the meeting but was told that this is not a matter for the fbi78 by late june senior counterterrorism official richard clarke and cia director george tenet were convinced that a major series of attacks was about to come although the cia believed that the attacks would likely occur in saudi arabia or israel79 in early july clarke put domestic agencies on full alert telling them that something really spectacular is going to happen here soon he asked the fbi and the state department to alert the embassies and police departments and the defense department to go to threat condition delta8081 clarke would later write that somewhere in cia there was information that two known al qaeda terrorists had come into the united states in the fbi there was information that strange things had been going on at flight schools in the united states they had specific information about individual terrorists none of that information got to me or the white house82 on july 13 tom wilshire a cia agent assigned to the fbis international terrorism division emailed his superiors at the cias counterterrorism center ctc requesting permission to inform the fbi that hazmi was in the country and that mihdhar had a us visa the cia never responded83 the same day in july margarette gillespie an fbi analyst working in the ctc was told to review material about the malaysia meeting she was not told of the participants presence in the us the cia gave gillespie surveillance photos of mihdhar and hazmi from the meeting to show to fbi counterterrorism but did not tell her their significance the intelink database informed her not to share intelligence material on the meeting to criminal investigators when shown the photos the fbi were refused more details on their significance and also did not receive mihdhars date of birth or passport number84 in late august 2001 gillespie told the ins the state department the customs service and the fbi to put hazmi and mihdhar on their watchlists but the fbi was prohibited from using criminal agents in the search for the duo which hindered their efforts85 also in july a phoenixbased fbi agent sent a message to fbi headquarters alec station and to fbi agents in new york alerting them to the possibility of a coordinated effort by osama bin laden to send students to the united states to attend civil aviation universities and colleges the agent kenneth williams suggested the need to interview all flight school managers and identify all arab students seeking flight training86 in july jordan alerted the us that alqaeda was planning an attack on the us months later jordan notified the us that the attacks codename was the big wedding and that it involved airplanes87 on august 6 the cias presidential daily brief designated for the president only was entitled bin ladin determined to strike in us the memo noted that the fbi information indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks88 in midaugust one minnesota flight school alerted the fbi to zacarias moussaoui who had asked suspicious questions the fbi found that he was a radical who had traveled to pakistan and the ins arrested him for overstaying his french visa their request to search his laptop was denied by fbi headquarters due to the lack of probable cause89 the failures in intelligencesharing were attributed to 1995 justice department policies limiting intelligence sharing combined with cia and nsa reluctance in revealing sensitive sources and methods such as tapped phones90 testifying before the 911 commission in april 2004 thenattorney general john ashcroft recalled that the single greatest structural cause for the september 11th problem was the wall that segregated or separated criminal investigators and intelligence agents91 clarke also wrote that there were failures in the organizations failures to get information to the right place at the right time92 attacks further information timeline for the day of the september 11 attacks flight paths of the four planes used on september 11 early on the morning of september 11 2001 19 hijackers

hijacker and pilot of flight 11 thought the white house might be too tough a target and sought an assessment from hani hanjour who hijacked and piloted flight 77116 mohammed said alqaeda initially

immediate response to the attacks336 on july 22 2004 the commission issued the 911 commission report the report detailed the events of 911 found the attacks were carried out by members of alqaeda and examined how security and intelligence agencies were inadequately coordinated to prevent the attacks formed from an independent bipartisan group of mostly former senators representatives and governors the commissioners explained we believe the 911 attacks revealed four kinds of failures in imagination policy capabilities and management337 the commission made numerous recommendations on how to prevent future attacks and in 2011 was dismayed that several of its recommendations had yet to be implemented338 national institute of standards and technology see also 7 world trade center § 911 and collapse the exterior support columns from the lower level of the south tower remained standing after the building collapsed the us national institute of standards and technology nist investigated the collapses of the twin towers and 7 wtc the investigations examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures were in place and evaluated how fire protection systems might be improved in future construction339 the investigation into the collapse of 1 wtc and 2 wtc was concluded in october 2005 and that of 7 wtc was completed in august 2008340 nist found that the fireproofing on the twin towers steel infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that had this not occurred the towers likely would have remained standing341 a 2007 study of the north towers collapse published by researchers of purdue university determined that since the planes impact had stripped off much of the structures thermal insulation the heat from a typical office fire would have softened and weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to initiate the collapse regardless of the number of columns cut or damaged by the impact342343 the director of the original investigation stated that the towers really did amazingly well the terrorist aircraft didnt bring the buildings down it was the fire which followed it was proven that you could take out two thirds of the columns in a tower and the building would still stand344 the fires weakened the trusses supporting the floors making the floors sag the sagging floors pulled on the exterior steel columns causing the exterior columns to bow inward with the damage to the core columns the buckling exterior columns could no longer support the buildings causing them to collapse additionally the
