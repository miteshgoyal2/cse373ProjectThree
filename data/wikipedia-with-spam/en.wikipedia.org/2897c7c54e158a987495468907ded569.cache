intelligence the nsa is responsible for global monitoring collection and processing of information and data for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes specializing in a discipline known as signals intelligence sigint the nsa is also tasked with the protection of us communications networks and information systems89 the nsa relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission the majority of which are clandestine10 originating as a unit to decipher coded communications in world war ii it was officially formed as the nsa by president harry s truman in 1952 since then it has become one of the largest us intelligence organizations in terms of personnel and budget611 the nsa currently conducts worldwide mass data collection and has been known to physically bug electronic systems as one method to this end12 the nsa has also been alleged to have been behind such attack software as stuxnet which severely damaged irans nuclear program1314 the nsa alongside cia maintains a physical presence in many countries across the globe the ciansa joint special collection service a highly classified intelligence team inserts eavesdropping devices in high value targets such as presidential palaces or embassies scs collection tactics allegedly encompass close surveillance burglary wiretapping and breaking and entering1516 unlike the defense intelligence agency dia and the central intelligence agency cia both of which specialize primarily in foreign human espionage the nsa does not publicly conduct humansource intelligence gathering the nsa is entrusted with providing assistance to and the coordination of sigint elements for other government organizations which are prevented by law from engaging in such activities on their own17 as part of these responsibilities the agency has a colocated organization called the central security service css which facilitates cooperation between the nsa and other us defense cryptanalysis components to further ensure streamlined communication between the signals intelligence community divisions the nsa director simultaneously serves as the commander of the united states cyber command and as chief of the central security service the nsas actions have been a matter of political controversy on several occasions including its spying on antivietnamwar leaders and the agencys participation in economic espionage in 2013 the nsa had many of its secret surveillance programs revealed to the public by edward snowden a former nsa contractor according to the leaked documents the nsa intercepts and stores the communications of over a billion people worldwide including united states citizens the documents also revealed the nsa tracks hundreds of millions of peoples movements using cellphones metadata

historyedit formationedit the origins of the national security agency can be traced back to april 28 1917 three weeks after the us congress declared war on germany in world war i a code and cipher decryption unit was established as the cable and telegraph section which was also known as the cipher bureau it was headquartered in washington dc and was part of the war effort under the executive branch without direct congressional authorization during the course of the war it was relocated in the armys organizational chart several times on july 5 1917 herbert o yardley was assigned to head the unit at that point the unit consisted of yardley and two civilian clerks it absorbed the navys cryptanalysis functions in july 1918 world war i ended on november 11 1918 and the army cryptographic section of military intelligence mi8 moved to new york city on may 20 1919 where it continued intelligence activities as the code compilation company under the direction of yardley1920 the black chamberedit main article black chamber black chamber cryptanalytic work sheet for solving japanese diplomatic cipher 1919 after the disbandment of the us army cryptographic section of military intelligence known as mi8 in 1919 the us government created the cipher bureau also known as black chamber the black chamber was the united states first peacetime cryptanalytic organization21 jointly funded by the army and the state department the cipher bureau was disguised as a new york city commercial code company it actually produced and sold such codes for business use its true mission however was to break the communications chiefly diplomatic of other nations its most notable known success was at the washington naval conference during which it aided american negotiators considerably by providing them with the decrypted traffic of many of the conference delegations most notably the japanese the black chamber successfully persuaded western union the largest us telegram company at the time as well as several other communications companies to illegally give the black chamber access to cable traffic of foreign embassies and consulates22 soon these companies publicly discontinued their collaboration despite the chambers initial successes it was shut down in 1929 by us secretary of state henry l stimson who defended his decision by stating gentlemen do not read each others mail23 world war ii and its aftermathedit during world war ii the signal security agency ssa was created to intercept and decipher the communications of the axis powers24 when the war ended the ssa was reorganized as the army security agency asa and it was placed under the leadership of the director of military intelligence24 on may 20 1949 all cryptologic activities were centralized under a national organization called the armed forces security agency afsa24 this organization was originally established within the us department of defense under the command of the joint chiefs of staff25 the afsa was tasked to direct department of defense communications and electronic intelligence activities except those of us military intelligence units25 however the afsa was unable to centralize communications intelligence and failed to coordinate with civilian agencies that shared its interests such as the department of state central intelligence agency cia and the federal bureau of investigation fbi25 in december 1951 president harry s truman ordered a panel to investigate how afsa had failed to achieve its goals the results of the investigation led to improvements and its redesignation as the national security agency26 the agency was formally established by truman in a memorandum of october 24 1952 that revised national security council intelligence directive nscid 927 since president trumans memo was a classified document27 the existence of the nsa was not known to the public at that time due to its ultrasecrecy the us intelligence community referred to the nsa as no such agency28 vietnam waredit main articles project minaret and nestor encryption in the 1960s the nsa played a key role in expanding americas commitment to the vietnam war by providing evidence of a north vietnamese attack on the american destroyer uss maddox during the gulf of tonkin incident29 a secret operation codenamed minaret was set up by the nsa to monitor the phone communications of senators frank church and howard baker as well as major civil rights leaders including martin luther king jr and prominent us journalists and athletes who criticized the vietnam war30 however the project turned out to be controversial and an internal review by the nsa concluded that its minaret program was disreputable if not outright illegal30 the nsa mounted a major effort to secure tactical communications among us forces during the war with mixed success the nestor family of compatible secure voice systems it developed was widely deployed during the vietnam war with about 30000 nestor sets produced however a variety of technical and operational problems limited their use allowing the north vietnamese to exploit and intercept us communications31 vol i p79 church committee hearingsedit further information watergate scandal and church committee in the aftermath of the watergate scandal a congressional hearing in 1975 led by sen frank church32 revealed that the nsa in collaboration with britains sigint intelligence agency government communications headquarters gchq had routinely intercepted the international communications of prominent antivietnam war leaders such as jane fonda and dr benjamin spock33 following the resignation of president richard nixon there were several investigations of suspected misuse of fbi cia and nsa facilities34 senator frank church uncovered previously unknown activity34 such as a cia plot ordered by the administration of president john f kennedy to assassinate fidel castro35 the investigation also uncovered nsas wiretaps on targeted american citizens36 after the church committee hearings the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 was passed into law this was designed to limit the practice of mass surveillance in the united states34 from 1980s to 1990sedit in 1986 the nsa intercepted the communications of the libyan government during the immediate aftermath of the berlin discotheque bombing the white house asserted that the nsa interception had provided irrefutable evidence that libya was behind the bombing which us president ronald reagan cited as a justification for the 1986 united states bombing of libya3738 in 1999 a multiyear investigation by the european parliament highlighted the nsas role in economic espionage in a report entitled development of surveillance technology and risk of abuse of economic information39 that year the nsa founded the nsa hall of honor a memorial at the national cryptologic museum in fort meade maryland40 the memorial is a tribute to the pioneers and heroes who have made significant and longlasting contributions to american cryptology40 nsa employees must be retired for more than fifteen years to qualify for the memorial40 nsas infrastructure deteriorated in the 1990s as defense budget cuts resulted in maintenance deferrals on january 24 2000 nsa headquarters suffered a total network outage for three days caused by an overloaded network incoming traffic was successfully stored on agency servers but it could not be directed and processed the agency carried out emergency repairs at a cost of 3 million to get the system running again some incoming traffic was also directed instead to britains gchq for the time being director michael hayden called the outage a wakeup call for the need to invest in the agencys infrastructure41 war on terroredit in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks the nsa created new it systems to deal with the flood of information from new technologies like the internet and cellphones thinthread contained advanced data mining capabilities it also had a privacy mechanism surveillance was stored encrypted decryption required a warrant the research done under this program may have contributed to the technology used in later systems thinthread was cancelled when michael hayden chose trailblazer which did not include thinthreads privacy system42 trailblazer project ramped up in 2002 and was worked on by science applications international corporation saic boeing computer sciences corporation ibm and litton industries some nsa whistleblowers complained internally about major problems surrounding trailblazer this led to investigations by congress and the nsa and dod inspectors general the project was cancelled in early 2004 turbulence started in 2005 it was developed in small inexpensive test pieces rather than one grand plan like trailblazer it also included offensive cyberwarfare capabilities like injecting malware into remote computers congress criticized turbulence in 2007 for having similar bureaucratic problems as trailblazer43 it was to be a realization of information processing at higher speeds in cyberspace44 global surveillance disclosuresedit main article global

controversy and litigationedit main article mass surveillance in the united states in the united states at least since 200153 there has been legal controversy over what signal intelligence can be used for and how much freedom the national security agency has to use signal intelligence54 the government has made in 2015 slight changes in how it uses and collects certain types of data55 specifically phone records warrantless wiretapsedit main article nsa warrantless surveillance 2001–07 on december 16 2005 the new york times reported that under white house pressure and with an executive order from president george w bush the national security agency in an attempt to thwart terrorism had been tapping phone calls made to persons outside the country without obtaining warrants from the united states foreign intelligence surveillance court a secret court created for that purpose under the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa56 one such surveillance program authorized by the us signals intelligence directive 18 of president george bush was the highlander project undertaken for the national security agency by the us army 513th military intelligence brigade nsa relayed telephone including cell phone conversations obtained from ground airborne and satellite monitoring stations to various us army signal intelligence officers including the 201st military intelligence battalion conversations of citizens of the us were intercepted along with those of other nations57 proponents of the surveillance program claim that the president has executive authority to order such action arguing that laws such as fisa are overridden by the presidents constitutional powers in addition some argued that fisa was implicitly overridden by a subsequent statute the authorization for use of military force although the supreme courts ruling in hamdan v rumsfeld deprecates this view in the august 2006 case aclu v nsa us district court judge anna diggs taylor concluded that nsas warrantless surveillance program was both illegal and unconstitutional on july 6 2007 the 6th circuit court of appeals vacated the decision on the grounds that the aclu lacked standing to bring the suit58 on january 17 2006 the center for constitutional rights filed a lawsuit ccr v bush against the george w bush presidency the lawsuit challenged the national security agencys nsas surveillance of people within the us including the interception of ccr emails without securing a warrant first5960 in september 2008 the electronic frontier foundation eff filed a class action lawsuit against the nsa and several highranking officials of the bush administration61 charging an illegal and unconstitutional program of dragnet communications surveillance62 based on documentation provided by former att technician mark klein63 as a result of the usa freedom act passed by congress in june 2015 the nsa had to shut down its bulk phone surveillance program on november 29 of the same year the usa freedom act forbids the nsa to collect metadata and content of phone calls unless it has a warrant for terrorism investigation in that case the agency has to ask the telecom companies for the record which will only be kept for six months att internet monitoringedit further information hepting v att jewel v nsa mark klein and nsa warrantless surveillance controversy in may 2006 mark klein a former att employee alleged that his company had cooperated with nsa in installing narus hardware to replace the fbi carnivore program to monitor network communications including traffic between american citizens64 data miningedit nsa was reported in 2008 to use its computing capability to analyze transactional data that it regularly acquires from other government agencies which gather it under their own jurisdictional authorities as part of this effort nsa now monitors huge volumes of records of domestic email data web addresses from internet searches bank transfers creditcard transactions travel records and telephone data according to current and former intelligence officials interviewed by the wall street journal the sender recipient and subject line of emails can be included but the content of the messages or of phone calls are not65 a 2013 advisory group for the obama administration seeking to reform nsa spying programs following the revelations of documents released by edward j snowden66 mentioned in recommendation 30 on page 37 that the national security council staff should manage an interagency process to review on a regular basis the activities of the us government regarding attacks that exploit a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer application retired cyber security expert richard a clarke was a group member and stated on april 11 that nsa had no advance knowledge of heartbleed67 illegally obtained evidenceedit further information parallel construction § parallel construction in the united states drug enforcement administration in august 2013 it was revealed that a 2005 irs training document showed that nsa intelligence intercepts and wiretaps both foreign and domestic were being supplied to the drug enforcement administration dea and internal revenue service irs and were illegally used to launch criminal investigations of us citizens law enforcement agents were directed to conceal how the investigations began and recreate an apparently legal investigative trail by reobtaining the same evidence by other means6869 barack obama administrationedit in the months leading to april 2009 the nsa intercepted the communications of american citizens including a congressman although the justice department believed that the interception was unintentional the justice department then took action to correct the issues and bring the program into compliance with existing laws70 united states attorney general eric holder resumed the program according to his understanding of the foreign intelligence surveillance act amendment of 2008 without explaining what had occurred71 polls conducted in june 2013 found divided results among americans regarding nsas secret data collection72 rasmussen reports found that 59 of americans disapprove73 gallup found that 53 disapprove74 and pew found that 56 are in favor of nsa data collection75 section 215 metadata collectionedit on april 25 2013 the nsa obtained a court order requiring verizons business network services to provide metadata on all calls in its system to the nsa on an ongoing daily basis for a threemonth period as reported by the guardian on june 6 2013 this information includes the numbers of both parties on a call  location data call duration unique identifiers and the time and duration of all calls but not the contents of the conversation itself the order relies on the socalled business records provision of the patriot act7677 in august 2013 following the snowden leaks new details about the nsas data mining activity were revealed reportedly the majority of emails into or out of the united states are captured at selected communications links and automatically analyzed for keywords or other selectors emails that do not match are deleted78 the utility of such a massive metadata collection in preventing terrorist attacks is disputed many studies reveal the dragnet like system to be ineffective one such report released by the new america foundation concluded that after an analysis of 225 terrorism cases the nsa had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism79 defenders of the program said that while metadata alone cant provide all the information necessary to prevent an attack it assures the ability to connect the dots80 between suspect foreign numbers and domestic numbers with a speed only the nsas software is capable of one benefit of this is quickly being able to determine the difference between suspicious activity and real threatscitation needed as an example nsa director general keith alexander mentioned at the annual cybersecurity summit in 2013 that metadata analysis of domestic phone call records after the boston marathon bombing helped determine thatclarification needed another attack in new york was baseless80 in addition to doubts about its effectiveness many people argue that the collection of metadata is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy as of 2015update the collection process remains legal and grounded in the ruling from smith v maryland 1979 a prominent opponent of the data collection and its legality is us district judge richard j leon who issued a report in 201381 in which he stated i cannot imagine a more indiscriminate and arbitrary invasion than this systematic and high tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approvalsurely such a program infringes on that degree of privacy that the founders enshrined in the fourth amendment as of may 7 2015 the us court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that the interpretation of section 215 of the patriot act was wrong and that the nsa program that has been collecting americans phone records in bulk is illegal82 it stated that section 215 cannot be clearly interpreted to allow government to collect national phone data and as a result expired on june 1 2015 this ruling is the first time a higherlevel court in the regular judicial system has reviewed the nsa phone records program 83 the replacement law known as the usa freedom act which will enable the nsa to continue to have bulk access to citizens metadata but with the stipulation that the data will now be stored by the companies themselves83 this change will not have any effect on other agency procedures outside of metadata collection which have purportedly challenged americans fourth amendment rights84 including upstream collection a mass of techniques used by the agency to collect and store americans datacommunications directly from the internet backbone85 under programs like prism the nsa paid billions of dollars to telecommunications companies in order to collect data from them86 while companies such as google and yahoo claim that they do not provide direct access from their servers to the nsa unless under a court order87 the nsa had access to emails phone calls and cellular data users88 under this new ruling telecommunications companies maintain bulk user metadata on their servers for at least 18 months to be provided upon request to the nsa83 this ruling made the mass storage of specific phone records at nsa datacenters illegal but it did not rule on section 215s constitutionality83 fourth amendment encroachmentedit in a declassified document it was revealed that 17835 phone lines were on an improperly permitted alert list from 2006 to 2009 in breach of compliance which tagged these phone lines for daily monitoring899091 eleven percent of these monitored phone lines met the agencys legal standard for reasonably articulable suspicion ras8992 the nsa tracks the locations of hundreds of millions of cellphones per day allowing it to map peoples movements and relationships in detail93 the nsa has been reported to have access to all communications made via google microsoft facebook yahoo youtube aol skype apple and paltalk94 and collects hundreds of millions of contact lists from personal email and instant messaging accounts each year95 it has also managed to weaken much of the encryption used on the internet by collaborating with coercing or otherwise infiltrating numerous technology companies to leave backdoors into their systems so that the majority of encryption is inadverently vulnerable to different forms of attack9697 domestically the nsa has been proven to collect and store metadata records of phone calls98 including over 120 million us verizon subscribers99 as well as intercept vast amounts of communications via the internet upstream94 the governments legal standing had been to rely on a secret interpretation of the patriot act whereby the entirety of us communications may be considered relevant to a terrorism investigation if it is expected that even a tiny minority may relate to terrorism100 the nsa also supplies foreign intercepts to the dea irs and other law enforcement agencies who use these to initiate criminal investigations federal agents are then instructed to recreate the investigative trail via parallel construction101 the nsa also spies on influential muslims to obtain information that could be used to discredit them such as their use of pornography the targets both domestic and abroad are not suspected of any crime but hold religious or political views deemed radical by the nsa102 according to a report in the washington post in july 2014 relying on information provided by snowden 90 of those placed under surveillance in the us are ordinary americans and are not the intended targets the newspaper said it had examined documents including emails text messages and online accounts that support the claim103 congressional oversightedit play media excerpt of james clapper’s testimony before the senate select committee on intelligence despite white house claims that these programs have congressional oversight many members of congress were unaware of the existence of these nsa programs or the secret interpretation of the patriot act and have consistently been denied access to basic information about them104 to further understand what our country leaders were unaware of one must look into a classified document exposed by edward snowden which revealed that nsa was monitoring thirtyfive world leader phone conversations105 the united states foreign intelligence surveillance court the secret court charged with regulating the nsas activities is according to its chief judge incapable of investigating or verifying how often the nsa breaks even its own secret rules106 it has since been reported that the nsa violated its own rules on data access thousands of times a year many of these violations involving largescale data interceptions107 nsa officers have even used data intercepts to spy on love interests108 most of the nsa violations were selfreported and each instance resulted in administrative action of termination109 the nsa has generally disregarded the special rules for disseminating united states person information by illegally sharing its intercepts with other law enforcement agencies110 a march 2009 fisa court opinion which the court released states that protocols restricting data queries had been so frequently and systemically violated that it can be fairly said that this critical element of the overall regime has never functioned effectively111112 in 2011 the same court noted that the volume and nature of the nsas bulk foreign internet intercepts was fundamentally different from what the court had been led to believe110 email contact lists including those of us citizens are collected at numerous foreign locations to work around the illegality of doing so on us soil95 legal opinions on the nsas bulk collection program have differed in middecember 2013 us district judge richard leon ruled that the almostorwellian program likely violates the constitution and wrote i cannot imagine a more indiscriminate and arbitrary invasion than this systematic and hightech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval surely such a program infringes on that degree of privacy that the founders enshrined in the fourth amendment indeed i have little doubt that the author of our constitution james madison who cautioned us to beware the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power would be aghast113 later that month us district judge william pauley ruled that the nsas collection of telephone records is legal and valuable in the fight against terrorism in his opinion he wrote a bulk telephony metadata collection program is a wide net that could find and isolate gossamer contacts among suspected terrorists in an ocean of seemingly disconnected data and noted that a similar collection of data prior to 911 might have prevented the attack114 official responsesedit at a march 2013 senate intelligence committee hearing senator ron wyden asked director of national intelligence james clapper does the nsa collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of americans clapper replied no sir not wittingly there are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not wittingly115 this statement came under scrutiny months later in june 2013 details of the prism surveillance program were published showing that the nsa apparently can gain access to the servers of nine internet companies for a wide range of digital data115 wyden said that clapper had failed to give a straight answer in his testimony clapper in response to criticism said i responded in what i thought was the most truthful or least untruthful manner clapper added there are honest differences on the semantics of what when someone says ‘collection’ to me that has a specific meaning which may have a different meaning to him115 nsa whistlerblower edward snowden additionally revealed the existence of xkeyscore a top secret nsa program that allows the agency to search vast databases of the metadata as well as the content of emails and other internet activity such as browser history with capability to search by name telephone number ip address keywords the language in which the internet activity was conducted or the type of browser used116 xkeyscore provides the technological capability if not the legal authority to target even us persons for extensive electronic surveillance without a warrant provided that some identifying information such as their email or ip address is known to the analyst116 regarding the necessity of these nsa programs alexander stated on june 27 that the nsas bulk phone and internet intercepts had been instrumental in preventing 54 terrorist events including 13 in the us and in all but one of these cases had provided the initial tip to unravel the threat stream117 on july 31 nsa deputy director john inglis conceded to the senate that these intercepts had not been vital in stopping any terrorist attacks but were close to vital in identifying and convicting four san diego men for sending us8930 to alshabaab a militia that conducts terrorism in somalia118119120 the us government has aggressively sought to dismiss and challenge fourth amendment cases raised against it and has granted retroactive immunity to isps and telecoms participating in domestic surveillance121122 the us military has acknowledged blocking access to parts of the guardian website for thousands of defense personnel across the country123124 and blocking the entire guardian website for personnel stationed throughout afghanistan the middle east and south asia125 an october 2014 united nations report condemned mass surveillance by the united states and other countries as violating multiple international treaties and conventions that guarantee core privacy rights126 wikimedia foundation v nsaedit see also wikimedia foundation v nsa the wikimedia foundation and several other plaintiffs filed suit against the nsa in 2015 wikimedia foundation v nsa for the violation of their users first and fourth amendement rights by the agencys mass surveillance programs like upstream127 the suit was initially dismissed but was later found to have plausible and legal standing to its complaints by the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit and was remanded the case is currently awaiting further proceedings at the united states district court for the district of maryland128 responsibility for international ransomware attackedit an exploit eternalblue which is believed to have been created by the nsa was used in the unprecedented worldwide wannacry ransomware attack in may 2017 the exploit had been leaked online by a hacking group the shadow brokers nearly a month prior to the attack a number of experts have pointed the finger at the nsas nondisclosure of the underlying vulnerability and their loss of control over the eternalblue attack tool that exploited it edward snowden said that if the nsa had privately disclosed the flaw used to attack hospitals when they found it not when they lost it the attack might not have happened129 wikipedia cofounder jimmy wales stated that he joined with microsoft and the other leaders of the industry in saying this is a huge screwup by the government the moment the nsa found it they should have notified microsoft so they could quietly issue a patch and really chivvy people along long before it became a huge problem130 operationsedit operations by the national security agency can be divided in three types collection overseas which falls under the responsibility of the global access operations gao division domestic collection which falls under the responsibility of the special source operations sso division hacking operations which falls under the responsibility of the tailored access operations tao division collection overseasedit capri osedit capri os is a national security agency codename for a project that is sent ssh and ssl intercepts for postprocessing131 echelonedit main article echelon echelon was created in the incubator of the cold war132 today it is a legacy system and several nsa stations are closing133 nsacss in combination with the equivalent agencies in the united kingdom government communications headquarters canada communications security establishment australia defence signals directorate and new zealand government communications security bureau otherwise known as the ukusa group134 was reported to be in command of the operation of the socalled echelon system its capabilities were suspected to include the ability to monitor a large proportion of the worlds transmitted civilian telephone fax and data traffic135 during the early 1970s the first of what became more than eight large satellite communications dishes were installed at menwith hill136 investigative journalist duncan campbell reported in 1988 on the echelon surveillance program an extension of the ukusa agreement on global signals intelligence sigint and detailed how the eavesdropping operations worked137 in november 3 1999 the bbc reported that they had confirmation from the australian government of the existence of a powerful global spying network codenamed echelon that could eavesdrop on every single phone call fax or email anywhere on the planet with britain and the united states as the chief protagonists they confirmed that menwith hill was linked directly to the headquarters of the us national security agency nsa at fort meade in maryland138 nsas united states signals intelligence directive 18 ussid 18 strictly prohibited the interception or collection of information about us persons entities corporations or organizations without explicit written legal permission from the united states attorney general when the subject is located abroad or the foreign intelligence surveillance court when within us borders alleged echelonrelated activities including its use for motives other than national security including political and industrial espionage received criticism from countries outside the ukusa alliance139140 protesters against nsa data mining in berlin wearing chelsea manning and edward snowden masks other sigint operations overseasedit the nsa was also involved in planning to blackmail people with sexint intelligence gained about a potential targets sexual activity and preferences those targeted had not committed any apparent crime nor were they charged with one141 in order to support its facial recognition program the nsa is intercepting millions of images per day142 the real time regional gateway is a data collection program introduced in 2005 in iraq by nsa during the iraq war that consisted of gathering all electronic communication storing it then searching and otherwise analyzing it it was effective in providing information about iraqi insurgents who had eluded less comprehensive techniques143 this collect it all strategy introduced by nsa director keith b alexander is believed by glenn greenwald of the guardian to be the model for the comprehensive worldwide mass archiving of communications which nsa is engaged in as of 2013144 boundlessinformantedit edward snowden revealed in june 2013 that between february 8 and march 8 2013 the nsa collected about 1248 billion telephone data items and 971 billion computer data items throughout the world as was displayed in charts from an internal nsa tool codenamed boundless informant it was reported that some of these data reflected eavesdropping on citizens in countries like germany spain and france145 boundlessinformant employs big data databases cloud computing technology and free and open source software foss to analyze data collected worldwide by the nsa146 bypassing encryptionedit in 2013 reporters uncovered a secret memo that claims the nsa created and pushed for the adoption of the dual ec drbg encryption standard that contained builtin vulnerabilities in 2006 to the united states national institute of standards and technology nist and the international organization for standardization aka iso147148 this memo appears to give credence to previous speculation by cryptographers at microsoft research149 edward snowden claims that the nsa often bypasses encryption altogether by lifting information before it is encrypted or after it is decrypted148 xkeyscore rules as specified in a file xkeyscorerules100txt sourced by german tv stations ndr and wdr who claim to have excerpts from its source code reveal that the nsa tracks users of privacyenhancing software tools including tor an anonymous email service provided by the mit computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail in cambridge massachusetts and readers of the linux journal150151 software backdoorsedit linux kerneledit linus torvalds the founder of linux kernel joked during a linuxcon keynote on september 18 2013 that the nsa who are the founder of selinux wanted a backdoor in the kernel152 however later linus father a member of the european parliament mep revealed that the nsa actually did this153 when my oldest son was asked the same question has he been approached by the nsa about backdoors he said no but at the same time he nodded then he was sort of in the legal free he had given the right answer everybody understood that the nsa had approached him — nils torvalds libe committee inquiry on electronic mass surveillance of eu citizens – 11th hearing 11 november 2013154 ibm notesedit ibm notes was the first widely adopted software product to use public key cryptography for client–server and server–server authentication and for encryption of data until us laws regulating encryption were changed in 2000 ibm and lotus were prohibited from exporting versions of notes that supported symmetric encryption keys that were longer than 40 bits in 1997 lotus negotiated an agreement with the nsa that allowed export of a version that supported stronger keys with 64 bits but 24 of the bits were encrypted with a special key and included in the message to provide a workload reduction factor for the nsa this strengthened the protection for users of notes outside the us against privatesector industrial espionage but not against spying by the us government155156 boomerang routingedit while it is assumed that foreign transmissions terminating in the us such as a nonus citizen accessing a us website subject nonus citizens to nsa surveillance recent research into boomerang routing has raised new concerns about the nsas ability to surveil the domestic internet traffic of foreign countries18 boomerang routing occurs when an internet transmission that originates and terminates in a single country transits another research at the university of toronto has suggested that approximately 25 of canadian domestic traffic may be subject to nsa surveillance activities as a result of the boomerang routing of canadian internet service providers18 hardware implantingedit intercepted packages are opened carefully by nsa employees a load station implanting a beacon a document included in nsa files released with glenn greenwalds book no place to hide details how the agencys tailored access operations tao and other nsa units gain access to hardware they intercept routers servers and other network hardware being shipped to organizations targeted for surveillance and install covert implant firmware onto them before they are delivered this was described by an nsa manager as some of the most productive operations in tao because they preposition access points into hard target networks around the world157 computers seized by the nsa due to interdiction are often modified with a physical device known as cottonmouth158 cottonmouth is a device that can be inserted in the usb port of a computer in order to establish remote access to the targeted machine according to nsas tailored access operations tao group implant catalog after implanting cottonmouth the nsa can establish bridging networking that allows the nsa to load exploit software onto modified computers as well as allowing the nsa to relay commands and data between hardware and software implants159 domestic collectionedit further information mass surveillance in the united states nsas mission as set forth in executive order 12333 in 1981 is to collect information that constitutes foreign intelligence or counterintelligence while not acquiring information concerning the domestic activities of united states persons nsa has declared that it relies on the fbi to collect information on foreign intelligence activities within the borders of the united states while confining its own activities within the united states to the embassies and missions of foreign nations160 the appearance of a domestic surveillance directorate of the nsa was soon exposed as a hoax in 2013161162 nsas domestic surveillance activities are limited by the requirements imposed by the fourth amendment to the us constitution the foreign intelligence surveillance court for example held in october 2011 citing multiple supreme court precedents that the fourth amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures applies to the contents of all communications whatever the means because a persons private communications are akin to personal papers163 however these protections do not apply to nonus persons located outside of us borders so the nsas foreign surveillance efforts are subject to far fewer limitations under us law164 the specific requirements for domestic surveillance operations are contained in the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978 fisa which does not extend protection to nonus citizens located outside of us territory164 george w bush administrationedit george w bush president during the 911 terrorist attacks approved the patriot act shortly after the attacks to take antiterrorist security measures title 1 2 and 9 specifically authorized measures that would be taken by the nsa these titles granted enhanced domestic security against terrorism surveillance procedures and improved intelligence respectively on march 10 2004 there was a debate between president bush and white house counsel alberto gonzales attorney general john ashcroft and acting attorney general james comey the attorney generals were unsure if the nsas programs could be considered constitutional they threatened to resign over the matter but ultimately the nsas programs continued165 on march 11 2004 president bush signed a new authorization for mass surveillance of internet records in addition to the surveillance of phone records this allowed the president to be able to override laws such as the foreign intelligence surveillance act which protected civilians from mass surveillance in addition to this president bush also signed that the measures of mass surveillance were also retroactively in place166 the prism programedit prism a clandestine surveillance program under which the nsa collects user data from companies like microsoft and facebook under the prism program which started in 2007167168 nsa gathers internet communications from foreign targets from nine major us internetbased communication service providers microsoft169 yahoo google facebook paltalk aol skype youtube and apple data gathered include email video and voice chat videos photos voip chats such as skype and file transfers june 2015 – wikileaks industrial espionageedit in june 2015 wikileaks published documents which showed that nsa spied on french companies170 july 2015 – wikileaks espionage against german federal ministriesedit in july 2015 wikileaks published documents which showed that nsa spied on federal german ministries since 1990s171172 even germanys chancellor angela merkels cellphones and phone of her predecessors had been intercepted173 claims of prevented terrorist attacksedit former nsa director general keith alexander claimed that in september 2009 the nsa prevented najibullah zazi and his friends from carrying out a terrorist attack174 however this claim has been debunked and no evidence has been presented demonstrating that the nsa has ever been instrumental in preventing a terrorist attack175176177178 hacking

february 2016 learn how and when to remove this template message besides the more traditional ways of eavesdropping in order to collect signals intelligence nsa is also engaged in hacking computers smartphones and their networks these operations are conducted by the tailored access operations tao division nsas china hacking groupedit according to the foreign policy magazine the office of tailored access operations or tao has successfully penetrated chinese computer and telecommunications systems for almost 15 years generating some of the best and most reliable intelligence information about what is going on inside the peoples republic of china179180 syrian internet blackoutedit in an interview with wired magazine edward snowden said the tailored access operations division accidentally caused syrias internet blackout in 2012181 organizational structureedit michael s rogers the director of the nsa the nsa is led by the director of the national security agency dirnsa who also serves as chief of the central security service chcss and commander of the united states cyber command uscybercom and is the highestranking military official of these organizations he is assisted by a deputy director who is the highestranking civilian within the nsacss nsa also has an inspector general head of the office of the inspector general oig a general counsel head of the office of the general counsel ogc and a director of compliance who is head of the office of the director of compliance odoc182 unlike other intelligence organizations such as cia or dia nsa has always been particularly reticent concerning its internal organizational structure as of the mid1990s the national security agency was organized into five directorates the operations directorate which was responsible for sigint collection and processing the technology and systems directorate which develops new technologies for sigint collection and processing the information systems security directorate which was responsible for nsas communications and information security missions the plans policy and programs directorate which provided staff support and general direction for the agency the support services directorate which provided logistical and administrative support activities183 each of these directorates consisted of several groups or elements designated by a letter there were for example the a group which was responsible for all sigint operations against the soviet union and eastern europe and g group which was responsible for sigint related to all noncommunist countries these groups were divided in units designated by an additional number like unit a5 for breaking soviet codes and g6 being the office for the middle east north africa cuba central and south america184185 directoratesedit as of 2013update nsa has about a dozen directorates which are designated by a letter although not all of them are publicly known the directorates are divided in divisions and units starting with the letter of the parent directorate followed by a number for the division the subunit or a subsubunit the main elements of the organizational structure of the nsa are186 f – directorate only known from unit f6 the special collection service scs which is a joint program created by cia and nsa in 1978 to facilitate clandestine activities such as bugging computers throughout the world using the expertise of both agencies187 g – directorate only known from unit g112 the office that manages the senior span platform attached to the u2 spy planes188 i – information assurance directorate iad which ensures availability integrity authentication confidentiality and nonrepudiation of national security and telecommunications and information systems national security systems j – directorate only known from unit j2 the cryptologic intelligence unit l – installation and logistics m – human resources q – security and counterintelligence r – research directorate which conducts research on signals intelligence and on information assurance for the us government189 s – signals intelligence directorate sid which is responsible for the collection analysis production and dissemination of signals intelligence this directorate is led by a director and a deputy director the sid consists of the following divisions s1 – customer relations s2 – analysis and production centers with the following socalled product lines s2a south asia s2b china and korea s2c international security s2e middle eastasia s2f international crime s2g counterproliferation s2h russia s2i counterterrorism s2j weapons and space s2t current threats s3 – data acquisition with these divisions for the main collection programs s31 – cryptanalysis and exploitation services ces s32 – tailored access operations tao which hacks into foreign computers to conduct cyberespionage and reportedly is the largest and arguably the most important component of the nsas huge signal intelligence sigint directorate consisting of over 1000 military and civilian computer hackers intelligence analysts targeting specialists computer hardware and software designers and electrical engineers190 s33 – global access operations gao which is responsible for intercepts from satellites and other international sigint platforms191 a tool which details and maps the information collected by this unit is codenamed boundless informant s34 – collections strategies and requirements center s35 – special source operations sso which is responsible for domestic and compartmented collection programs like for example the prism program191 special source operations is also mentioned in connection to the fairview collection program192 t – technical directorate td directorate for education and training directorate for corporate leadership foreign affairs directorate which acts as liaison with foreign intelligence services counterintelligence centers and the ukusapartners acquisitions and procurement directorate information sharing services iss led by a chief and a deputy chief193 in the year 2000 a leadership team was formed consisting of the director the deputy director and the directors of the signals intelligence sid the information assurance iad and the technical directorate td the chiefs of other main nsa divisions became associate directors of the senior leadership team194 after president george w bush initiated the presidents surveillance program psp in 2001 the nsa created a 24hour metadata analysis center mac followed in 2004 by the advanced analysis division aad with the mission of analyzing content internet metadata and telephone metadata both units were part of the signals intelligence directorate195 a 2016 proposal would combine the signals intelligence directorate with information assurance directorate into directorate of operations196 nsanetedit behind the green door – secure communications room with separate computer terminals for access to siprnet gwan nsanet and jwics nsanet stands for national security agency network and is the official nsa intranet197 it is a classified network198 for information up to the level of tssci199 to support the use and sharing of intelligence data between nsa and the signals intelligence agencies of the four other nations of the five eyes partnership the management of nsanet has been delegated to the central security service texas csstexas200 nsanet is a highly secured computer network consisting of fiberoptic and satellite communication channels which are almost completely separated from the public internet the network allows nsa personnel and civilian and military intelligence analysts anywhere in the world to have access to the agencys systems and databases this access is tightly controlled and monitored for example every keystroke is logged activities are audited at random and downloading and printing of documents from nsanet are recorded201 in 1998 nsanet along with niprnet and siprnet had significant problems with poor search capabilities unorganized data and old information202 in 2004 the network was reported to have used over twenty commercial offtheshelf operating systems203 some universities that do highly sensitive research are allowed to connect to it204 the thousands of top secret internal nsa documents that were taken by edward snowden in 2013 were stored in a filesharing location on the nsas intranet site so they could easily be read online by nsa personnel everyone with a tssciclearance had access to these documents as system administrator snowden was responsible for moving accidentally misplaced highly sensitive documents to safer storage locations205 watch centersedit the nsa maintains at least two watch centers national security operations center nsoc which is the nsas current operations center and focal point for timesensitive sigint reporting for the united states sigint system usss this center was established in 1968 as the national sigint watch center nswc and renamed into national sigint operations center nsoc in 1973 this nerve center of the nsa got its current name in 1996206 nsacss threat operations center ntoc which is the primary nsacss partner for department of homeland security response to cyber incidents the ntoc establishes realtime network awareness and threat characterization capabilities to forecast alert and attribute malicious activity and enable the coordination of computer network operations the ntoc was established in 2004 as a joint information assurance and signals intelligence project207 employeesedit the number of nsa employees is officially classified4 but there are several sources providing estimates in 1961 nsa had 59000 military and civilian employees which grew to 93067 in 1969 of which 19300 worked at the headquarters at fort meade in the early 1980s nsa had roughly 50000 military and civilian personnel by 1989 this number had grown again to 75000 of which 25000 worked at the nsa headquarters between 1990 and 1995 the nsas budget and workforce were cut by one third which led to a substantial loss of experience208 in 2012 the nsa said more than 30000 employees worked at fort meade and other facilities2 in 2012 john c inglis the deputy director said that the total number of nsa employees is somewhere between 37000 and one billion as a joke4 and stated that the agency is probably the biggest employer of introverts4 in 2013 der spiegel stated that the nsa had 40000 employees5 more widely it has been described as the worlds largest single employer of mathematicians209 some nsa employees form part of the workforce of the national reconnaissance office nro the agency that provides the nsa with satellite signals intelligence as of 2013 about 1000 system administrators work for the nsa210 personnel securityedit the nsa received criticism early on in 1960 after two agents had defected to the soviet union investigations by the house unamerican activities committee and a special subcommittee of the united states house committee on armed services revealed severe cases of ignorance in personnel security regulations prompting the former personnel director and the director of security to step down and leading to the adoption of stricter security practices211 nonetheless security breaches reoccurred only a year later when in an issue of izvestia of july 23 1963 a former nsa employee published several cryptologic secrets the very same day an nsa clerkmessenger committed suicide as ongoing investigations disclosed that he had sold secret information to the soviets on a regular basis the reluctance of congressional houses to look into these affairs had prompted a journalist to write if a similar series of tragic blunders occurred in any ordinary agency of government an aroused public would insist that those responsible be officially censured demoted or fired david kahn criticized the nsas tactics of concealing its doings as smug and the congress blind faith in the agencys rightdoing as shortsighted and pointed out the necessity of surveillance by the congress to prevent abuse of power211 edward snowdens leaking of the existence of prism in 2013 caused the nsa to institute a twoman rule where two system administrators are required to be present when one accesses certain sensitive information210 snowden claims he suggested such a rule in 2009212 polygraphingedit defense security service dss polygraph brochure given to nsa applicants the nsa conducts polygraph tests of employees for new employees the tests are meant to discover enemy spies who are applying to the nsa and to uncover any information that could make an applicant pliant to coercion213 as part of the latter historically epqs or embarrassing personal questions about sexual behavior had been included in the nsa polygraph213 the nsa also conducts fiveyear periodic reinvestigation polygraphs of employees focusing on counterintelligence programs in addition the nsa conducts periodic polygraph investigations in order to find spies and leakers those who refuse to take them may receive termination of employment according to a 1982 memorandum from the director of nsa214 play media nsaproduced video on the polygraph process there are also special access examination polygraphs for employees who wish to work in highly sensitive areas and those polygraphs cover counterintelligence questions and some questions about behavior214 nsas brochure states that the average test length is between two and four hours215 a 1983 report of the office of technology assessment stated that it appears that the nsa national security agency and possibly cia use the polygraph not to determine deception or truthfulness per se but as a technique of interrogation to encourage admissions216 sometimes applicants in the polygraph process confess to committing felonies such as murder rape and selling of illegal drugs between 1974 and 1979 of the 20511 job applicants who took polygraph tests 695 34 confessed to previous felony crimes almost all of those crimes had been undetected213 in 2010 the nsa produced a video explaining its polygraph process217 the video ten minutes long is titled the truth about the polygraph and was posted to the web site of the defense security service jeff stein of the washington post said that the video portrays various applicants or actors playing them — its not clear — describing everything bad they had heard about the test the implication being that none of it is true218 antipolygraphorg argues that the nsaproduced video omits some information about the polygraph process it produced a video responding to the nsa video217 george maschke the founder of the web site accused the nsa polygraph video of being orwellian218 after edward snowden revealed his identity in 2013 the nsa began requiring polygraphing of employees once per quarter219 arbitrary firingedit the number of exemptions from legal requirements has been criticized when in 1964 the congress was hearing a bill giving the director of the nsa the power to fire at will any employeethe washington post wrote this is the very definition of arbitrariness it means that an employee could be discharged and disgraced on the basis of anonymous allegations without the slightest opportunity to defend himself yet the bill was accepted by an overwhelming majority211 also every person hired to a job in the us after 2007 at any private organization state or federal government agency must be reported to the new hire registry ostensibly to look for child support evaders except that employees of an intelligence agency may be excluded from reporting if the director deems it necessary for national security reasons facilitiesedit headquartersedit history of headquartersedit headquarters at fort meade circa 1950s when the agency was first established its headquarters and cryptographic center were in the naval security station in washington dc the comint functions were located in arlington hall in northern virginia which served as the headquarters of the us armys cryptographic operations220 because the soviet union had detonated a nuclear bomb and because the facilities were crowded the federal government wanted to move several agencies including the afsansa a planning committee considered fort knox but fort meade maryland was ultimately chosen as nsa headquarters because it was far enough away from washington dc in case of a nuclear strike and was close enough so its employees would not have to move their families221 construction of additional buildings began after the agency occupied buildings at ft meade in the late 1950s which they soon outgrew221 in 1963 the new headquarters building nine stories tall opened nsa workers referred to the building as the headquarters building and since the nsa management occupied the top floor workers used ninth floor to refer to their leaders222 comsec remained in washington dc until its new building was completed in 1968221 in september 1986 the operations 2a and 2b buildings both coppershielded to prevent eavesdropping opened with a dedication by president ronald reagan223 the four nsa buildings became known as the big four223 the nsa director moved to 2b when it opened223 national security agency headquarters in fort meade 2013 headquarters for the national security agency

largest electricity consumer in maryland229 following a major power outage in 2000 in 2003 and in followups through 2007 the baltimore sun reported that the nsa was at risk of electrical overload because of insufficient internal electrical infrastructure at fort meade to support the amount of equipment being installed this problem was apparently recognized in the 1990s but not made a priority and now the agencys ability to keep its operations going is threatened243 on august 6 2006 the baltimore sun reported that the nsa had completely maxed out the grid and that baltimore gas electric bge now constellation energy was unable to sell them any more power 244 nsa decided to move some of its operations to a new satellite facility bge provided nsa with 65 to 75 megawatts at ft meade in 2007 and expected that an increase of 10 to 15 megawatts would be needed later that year245 in 2011 nsa at ft meade was marylands largest consumer of power229 in 2007 as bges largest customer nsa bought as much electricity as annapolis the capital city of maryland243 one estimate put the potential for power consumption by the new utah data center at us40 million per year246 computing assetsedit in 1995

construction on nsas first comprehensive national cybersecurity initiative cnci data center known as the utah data center for short the 15b data center is being built at camp williams utah located 25 miles 40 km south of salt lake city and will help support the agencys national cybersecurity initiative254 it is expected to be operational by september 2013246 in 2009 to protect its assets and access more electricity nsa sought to decentralize and expand its existing facilities in ft meade and menwith hill255 the latter expansion expected to be completed by 2015256 the yakima heraldrepublic cited bamford saying that many of nsas bases for its echelon program were a legacy system using outdated 1990s technology133 in 2004 nsa closed its operations at bad aibling station field station 81 in bad aibling germany257 in 2012 nsa began to move some of its operations at yakima research station yakima training center in washington state to colorado planning to leave yakima closed258 as of 2013 nsa also intended to close operations at sugar grove west virginia133 international stationsedit raf menwith hill has the largest nsa presence in the united kingdom256 following the signing in

bude in morwenstow united kingdom geraldton pine gap and shoal bay australia leitrim and ottawa ontario canada misawa japan and waihopai and tangimoana261 new zealand262 nsa operates raf menwith hill in north yorkshire united kingdom which was according to bbc news in 2007 the largest electronic monitoring station in the world263 planned in 1954 and opened in 1960 the base covered 562 acres 227 ha 0878 sq mi in 1999264 the agencys european cryptologic center ecc with 240 employees in 2011 is headquartered at a us military compound in griesheim near frankfurt in germany a 2011 nsa report indicates that the ecc is responsible for the largest analysis and productivity in europe and focusses on various priorities including africa europe the middle east and counterterrorism operations265 in 2013 a new consolidated intelligence center also to be used by nsa is being built at the headquarters of the united states army europe in wiesbaden germany266 nsas partnership with bundesnachrichtendienst bnd the german foreign intelligence service was confirmed by bnd president gerhard schindler266 thailandedit thailand is a 3rd party partner of the nsa along with nine other nations267 these are nonenglishspeaking countries that have made security agreements for the exchange of sigint raw material and end product reports thailand is the site of at least two us sigint collection stations one is at the us embassy in bangkok a joint nsacia special collection service scs unit it presumably eavesdrops on foreign embassies governmental communications and other targets of opportunity268 the second installation is a fornsat foreign satellite interception station in the thai city of khon kaen it is codenamed indra but has also been referred to as lemonwood268 the station is approximately 40 ha 100 acres in size and consists of a large 3700–4600 m2 40000–50000 ft2 operations building on the west side of the ops compound and four radomeenclosed parabolic antennas possibly two of the radomeenclosed antennas are used for satcom intercept and two antennas used for relaying the intercepted material back to nsa there is also a pushertype circularlydisposed antenna array cdaa array just north of the ops compound269270 nsa activated khon kaen in october 1979 its mission was to eavesdrop on the radio traffic of chinese army and air force units in southern china especially in and around the city of kunming in yunnan province back in the late 1970s the base consisted only of a small cdaa antenna array that was remotecontrolled via satellite from the nsa listening post at kunia hawaii and a small force of civilian contractors from bendix field engineering corp whose job it was to keep the antenna array and satellite relay facilities up and running 247269 according to the papers of the late general william odom the indra facility was upgraded in 1986 with a new britishmade pusher cdaa antenna as part of an overall upgrade of nsa and thai sigint facilities whose objective was to spy on the neighboring communist nations of vietnam laos and cambodia269 the base apparently fell into disrepair in the 1990s as china and vietnam became more friendly towards the us and by 2002 archived satellite imagery showed that the pusher cdaa antenna had been torn down perhaps indicating that the base had been closed at some point in the period since 911 the khon kaen base was reactivated and expanded to include a sizeable satcom intercept mission it is likely that the nsa presence at khon kaen is relatively small and that most of the work is done by civilian contractors269 research and developmentedit nsa has been involved in debates about public policy both indirectly as a behindthescenes adviser to other departments and directly during and after vice admiral bobby ray inmans directorship nsa was a major player in the debates of the 1990s regarding the export of cryptography in the united states restrictions on export were reduced but not eliminated in 1996 its secure government communications work has involved the nsa in numerous technology areas including the design of specialized communications hardware and software production of dedicated semiconductors at the ft meade chip fabrication plant and advanced cryptography research for 50 years nsa designed and built most of its computer equipment inhouse but from the 1990s until about 2003 when the us congress curtailed the practice the agency contracted with the private sector in the fields of research and equipment271 data encryption standardedit main article data encryption standard frostburg was the nsas first supercomputer used from 1991 to 1997 nsa was embroiled in some minor controversy concerning its involvement in the creation of the data encryption standard des a standard and public block cipher algorithm used by the us government and banking community during the development of des by ibm in the 1970s nsa recommended changes to some details of the design there was suspicion that these changes had weakened the algorithm sufficiently to enable the agency to eavesdrop if required including speculation that a critical component—the socalled sboxes—had been altered to insert a backdoor and that the reduction in key length might have made it feasible for nsa to discover des keys using massive computing power it has since been observed that the sboxes in des are particularly resilient against differential cryptanalysis a technique which was not publicly discovered until the late 1980s but known to the ibm des team advanced encryption standardedit main article advanced encryption standard the involvement of nsa in selecting a successor to data encryption standard des the advanced encryption standard aes was limited to hardware performance testing see aes competition272 nsa has subsequently certified aes for protection of classified information when used in nsaapproved systems273 nsa encryption systemsedit stuiii secure

controlled frequency hopping281 ste secure terminal equipment278 taclane product line by general dynamics c4 systems282 the nsa has specified suite a and suite b cryptographic algorithm suites to be used in us government systems the suite b algorithms are a subset of those previously specified by nist and are expected to serve for most information protection purposes while the suite a algorithms are secret and are intended for especially high levels of protection273 shaedit the widely used sha1 and sha2 hash functions were designed by nsa sha1 is a slight modification of the weaker sha0 algorithm also designed by nsa in 1993 this small modification was suggested by nsa two years later with no justification other than the fact that it provides additional security an attack for sha0 that does not apply to the revised algorithm was indeed found between 1998 and 2005 by academic cryptographers because of weaknesses and key length restrictions in sha1 nist deprecates its use for digital signatures and approves only the newer sha2 algorithms for such applications from 2013 on283 a new hash standard sha3 has recently been selected through the competition concluded october 2 2012 with the selection of keccak as the algorithm the process to select sha3 was similar to the one held in choosing the aes but some doubts have been cast over it284285 since fundamental modifications have been made to keccak in order to turn it into a standard286 these changes potentially undermine the cryptanalysis performed during the competition and reduce the security levels of the algorithm284 dualecdrbg random number generator cryptotrojanedit main article dualecdrbg nsa promoted the inclusion of a random number generator called dual ec drbg in the us national institute of standards and technologys 2007 guidelines this led to speculation of a backdoor which would allow nsa access to data encrypted by systems using that pseudo random number generator287 this is now deemed to be plausible based on the fact that output of next iterations of prng can provably be determined if relation between two internal elliptic curve points is known288289 both nist and rsa are now officially recommending against the use of this prng290291 clipper chipedit main article clipper chip because of concerns that widespread use of strong cryptography would hamper government use of wiretaps nsa proposed the concept of key escrow in 1993 and introduced the clipper chip that would offer stronger protection than des but would allow access to encrypted data by authorized law enforcement officials292 the proposal was strongly opposed and key escrow requirements ultimately went nowhere293 however nsas fortezza hardwarebased encryption cards created for the clipper project are still used within government and nsa ultimately declassified and published the design of the skipjack cipher used on the cards294295 perfect citizenedit main article perfect citizen perfect citizen is a program to perform vulnerability assessment by the nsa on us critical infrastructure296297 it was originally reported to be a program to develop a system of sensors to detect cyber attacks on critical infrastructure computer networks in both the private and public sector through a network monitoring system named einstein298299 it is funded by the comprehensive national cybersecurity initiative and thus far raytheon has received a contract for up to 100 million for the initial stage academic researchedit nsa has invested many millions of dollars in academic research under grant code prefix mda904 resulting in over 3000 papers as of october 11 2007update nsacss has at times attempted to restrict the publication of academic research into cryptography for example the khufu and khafre block ciphers were voluntarily withheld in response to an nsa request to do so in response to a foia lawsuit in 2013 the nsa released the 643page research paper titled untangling the web a guide to internet research300 written and compiled by nsa employees to assist other nsa workers in searching for information of interest to the agency on the public internet301 patentsedit nsa has the ability to file for a patent from the us patent and trademark office under gag order unlike normal patents these are not revealed to the public and do not expire however if the patent office receives an application for an identical patent from a third party they will reveal nsas patent and officially grant it to nsa for the full term on that date302 one of nsas published patents describes a method of geographically locating an individual computer site in an internetlike network based on the latency of multiple network connections303 although no public patent exists nsa is reported to have used a similar locating technology called trilateralization that allows realtime tracking of an individuals location including altitude from ground level using data obtained from cellphone towers304 insignia and memorialsedit the heraldic insignia of nsa consists of an eagle inside a circle grasping a key in its talons305 the eagle represents the agencys national mission305 its breast features a shield with bands of red and white taken from the great seal of the united states and representing congress305 the key is taken from the emblem of saint peter and represents security305 when the nsa was created the agency had no emblem and used that of the department of defense306 the agency adopted its first of two emblems in 1963306 the current nsa insignia has been in use since 1965 when thendirector ltg marshall s carter usa ordered the creation of a device to represent the agency307 the nsas flag consists of the agencys seal on a light blue background national cryptologic memorial crews associated with nsa missions have been involved in a number of dangerous and deadly situations308 the uss liberty incident in 1967 and uss pueblo incident in 1968 are examples of the losses endured during the cold war308 the national security agencycentral security service cryptologic memorial honors and remembers the fallen personnel both military and civilian of
