page is to describe ways to clarify text or request such clarification there are inline cleanup tags to flag specific wording that is likely to be confusing to the average reader contents 1 when you need to flag unclear text 2 how to mark articles for clarification 3 how to improve articles that need clarification 4 specific clarification 5 see also 51 related inline templates 52 messagebox templates 53 related pages 6 references when you need to flag unclear text it is always best to take care of something when you notice it but that is not always possible you can choose one of these templates that tag text with inline messages to request specific clarifications that you cannot provide yourself clarify to mark individual phrases or sentences confusing to mark sections or entire articles though this is undesirable because it makes it unclear what exactly needs to be improved definition needed to mark a term as ambiguous or unclear and in need of a definition examples to mark individual phrases or sentences which require examples for clarification explain to mark individual phrases or sections which require further explanation for general ie nonexpert readers non sequitur to mark individual mentions of someone or something in an outofcontext way the relevance of which is unclear when using these templates be specific mark individual phrases sentences and sections in preference to entire articles also be sure to leave specific suggestions for improvement on the articles talkpage the templates pages will almost always have additional documentation on usage and parameters if not you can leave a message on the templates talk page requesting such information be added how to mark articles for clarification to ask for clarification for a particular phrase or sentence simply type clarify or what after the phrase or sentence to display a superscripted tag the tag will link here this is a confusing sentence which needs readers to apply much energy and time in order to understand the implicit meanings behind it and needs to be clarifiedrewrittenclarification needed to ask for further explanation of a point made in a particular phrase or sentence simply type explain or elucidate after the phrase or sentence to display a superscripted tag the tag will link here this sentence contains unexplained jargonfurther explanation needed to ask for clarification for a particular section simply type confusingsection at the top of the section to generate the following tagbox this section may be confusing or unclear to readers please help us clarify the section there might be a discussion about this on the talk page october 2017 learn how and when to remove this template message then update the articles talk page with specific aspects to be improved to ask for clarification for an entire article consider first whether it would be more productive to tag individual phrases sentences or sections with clarify if you cannot identify specific parts of the article that need clarification write what aspects of the article you believe need clarification on the articles talk page before tagging the entire article with confusing how to improve articles that need clarification explain jargon define technical terms add a brief definition when first using new terms like blog a web log of journal entries add a link to an unfamiliar topic define extra terms early such as related terms include explain regional variations and the slang of certain professions eg massachusetts rotary could it be shorter some guidelines which often help delete extraneous rambling words especially weasel words andor peacock terms replace clauses with adverbs to limit prepositions to about four per sentence replace longer words with shorter words split long sentences into shorter sentences again four prepositions per sentence use idioms or familiar phrases rather than electron flow field use electric current replace computer program text with source code idioms seem simpler as in viewpoint vs idiosyncratic approach to the perceived issue compare two sentences notwithstanding the controversy she with practiced skill proceeded to navigate megax corporation through difficult financial straits versus despite the controversy she navigated megax through difficult financial straits two prepositions and note the removal of nonneutral assessment add a diagram or photo complex text might be illustrated by a diagram wikimedia commons also has over 12 million images which can be searched such as for galaxy even if the image or diagram is not exact mention extra details in the captionarea or use templatesuperimpose or templatelocation map to overlay a custom labelsymbol onto an image add a wikitable or list multicolumn wikitables could clarify groups of data however simple lists with colonasterisk bullets might be enough see spark plug with a list of risksbenefits make it clear whats happening and to what a common example is a vague pronoun reference emily was friends with francine until she changed her job vague who changed jobs pronoun she equally applies to both also referring back to a list but not specifying the entry use specific wording rather than vague whenever possible for example instead of saying in the old days specify the time period you are referring to say the 19th century or the 1960s similarly do not reference now the word recently or soon or their synonyms will become meaningless quickly use as of or a specific date make sure youre using the right words in one of the great critiques of a fellow author mark twain listed eighteen rules of writing romantic fiction violated by james fenimore cooper1 besides the criticism of coopers characterisation and plot twain also said that a writer should avoid slovenliness of form employ a simple and straightforward style eschew surplusage see kiss principle not omit necessary details say what he is proposing to say not merely come near it avoid euphemisms we dont have to bowdlerize use good grammar use the right word not its second cousin check your intent wikipedia is a place to inform and to educate it is not a technical journal information from technical journals might need to be reduced to short sentences four prepositions because some journals encourage writing multilevel sentences spanning fifteen lines with subsubclauses check your spelling usually misspelled words are obvious in their intent eg qualty is obviously quality however tedting could be testing or texting or editing if it is not actually misspelled or it is intended to be so use the sic template make use of headings a huge block of text can be daunting but dividing it into sections and subsections can organize a logical structure onto the text separating statements into each grouped section specific clarification there are some common situations where use of a more specific clarification template might make the desired clarification clearer a common case is an article citing a scientific measurement without indicating how the measurement was taken for example the following statement about solar intensity at the earths surface without specifying the suns elevation could be annotated with the following tag the following tag links to a wikipedia project to clear bias based on the source of the information the suns intensity is 90 watts per square meterwhere see also distinguish related inline templates ambiguous clarify clarify span definition explain non sequitur technical statement vague messagebox templates confusing confusing
