mariners mlb 1999–present safeco field sometimes referred to as just the safe is a retractable roof baseball park located in seattle washington however unlike other retractable roof stadiums safeco field has what is called a retractable umbrella this is because when the roof is closed the stadium is still open on the sides to the outside weather so the mariners can play outdoor baseball even in the rain there is no need for heating or airconditioning because it is just like an outdoor stadium owned and operated by the washington state major league baseball stadium public facilities district it is the home stadium of the seattle mariners of major league baseball mlb and has a seating capacity of 47943 for baseball6 it is located in seattles sodo neighborhood near the western terminus of interstate 90 the first game was played on july 15 1999 during the 1990s the suitability of the mariners original stadium—the kingdome—as a mlb facility came under doubt and the teams ownership group threatened to relocate the team in september 1995 king county voters defeated a ballot measure to secure public funding for a new baseball stadium shortly thereafter the mariners first appearance in the mlb postseason and their victory in the 1995 american league division series alds renewed a public desire to keep the team in town as a result the washington state legislature approved an alternate means of funding for the stadium with public money the site for the stadium just south of the kingdome was selected in september 1996 and construction began in march 1997 aside from the mariners safeco field is also used for amateur baseball events including the washington interscholastic activities association high school state championships and one washington huskies game per

rail line and local metro bus routes via the nearby stadium station historyedit on march 30 1994 king county executive gary locke appointed a task force to assess the need for a new baseball stadium to replace the rapidly deteriorating kingdome many feared that the mariners would leave seattle if a new stadium was not built in january 1995 the 28member task force recommended to the king county council that the public should be involved in the financing of the stadium the task force concluded that a sales tax increase of 01 would be sufficient to fund the stadium king county held a special election in september 1995 asking the public for this sales tax increase the measure was narrowly defeated on october 14 1995 a special session of the state legislature authorized a different funding package for a new stadium that included a food and beverage tax in king county restaurants and bars car rental surcharge in king county a ballpark admissions tax a credit against the state sales tax and sale of a special stadium license plate nine days later the king county council approved the funding package and established the washington state major league baseball stadium public facilities district to own the ballpark and oversee design and construction12 taxpayer suits opposing the legislative actions and the taxes failed in the courts13 on september 9 1996 the site was selected for the new stadium just south of the kingdome in late fall several members of the king county council wrote a letter to the seattle mariners stating that officials consider postponing construction and the opening of the then projected 3845million stadium project14 in response mariners ownership held a news conference stating that they would either sell the team or move the team from seattle after a public outcry the king county council voted to reaffirm their cooperation with the mariners in building a new stadium mariners ownership contributed 145 million to cover cost overruns safeco field under construction in 1998 the kingdome is visible in the background construction officially began on march 8 1997 with a groundbreaking ceremony featuring mariners star ken griffey jr15 the construction overseen by chief financial officer kevin mather16 continued until july 1999 the first game in the new stadium was played on july 15 1999 against the san diego padres the padres won 3–2 before the stadium was initially christened the naming rights to the stadium were sold for advertising seattlebased safeco insurance company paid 40 million for the naming rights for the ballparks first 20 years however the acquisition of the safeco company by bostonbased liberty mutual group has opened the distant possibility that the name could be changed before the contract expires in 2019 however experts speculate this will only happen if liberty mutual retires the safeco name during that time17 when ken griffey jr returned to safeco in 2007 with the cincinnati reds he came to a heros welcome receiving gifts from the mariners organization and fellow former players jay buhner and edgar martínez they unveiled a new poster that declared safeco field the house that griffey built the

acts as an umbrella for the stands and field rather than forming a complete climatecontrolled enclosure as is the case with all other retractable roofs in major league baseball seattles relatively mild climate means the park rarely needs to be heated or cooled but frequent precipitation necessitated a roof the roof is sometimes closed however in dry weather when the temperature is particularly low on cold nights closing the roof helps prevent radiation heat loss the only other covered baseball stadium in the world with permanent openings is the fixedroof seibu dome in tokorozawa saitama japan home of the saitama seibu lions in the open position the roof rests over the bnsf railway tracks that bound the stadium to the east with part of it hanging over the stands in right field this has the effect of echoing the whistles from passing trains into the stadium train whistles were a frequent fixture of the safeco field experience initially but abated significantly when an overpass was built for royal brougham way the street that bounds the stadium to the north which previously crossed the tracks the roof consists of three major sections that extend into the closed position in a telescoping manner with the two outer sections resting under the larger center section each section rests on a set of parallel tracks located on the north and south sides of the stadium with the outer sections moving along the inner set of tracks and the center section moving along the outer set each section is structurally independent ie no section depends on another for structural stability welcome to safeco field seattle is painted on top of the center section visible from aircraft whether the roof is open or closed a lighted safeco field sign was added to the east side of the roof in 2007 which aids in identification of the stadium from the freeways to the east each section is independently powered by electric motors that move the respective sections along the tracks it is controlled from a central control room located under the center field scoreboard depending on wind and weather conditions the roof takes approximately 10 minutes to move from the fully open to the fully closed position and vice versa the roof movement is nearly silent blending in with the ambient noise typically present during a game during normal operation the movement of each section is governed by computers with all three sections moving at the same time during an emergency or maintenance operation each section can be independently moved a working spare motor and wheel assembly for the roof can be found inside the center field gate in its present state it serves to educate visitors on how the roof operates but if needed it can be used to replace a similar part on the roof should
