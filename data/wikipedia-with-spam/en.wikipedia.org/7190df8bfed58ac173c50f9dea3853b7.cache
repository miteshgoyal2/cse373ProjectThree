abusing his 13yearold son jordan the relationship between jackson and jordan had begun in may 1992 chandler initially welcomed and encouraged the friendship and bragged about his connection to a celebrity1 the friendship became well known as the tabloid media reported that jackson became a member of the chandler family in 1993 chandler confronted his exwife june who had custody of jordan with suspicions that their son had been in an inappropriate relationship with jackson but june dismissed his worries23 according to several sources chandler threatened to go public with the evidence he claimed he had on jackson3 who asked his lawyer bert fields to intervene2 chandlers lawyer barry k rothman called psychiatrist mathis abrams and reported a situation of sexual molestation mirroring what his son had alleged abrams then sent rothman a letter on july 15 stating there was reasonable suspicion of sexual abuse and if it had been a real case he would be required by law to contact the los angeles county department of childrens services dcs4 on august 4 chandler and jordan met with jackson and anthony pellicano jacksons private investigator and chandler read out abrams letter he then opened negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement56 on august 16 three days after chandler and rothman had rejected a 350000 offer from jacksons camp junes attorney notified rothman that he would be filing papers next morning to force chandler to return jordan to allow him to go on the asian leg of jacksons dangerous world tour on the day jackson began the third leg of his tour news of the allegations broke to the public and received worldwide media attention jackson ultimately cancelled the remainder of the tour due to health problems arising from the scandal in

that jackson had children sleep over in his bed with him at his neverland ranch a fact which came under much media scrutiny when child sexual abuse allegations were brought against him78 jackson became firm friends with jordan chandler and his family after a meeting in may 1992 as he was a fan of jackson9 their friendship became so close that the national enquirer ran a featured story with the title michaels new adopted family which implied that jackson had stolen the boy from his estranged father evan chandler a dentist who was admittedly jealous over jacksons influence on his son10 according to celebrity biographer j randy taraborrelli chandler asked look are you having sex with my son and after jackson denied doing so chandlers opinion of jackson changed10 jackson invited jordan his stepsister and his mother to visit neverland on the weekends and they would also take trips to las vegas and florida9 these weekend trips began to interfere with jordans scheduled visits with his father with jordan preferring to visit neverland11 in may 1993 when jackson and jordan stayed with chandler he urged jackson to spend more time with his son at his house and even suggested that jackson build an addition onto the house so that jackson could stay there1 after the zoning department told chandler it could not be done he suggested that jackson just build him a new home1 that same month jordan and june flew with jackson to monaco for the world music awards111 according to junes lawyer michael freeman evan began to get jealous of the involvement and felt left out1 upon their return chandler was pleased with a fiveday visit from jackson during which jackson slept in a room with jordan and his stepbrother1 chandler claimed this was when his suspicions of sexual misconduct by jackson began although he admitted that jackson and jordan always had their clothes on when he saw them in bed together and has never claimed to have witnessed any sexual misconduct between the two12 on july 2 1993 in a private telephone conversation chandler was taperecorded as saying there was no reason why he jackson had to stop calling me  i picked the nastiest son of a bitch i could find evan chandlers lawyer barry rothman all he wants to do is get this out in the public as fast as he can as big as he can and humiliate as many people as he can hes nasty hes mean hes smart and hes hungry for publicity everythings going to a certain plan that isnt just mine once i make that phone call this guy is going to destroy everybody in sight in any devious nasty cruel way that he can do it ive given him full authority to do that jackson is an evil guy he is worse than that and i have the evidence to prove it if i go through with this i win bigtime theres no way i lose i will get everything i want and they will be destroyed forever  michaels career will be over13 in the same conversation when asked how this would affect his son chandler replied thats irrelevant to me  it will be a massacre if i dont get what i want its going to be bigger than all us put together  this man jackson is going to be humiliated beyond belief  he will not sell one more record13 the recorded conversation was a critical aspect of jacksons defense against the upcoming allegation made against him he and his supporters argue that he was the victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money from the singer13 in october 1994 mary a fischer of gq magazine reported it was evan chandler who initially accused jackson of molesting his son before he demanded a screenwriting deal from jackson instead of going to the police1415 according to taraborrelli chandler was forced to admit the controversial sedative sodium amytal was used when he extracted a tooth from jordan in early august16 on may 3 1994 kcbstv news reported that chandler claimed the drug was used for tooth extraction and that the allegations came out while jordan was under the influence of the drug5 mark torbiner the dental anesthesiologist who administered the drug told gq if sodium amytal was used it was for dental purposes5 sodium amytal is a barbiturate that puts people in a hypnotic state when injected intravenously studies done in 1952 debunked the drug as a truth serum and demonstrated it enabled false memories to be easily implanted5 dr phillip resnick a noted cleveland psychiatrist17 said it was a psychiatric medication and people will say things under sodium amytal that are blatantly untrue5 in midmay 1994 in napa county california gary ramona won his lawsuit against his daughters therapist and the psychiatrist who had given her sodium amytal518 the psychiatrist claimed the drug helped ramonas daughter remember specific details of sexual molestation by ramona but a court brief written by martin orne a university of pennsylvania psychiatrist who pioneered research of hypnosis and sodium amytal stated that the drug is not useful in ascertaining truth the patient becomes sensitive and receptive to suggestions due to the context and to the comments of the interviewers18 this was the first successful legal challenge to the repressed memory phenomenon5 dr kenneth gottlieb a san francisco psychiatrist said it’s absolutely a psychiatric drugi would never want to use a drug that tampers with a person’s unconscious unless there was no other drug available and i would not use it without resuscitating equipment in case of allergic reaction and only with an md anesthesiologist present5 according to dr john yagiela coordinator of the anesthesia and pain control department of ucla’s school of dentistry it’s unusual for it to be used for pulling a tooth and better safer alternatives are available5 according to diane dimond of hard copy torbiners records show that robinul and vistarol was administered instead of sodium amytal19 the us drug enforcement administration was investigating torbiners administration of drugs in house calls where he mostly gave patients morphine and demerol5 his credentials with the board of dental examiners indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dentalrelated procedures but he had not adhered to those restrictions20 for instance he had given general anesthetic to barry rothman during hairtransplant procedures20 torbiner had introduced chandler and rothman in 1991 when rothman needed dental work5 over the next couple of months both parties engaged in unsuccessful out of court financial negotiations with chandler and his legal team asking for 20 million or the issue would be taken to criminal court6 jackson declined the offer saying no way in hell a few weeks later jacksons legal team gave a counteroffer to the value of 1 million which was declined by chandler6 pellicano said he made the offers he said in an attempt to catch the chandlers negotiating and tape recorded one of the telephone calls to rothman to demonstrate this21 the father then lowered his request to 15 million jackson rejected this and lowered his original counteroffer to 350000 with both sides unable to reach an agreement chandler decided he would take it to court622 chandler then took his son to see a psychiatrist called dr mathis abrams and during the threehour session with the doctor jordan chandler said he had had a sexual relationship with jackson that went on for several months and which included incidents of kissing masturbation and oral sex he then repeated these allegations to police and gave a detailed description of what he alleged was jacksons penis623 allegations made public investigation and la toya jacksonedit on august 18 the los angeles police departments sexually exploited child unit began a criminal investigation on jackson the same day jordan chandlers mother told police that she did not believe jackson had molested her son824 on august 21 a search warrant was issued allowing police to search jacksons neverland ranch police questioned 30 children who were friends of jackson with all stating that jackson was not a child molester724 a police officer involved in the investigation told the los angeles times that no evidence medical photographic or video could be found that would support a criminal filing24 the same day the allegations were made public jackson began the third leg of his dangerous world tour in bangkok on august 24 jacksons investigator held a press conference accusing chandler of trying to extort 20 million from the singer although the investigator failed to mention that jackson had given several counteroffers724 on august 25 jacksons young friends brett barnes and wade robson held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in the same bed as jackson but nothing sexual in nature had occurred2526 jacksons family soon held a press conference of their own to show support saying it was their unequivocal belief that michael had been made a victim of a cruel and obvious attempt to take advantage of his fame and wealth2526 the police then began an investigation into evan chandlers prior actions and found that he was 68400 behind in his child support payments even though he was wellpaid as a dentist9 on november 8 police searched the jackson family home hayvenhurst but found nothing of importance to add to their investigation727 according to internal reports from the la county dcfs at the time chandlers story remained largely consistent but dates places times and some details were inconsistent28 according to reports the dcfs had investigated jackson beginning in august 1993 with the chandler allegation and again in 2003 reports show the lapd and dcfs did not find credible evidence of abuse or sexual misconduct2930 in the winter of 1993 despite not seeing or speaking to jackson for a number of years la toya jackson claimed that her brother was a pedophile and that she had proof which she was prepared to disclose for a fee of 500000 a bidding war between us and uk tabloids began but fell through when they realized that her revelations were not what she had claimed them to be31 then in israel she stated i cannot and will not be a silent collaborator in his crimes against young children  forget about the superstar forget about the icon if he was any other 35yearold man who was sleeping with little boys you wouldnt like this guy31 she also claimed that checks had been made out to several boys and that jacksons own physical abuse as a child had turned him into an abuser3132 she would later claim that jackson had tried to kidnap and kill her32 the rest of the family disowned her and in subsequent years she would insist that she was forced to make the allegations by her then husband for financial gain31 just prior to making the allegations her husband was arrested for striking her in the face arms and legs with a chair33 by the turn of the millennium jackson had forgiven his sister31 lisa marie presley health concerns rehabilitation and elizabeth tayloredit jackson first met lisa marie presley and elvis presley in 1974 during a jackson 5 engagement at the mgm grand25 in november 1992 jackson was reconnected with presley through a mutual friend staying in contact almost every day by telephone34 as the child sexual abuse accusations became public he became dependent on presley for emotional support she was concerned about his faltering health and his addiction to drugs35 she explained i believed he didnt do anything wrong and that he was wrongly accused and yes i started falling for him i wanted to save him i felt that i could do it36 in one phone call he made to her she described him as high incoherent and delusional35 he proposed to her over the phone towards the fall of 1993 saying if i asked you to marry me would you do it35 the marriage was in her words a married couples life that was sexually active37 they divorced fewer than two years later remaining friendly38 jackson had begun taking painkillers valium xanax and ativan to deal with the stress of the allegations made against him35 a few months after the allegations became news he had lost approximately 10 pounds in weight and had stopped eating39 according to jackson he had a tendency to stop eating when really upset or hurt and elizabeth taylor had to make him eat during this ordeal she took the spoon and would put it into my mouth40 he said that he eventually became unconscious and had to be fed intravenously40 in a court deposition unrelated to alleged child abuse he was visibly drowsy lacked concentration and repeatedly slurred while speaking he could not remember the dates of his prior album releases or names of people he had worked with and took several minutes to name some of his recent albums41 his health had deteriorated to the extent that he canceled the remainder of his tour and flew with taylor and her husband to london when jackson arrived at the airport he had to be held up he was then rushed to the home of elton johns manager and afterwards to a clinic2742 but when he was searched for drugs on entry 18 vials of medicine were found in a suitcase jackson booked the whole fourth floor of the clinic and was put on a valium iv to wean him from painkillers82742 the singers spokesperson told reporters that jackson was barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level42 while in the clinic he took part in group and oneonone therapy sessions2742 strip searchedit in december 1993 jackson was served with a warrant for a strip search of his body as police wanted to verify jordan chandlers description of jacksons private anatomy31 the order stated that officers were to examine photograph and videotape jacksons entire body including his penis anus hips buttocks and any other part of his body314344 the warrant stated they were looking for discoloration or any other signs of vitiligo which he had previously spoken about or any other skin disorder and that refusal to comply would be used in court as an indication of guilt43 the strip search took place on december 20 1993 at jacksons ranch those present for the prosecution were santa barbara district attorney tom sneddon a detective a photographer and a doctor those present on behalf of jackson were his two attorneys a physician a detective a bodyguard and a photographer31 the attorneys and sneddon agreed to leave the room when the examination took place and jackson demanded that the prosecution detective should also leave which he subsequently did in an emotional state jackson stood on a platform in the middle of the room took off all his clothes and the search lasted for approximately 25 minutes although he was never physically touched31 reports vary on whether or not the photographs of jackson corroborated chandlers allegations reuters reported that an unidentified source informed them on january 27 1994 that photos of michael jacksons genitalia do not match description given by the boy4546 which was reported in usa today on january 284748 however according to child sexual abuse consultant bill dworin who was one of the lead detectives from the lapd to the allegations jordan chandlers description comported with the photos taken of jacksons genitalia49 dr richard strick who conducted the examination of jacksons genitals stated i was told later that the photos and description absolutely matched50 according to sneddon in a 2005 memorandum in people v jackson the photographs reveal a mark on the right side of defendants penis at about the same relative location as the dark blemish located by jordan chandler on his drawing of defendants erect penis and chandlers graphic representation of the discolored area on defendants penis is substantially corroborated by the photographs51 sneddon ended his declaration with i declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct except for those statements made on information and belief as to those statements i believe them to be true5151 sergeant gary spiegel the sheriff’s photographer claims he observed a dark spot on the lower side of jackson’s penis52 it was reported that jordan chandler claimed that jackson was circumcised153153 jacksons autopsy report reveals that he had not been circumcised and his foreskin appeared naturally intact and showed no signs of having been restored from a circumcision54 taraborrelli claims that jordan correctly noted patchy colored skin on his buttocks short pubic hair and testicles marked pink and brown55 however initially investigators claimed chandler said jackson had splotches on his genitals a color similar to the color of his face rather than pink and brown53 on february 10 199356 jackson had revealed to oprah that he had a skin disorder that destroyed skin pigmentation and left blotches on his skin and that makeup was used to even out his skin57 the live interview was watched by 90 million viewers and after it aired expert information on vitiligo was widely shared in the media57 according to private investigator anthony pellicano who questioned jordan in july 1993 after hearing evans taped phone call jordan denied that he ever saw jacksons body but said he did lift his shirt once to show him the blotches on his skin6 at the behest of a grand jury investigators made a probe into jacksons history including familial interviews to see if he had any surgeries or procedures done to alter his bodys appearance as the jury felt there was a lack of a clear match with jordan chandlers description58 publicized later was an internal report within the lapd and los angeles county dcfs which showed the dcfs had cleared jackson early on of unfounded molestation charges from the chandlers and later from the arvizos in 20035960 jacksons responseedit on december 22 jackson responded to the allegations and everything that had occurred for the first time via satellite from his ranch as you may already know after my tour ended i remained out of the country undergoing treatment for a dependency on pain medicationthere have been many disgusting statements made recently concerning allegations of improper conduct on my part these statements about me are totally falsei will say i am particularly upset by the handling of the mass—matter by the incredible terrible mass media at every opportunity the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions i ask all of you to wait and hear the truth before you label or condemn me dont treat me like a criminal because i am innocent i have been forced to submit to a dehumanizing and humiliating examinationit was the most humiliating ordeal of my life one that no person should ever have to sufferbut if this is what i have to endure to prove my innocence my complete innocence so be it78 — michael jackson a poll at the time conducted by a current affair found that nearly 75 percent of americans believed jackson was telling the truth in his response61 while jackson sought medical help for his faltering health his legal team and friends such as presley and taylor took control of his defense and finances39 much of jacksons legal team would meet three times a week at taylors home to discuss the case39 taylor then called in more legal professionals on jacksons behalf eventually presley taylor and jacksons team all agreed that the singer should settle out of court it was their opinion that the entertainers health had deteriorated to such a degree that he could not endure a lengthy trial42 media reaction and civil suit settlementedit most of the information available on the allegations was released officially or unofficially by the prosecution and unchallenged by jackson15 jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media15 the media bias was evident in the use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline24 the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity62 the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation9 deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst25 using headlines that strongly implied his guilt25 and a general lack of objectivity25 the new york post ran the headline peter pan or pervert despite minimal information being disclosed by the police25 just two weeks after the allegations were reported the headline michael jackson a curtain closes reflected the attitude of most tabloidorientated media63 in a piece for hard copy diane dimond—a journalist who would spend the next 15 years trying to prove jackson was a pedophile—ran a story stating and one more shocker hard copy has obtained new documents in the criminal investigation of michael jackson and they are chilling they contain the name of child movie actor macaulay culkin the document itself stated that culkin strongly denied being harmed by jackson24 two tabloid television shows accepted confidential leaked documents from the los angeles county department of childrens services for 200009 a number of jacksons former employees—most of whom had worked at his ranch—sold stories to the tabloids of alleged prior sexual misconduct on jacksons part instead of reporting their claims to police one couple initially asked for 100000 claiming that jackson sexually caressed macaulay culkin they were prepared to expand upon this allegation for a fee of 500000 whereby they would allege that jackson put his hands down culkins pants when the story broke culkin strongly denied the allegation and did so again in court during the 2003 trial of michael jackson62 a former security guard made various allegations about jackson saying he was fired because he knew too much64 and alleged that he was ordered by jackson to destroy a photo of a naked boy instead of reporting this to police hard copy accepted the story in return for 15000064 afterwards jacksons maid branca francia alleged that she quit in disgust after seeing jackson in a shower with a child but did not inform the police it later emerged that francia was actually fired in 1991 but nevertheless sold her story to hard copy for 2000064 when jackson left the us to go into drug rehabilitation the media showed the singer little sympathy the daily mirror uk held a spot the jacko contest offering readers a trip to disney world if they could correctly predict where the entertainer would appear next27 a daily express headline read drug treatment star faces life on the run while a news of the world headline accused jackson of being a fugitive these tabloids also falsely alleged that jackson had traveled to europe to have cosmetic surgery that would make him unrecognizable on his return27 geraldo rivera set up a mock trial with a jury made up of audience members even though jackson had not been charged with a crime65 a civil lawsuit was filed by jordan chandler and his parents on september 14 199366 in late 1993 district attorneys in santa barbara and los angeles counties both convened grand juries to assess whether criminal charges should be filed against jackson67 by january 1 1994 2 million had been spent by prosecution departments in california and the grand juries had questioned 200 witnesses but jordans allegations could not be corroborated68 on january 4 1994 chandlers attorney larry feldman filed a motion for the photos from jacksons december 1993 body search from investigators saying jacksons attorneys and the la district attorney had refused to give him copies69 a few weeks later feldman petitioned the court that he should be allowed access to jacksons finances over concerns that the singers wealth would give him an unfair advantage in court one adviser to jackson stated you can take pictures of michaels dick and hes not gonna like it but once you start trying to figure out how much money he has thats where he stops playing around68 initially jackson and his lawyers filed a motion for superior court judge david m rothman to postpone the civil case until the criminal investigation was concluded feldman filed a countermotion saying the delay would hurt jordans chances for recovery and make it more difficult to gather evidence70 it is legal to postpone a civil lawsuit past the criminal statute of limitations as a lawsuit can still be filed past that date such as the case of pacers inc v superior court71 also the constitutional right to a speedy trial only applies to criminal cases according to the sixth amendment not civil cases72 on november 23 judge rothman accepted feldmans motion and set march 21 1994 as the start date for the civil trial73 rothman ordered jacksons deposition scheduled before the end of january 1994 but noted he might reconsider if jackson was indicted on criminal charges74 jackson agreed to be deposed on january 1874 his attorneys said he was eager to testify but also said they might oppose the deposition if criminal charges were filed or were still under consideration on his deposition date74 they said if charges were filed they would want the criminal trial to go first74 however when authorities notified jacksons lawyers that they expected their investigation to continue at least through february jacksons team still failed to win a delay of the civil case75 jacksons lawyers also lost a motion to prevent feldman from turning over information eg from the civil deposition to prosecutors pursuing possible criminal charges75 the concerns about a civil trial during an ongoing criminal investigation and about the prosecutors access to the plaintiffs information in the civil trial stemmed from jacksons fifth amendment rights72 as two grand juries had deemed there was insufficient evidence for charges as of january 168 the prosecution might have been able to form the elements of a criminal case around the defense strategy in the civil trial creating a situation akin to double jeopardy7677 for instance prosecutor tom sneddon altered fundamental elements of his case in 2004 after evidence undermining the arvizo familys 2003 allegations appeared after jacksons initial arraignment78 upon discovery of two taped interviews in which the arvizo family praised jackson and denied any abuse sneddon introduced a conspiracy charge and claimed they were forced to lie against their will78 and when jackson was rearraigned in april 2004 for the conspiracy charge the dates of the alleged molestation on the charge sheet had been shifted by almost two weeks78 jacksons lawyer mark geragos had announced on nbc in january 2004 that his client had a concrete ironclad alibi for the dates on the charge sheet78 on january 24 1994 prosecutors announced that they would be not bringing charges against evan chandler for attempted extortion as jacksons camp has been slow to report the extortion claim to the police and had tried to negotiate a settlement with chandler for several weeks79 evan had first made his demand for a financial settlement on august 4 1993 and the jackson camp filed extortion charges against evan and his attorney barry k rothman in late august 199380 after tape recordings supporting the extortion claim were released to the media on august 3081 a lawyer for jackson explained they had not gone to the police earlier because it was our hope that this would all go away we tried to keep it as much inhouse as we could82 jackson had already experienced years of bizarre rumors and speculation82 in the extortion investigation a search warrant was never sought to search the homes and offices of evan chandler and barry rothman and no grand jury was convened when both men declined to be interviewed by police67 in contrast the police searched jacksons residences solely based on jordans allegations reported by a psychiatrist with no particular expertise in child sexual abuse8384 and increased their efforts to investigate jackson after no supporting evidence was found in their raids and after questioning almost 30 children jacksons phonebooks were seized and their families all of whom said jackson had done nothing wrong8083 officers flew to the philippines to interview two exhousekeepers who had sold a molestation story to the tabloids but decided it lacked credibility80 several parents also complained to one of jacksons attorneys of aggressive investigative techniques by the police allegedly frightening their children with lies eg ‘we have nude photos of you to pressure them into accusing jackson7080 and unequivocally telling parents their children had been molested even though their children had denied being victimized80 on january 25 199485 the chandlers lawsuit was settled out of court with 15331250 to be held in a trust fund for jordan86 15 million for each of his parents and the familys lawyer slated to receive 5 million for a total of approximately 23 million87 although another source showed feldman was to receive 3 million based on a september 1993 retainer for a total of 21 million88 according to a motion passed to judge melville in 2004 leading up to the 2005 trial evan chandler himself is the one who initiated the settlement with jacksons insurer89 jacksons insurance company negotiated and paid the settlement over the protests of mr jackson and his personal legal counsel and was the source of the settlement amounts as noted in a 2005 memorandum in people v jackson90 it also noted an insurance carrier has the right to settle claims covered by insurance where it decides settlement is expedient and the insured may not interfere with nor prevent such settlements as established by a number of precedents in california90 defeating the right would involve convincing a court with the power to overrule the precedent that the earlier decision was either wrongly decided or more often clearly wrong depending on the criteria of the court91 or the court must be convinced to distinguish the case92 that is to make the ruling narrower than that in the precedent due to some difference in facts between the current and precedent case while still supporting the result reached in the earlier case92 in 2004 jacksons attorney thomas mesereau in people v jackson said people who intended to earn millions of dollars from his record and music promotions did not want negative publicity from these lawsuits interfering with their profits michael jackson now regrets making these payments these settlements were entered into with one primary condition – that condition was that mr jackson never admitted any wrongdoing mr jackson always denied doing anything wrongmr jackson now realizes the advice he received was wrong93 jackson explained why had he tried to settle i wanted to go on with my life too many people had already been hurt i want to make records i want to sing i want to perform againits my talent my hard work my life my decision68 he also wanted to avoid a media circus94 closure of the criminal investigationedit although some perceive the settlement as an admission of guilt the settlement agreement specifically stated that jackson admitted no wrongdoing and no liability8795 and legally a settlement cannot be used as evidence of guilt in future civil and criminal cases96 the settlement payment was for alleged personal injuries arising out of claims of negligence and not for claims of intentional or wrong acts of sexual molestation8897 in the settlement both parties agreed they would not speak about the case details in public but it did not prevent the chandlers from testifying in a criminal trial or sharing information with authorities in a criminal investigation98 the settlement document adamantly states there is no admission of wrongdoing on jacksons part and no admission of molestation or immodesty98 and that under no circumstances shall any payment be withheld from the complainants even if they were to testify against jackson98 the chandlers lawyer mr feldman explicitly stated nobody bought anybodys silence99 bribery to not testify in a trial is a felony according to california penal code 138100 receiving such a bribe is also a felony according to this law100 district attorney gil garcetti stated the settlement didnt affect criminal prosecution of the molestation allegations the criminal investigation of singer michael jackson is ongoing and will not be affected by the announcement of the civil case settlement101 jordan chandler was interviewed after the settlement by detectives seeking evidence of child molestation but no criminal charges were filed as a result of that interview102 a santa barbara county grand jury disbanded on may 2 1994 without indicting jackson while a los angeles county grand jury continued to investigate the sexual abuse allegations103104 after which time the chandlers stopped cooperating with the criminal investigation around july 6 1994105 the police never pressed criminal charges94 citing a lack of evidence without jordans testimony the state closed its investigation on september 22 199468106 according to the grand juries the evidence presented by the santa barbara police and the lapd was not convincing enough to indict jackson or subpoena him68103 even though grand juries can indict the accused purely on hearsay evidence107108 according to a 1994 report by variety a source in contact with the grand juries stated none of the witnesses so far have offered anything that would directly implicate the singer73 according to a report in 1994 by showbiz today one of the 1994 grand jurors claimed they did not hear any damaging testimony during the hearings109 aftermathedit a week after the settlement of the chandlers lawsuit was announced on january 25 1994110 la district attorney gil garcetti announced he supported amending a law that prohibits forcing people who say they have been sexually assaulted to testify in criminal proceedings111112 the amendment introduced into the state assembly the week of february 7 would have immediately allowed garcetti to compel jordan to testify112 around that time santa barbara police interviewed the 13yearold son of one of jacksons former maids who had told them her son had spent time with jackson and then arranged for him to see a therapist after he repeatedly denied being abused111 in a deposition his mother stated when she asked the police about who she could speak to about her concerns about their meetings and phone conversations with her son without her present they arranged for her and her son to see separate therapists111112 on april 11 1994 the grand jury session in santa barbara was extended for an additional 90day term to allow sneddon to gather more evidence and prosecution sources admitted to being frustrated in their grand jury probe failing to find direct evidence of the molestation charges113 the final grand jury ultimately disbanded without ever returning an indictment against jackson114 three years later jordan chandlers alleged account of the relationship was detailed in a book by journalist victor m gutierrez the book was said to be based on a diary the boy had kept at the time and included details of alleged sexual encounters between jackson and him7 in 1995 jackson filed a civil suit against gutierrez for slander the jury found in jacksons favor awarding him 27 million in damages however that suit was unrelated to the book and the judgement does not serve to refute the allegations contained within115 in 1996 evan chandler sued jackson for around 60 million claiming jackson had breached an agreement never to discuss the case in 1999 a court ruled in jacksons favor and threw out the lawsuit7 but the 1993 case would be revisited again with the 2003 allegations there was more than a year between jacksons 2003 arrest and the beginning of his trial and he was prevented by a gag order from responding to any stories in the media78 as in 1993 there were leaked documents eg jordan chandlers 1993 police statement78 the media was again eager to report on the allegations with a tendency for sensationalism and allegations sold to tabloid tv shows by disgruntled exemployees in the 1990s were constantly in the news again78 also similar to 1993 details of the arvizo familys 2003 allegations were leaked78 these stories were mostly reported as allegations rather than facts but the volume and frequency of stories combined with jacksons inability to refute them had a devastating impact on public opinion of him78 in a 2005 lecture at harvard after jacksons trial jacksons attorney thomas mesereau said the following about jordan chandler the prosecutors tried to get him to show up and he wouldnt if he had i had witnesses who were going to come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say it turned out hed gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents78 in 2006 jordan accused evan of attacking him with a barbell choking him and spraying his face with mace the charges were later dropped116 on november 5 2009 fourteen weeks after jacksons death evan chandler was found dead following an apparent suicide117 music journalist charles thomson noted a continued media bias against jackson after the chandler suicide thomson said he was contacted by a british tabloid to supply information about the 1993 allegations only to have them replace his carefully researched information with the common myths he advised them to avoid15 and that the same misinformation was in every article he read about the suicide15 he noted when jacksons fbi file was released the following month the contents were portrayed by the media as giving an impression of guilt even though the file strongly supported his innocence15 he noted how gene simmons allegations in 2010 about jackson molesting children received over a hundred times more coverage than his interview with jacksons longtime guitarist jennifer batten who rebutted simmons claims15 effect on jacksons careeredit jacksons commercial appeal and public image declined in the wake of the case the album released prior to the allegations was dangerous the album stands as one of the worlds bestselling records118119 the albums appeal meant that singles were still being released through 1993 at the time of the allegations and jackson was still traveling the world on his dangerous world tour the last charting single from dangerous was the ballad gone too soon released in december 1993 and dedicated to the memory of jacksons friend ryan white a teenager from kokomo indiana who came to national attention after being expelled from his school for having hivaids a rumored tenth single release of the title track dangerous was canceled120 the government of dubai barred jackson from performing in response to an anonymous pamphlet campaign that attacked him as immoral121 after performing 24 shows of the third leg of the dangerous tour jackson canceled the remainder of the tour to seek treatment for his pain medication addictions pepsico stopped all promotional activities with jackson ending their tenyear partnership jacksons fans responded by boycotting the company41 jackson had contracted to create a new horrorthemed song and video that would be crosspromoted with the film addams family values he was unable to finish shooting the video and his song was dropped from the soundtrack122 a brand of hisandhers fragrances was canceled because of jacksons drug problems at the time123 a spokesman for the marketing group behind the fragrance deal called it somewhat of a fiasco124 his next studio album was history released in the summer of 1995 jackson also produced a special show for cablenetwork hbo titled for one night only with the show to be recorded in front of a special invited audience at new york citys beacon theater on december 8 and 9 1995 for transmission on hbo on december 10 however the shows were canceled after jackson collapsed at the theater on december 6 during rehearsals jackson was admitted overnight to beth israel medical center north the shows and the hbo special were never rescheduled the following year jackson began the history world tour despite the shows success jacksons only concerts in the usa were two shows performed at the aloha stadium in honolulu hawaii jackson never performed another world tour125 the allegations also had an effect on the content of jacksons music history which was released shortly after the allegations creates an atmosphere of paranoia according to one writer126 its content focuses on the public struggles jackson went through just prior to its production in the songs scream and tabloid junkie along with the ballad you are not alone jackson directs much of his anger and personal hurt at the media127 in the track ds jackson launches a verbal attack against a character who is often cited to be tom sneddon the district attorney that requested his strip search he describes the person as an antisocial white supremacist who wanted to get my ass dead or alive of the song sneddon said i have not shall we say done him the honor of listening to it but i’ve been told that it ends with the sound of a gunshot128 in the introspective ballad stranger in moscow jackson laments his swift and sudden fall from grace126127 he completed the video that was originally supposed to accompany addams family values and released it as ghosts the finished video included a framing story about an eccentric maestro who entertains children and is pursued by a bigoted local official129 jacksons last album invincible was released six years later in 2001 his longest period between full studio records following a conflict between jackson and his record label sony music stopped promoting the album invincible would go on to be seen as a relative commercial disappointment when compared to jacksons prior solo material although it sold 13 million copies worldwide130 as part of jacksons contract with sony a number of compilations of greatest hits packaged with previously unreleased material were released including number ones in 2003 the 4cd1dvd box set the ultimate collection in 2004 and doublealbum the essential michael jackson in 2005 new agreements between sony and michael jackson saw the release of the singles collection visionary the video singles in 2006 a 25th anniversary edition of thriller in 2008 and jacksons final release before his death – the king of pop album celebrating michaels 50th birthday with tracks voted for by fans people v jacksonedit main article people v jackson jacksons 2003 arrest photograph a fan showing support for jackson in 2003 on december 18 2003 jackson was formally charged with seven counts of child sexual abuse and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent in order to commit a child sexual abuse felony against gavin arvizo131 earlier that year a granada television documentary called living with michael jackson showed the pop star holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with arvizo132 jackson denied these allegations saying that the sleepovers were in no way sexual in nature sneddon again led the effort to prosecute jackson133 these prosecutions led to complaints that sneddon was motivated by a vendetta against jackson evidence to support these claims include sneddon joking about jacksons greatest hits album being released on the same day as his arrest and saying like the sheriff and i really are into that kind of music he then proceeded to call jackson wacko jacko and shouting we got him we finally got him to the media when he had only just began an investigation and had gathered limited information or evidence133134 the people v jackson trial began in santa maria california on january 31 2005135 during the trial the judge allowed testimony about past allegations including the 1993 case to establish whether the defendant had a propensity to commit certain crimes94136 however jordan chandler had left the country to avoid testifying78 in a lecture at harvard after the trial thomas mesereau said the prosecutors tried to get him to show up and he wouldnt if he had i had witnesses who were going to come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say it turned out hed gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents78 june chandler testified that she hadnt spoken to her son in 11 years at one point in her testimony she claimed that she couldnt remember being sued by jackson78 who had countersued for extortion and at another point said that shed never heard of her own attorney78 however she said she never witnessed any molestation78 jackson was found unanimously not guilty of all charges by the jury on june 13 200578 2013 child molestation allegationsedit on may 1 2013 a lawyer for choreographer wade robson filed a complaint against the michael jackson estate for childhood sexual abuse howard weitzman the lawyer for jacksons estate called robsons accusations outrageous and pathetic137138 robson appeared on the today show on may 16 2013 to discuss the allegations robson told interviewer matt lauer that jackson was a pedophile and a child sexual abuser who performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him over a sevenyear period beginning in 1990 when robson was seven years old when he visited jacksons neverland ranch for the first time139 in a 1993 deposition robsons mother joy robson said that jackson had special friends boys with whom he spent extra time with that he replaced each year and that wade was jacksons special friend in 1990140 in august 1993 after the allegations against jackson were made public wade robson and jacksons other special friend brett barnes held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in jacksons bed but nothing sexual had occurred141 robson said in the today show interview that his denial of wrongdoing on jacksons part during the 1993 investigation was a result of jacksons complete manipulation and brainwashing of him robson alleged that at the time jackson would call me every day and role play and tell me the same sort of things and also tell me then that if anyone ever thought that we did these things any of these sexual things that both of us would go to jail for the rest of our lives robson was also a star witness for jacksons defense at his 2005 trial he said that his change of story was provoked by becoming a father and experiencing nervous breakdowns in 2011 and 2012142 robson filed an amended complaint on july 1 2013 which stated the longterm psychological consequences of jackson’s threats sexual trauma and mental manipulation imprisoned robson’s mind and prevented him from filing a timely claim just as effectively as if he had been physically imprisoned143 on june 2 2014 the trial for robsons lawsuit against jacksons estate for childhood sexual abuse began144145 on august 4 2014 james safechuck filed court papers against jacksons estate which alleged that jackson abused him after he appeared alongside him in a pepsi commercial howard weitzman attorney for the mj estate stated the whole lawsuit should be scrapped because this is a person who made his claim five years after michael jackson has passed away more than 20 years after the incidents supposedly happened and who has given sworn testimony that michael never did anything inappropriate to him in 1993 and stated that this was just an attempt from safechuck to recover money from jacksons beneficiaries that should be rejected146147 the lawsuit was dismissed may 26 2015 by a los angeles judge who ruled that robson waited too long to seek legal action superior court judge mitchell beckloff wrote in his decision that robson could file a lawsuit only for a reasonable time period after any violence intimidation or threatening conduct by the decedent ceases 148 wades trialdate in his lawsuit against mjj productions and mjj ventures is set for march 2018149 while safechucks case is still pending robsons lawyer stated that jackson operated the most sophisticated child sexual abuse procurement and facilitation operation the world has known and that while his companies were supposedly dedicated to creating and distributing michael jacksons music and entertainment it actually served a dual purpose and that was locating producing and enabling his sexual abuse of kids the lawyer for jacksons estate howard weitzman stated that my opinion is that summary judgment will be granted in this case and there won’t be any trial but the court did set a trial date for a year away just in case150 on october 18 2016 an anonymous woman sued michael jacksons estate mjj productions and mjj ventures alleging she had been sexuallyabused by jackson when she was 1215 from 19861989 in jacksons encino home hotels the smooth criminal set the moonwalker movie set in the back of his limousine his neverland ranch and an apartmentcondo he nicknamed the hideout she provided letters love notes allegedly written by jackson multiple gifts apparently given by jackson a jacket he supposedly gave to her after an album photoshoot checks given to her from 19901993 totaling 920000 sent from michael jackson mjj ventures and mjj productions—coming directly from jacksons backaccounts and a 1993 santa barbara pd letter alleging that the police department concluded she knew all about child abuse to come in and speak to them regarding their investigation her complaint alleges that she never considered her emotionalpsychological injuries to be a result of her sexual activities with jackson until she reflected on those experiences for the first time in september 2016 and that even if she had wanted to she couldnt possibly come forward earlier because she was threatened with physical harm if she ever told anyone told that she would get in trouble with law enforcement and go to jail if she did and that jackson made her promise not to tell anyone a lawyer for the businesses dismissed the allegations saying this is yet another attempt to hit the lottery by suing the estate of michael jackson more than seven years after michaels death and close to 30 years after these incidents supposedly occurred we believe this claim was created from whole cloth and is without any merit its also no coincidence that this woman is represented by the same attorneys involved in two other frivolous claims against the estate151152 referencesedit a b c d e f fischer p 217 a b fischer p 218 a b fischer
