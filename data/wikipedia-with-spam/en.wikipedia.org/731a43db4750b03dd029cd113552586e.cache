grant started a british fan club in 1988 and then jackson invited him out to los angeles when he was recording dangerous within a few years the fan club had grown to 25000 subscribed members this led to an annual michael jackson tribute show in the uk from 1991 jackson attended the tenth anniversary event each tribute show attracted anywhere from 1000 to 3000 people grant also wrote three books including michael jackson – the visual documentary which was approved by the singer jackson was never involved with the production of thriller – live but he wished grant luck with the production567 productionsedit in august 2006 thriller – live was previewed in the uk at the dominion theatre the show was originally directed and choreographed by kerys nathan and with additional choreography by lavelle smith jnr56 the following year grant backed by flying music began production for a uk tour featuring the talents of shaheen jafargholi depicting the young michael in the jackson 5 the adult singers included pop idol star zoe birkett and filipinoaustralian vocalist mig ayesa the show played a successful set of dates throughout may and june 2007 and later that year it toured in europe7

avenue tito jackson other celebrities attended the premiere la toya jackson attended the after show party1489101112 thriller – live was originally scheduled to run until 16 may 2009 but this date was extended several times following wide public interest especially after jacksons death on june 25 200913 in september 2014 it became the 20th longestrunning musical in west end14 thriller – live played in singapore at the marina bay sands grand theater in may 201115 commentaryedit karen fricker of variety expressed the opinion that the musical had remarkably high production value but was too long fricker continued jacksons hits sung by four strongvoiced charismatic leads backed by a crackerjack team of singerdancers—is effective and entertaining3 sanjoy roy of the guardian observed its cute kicking and retro but also highlights a danger that looms large in this show that even as a tot jackson was supremely gifted performer—both as a singer and a dancer—and this tribute however well intended inevitably pales by comparison2 paul vale of the stage stated those looking for history of jacksons personal life should look elsewhere as this theatrical extravaganza is a breathtaking celebration of a musician whose work spans over three decades jonathan parks set design and nigel catmurs lighting are complimented sic by led screens creating some wonderful theatrical set pieces that are simple and yet remarkably effective9 benedict nightingale of the times said of one performer what he lacks in physical similarity to jackson he also lacks vocally the coarse sandy qualities of his voice are as suited to rock with you as custard is on a steak16 charles spencer of the daily telegraph commented gary lloyd who doubles as director and choreographer keeps the energy level at fever pitch almost throughout and his dance routines featuring daring leaps from an onstage bridge breakdancing and yes the moonwalk are spectacular there is also a terrific band ranging with aplomb from funk soul and disco through candyrush pop to guitarled rock17 malcolm jack of the scotsman noted that some of jacksons best numbers dont stop til you get enough wanna be startin somethin and beat it were treated rather underwhelmingly but the faithfulish to the video centrepieces smooth criminal billie jean and thriller were fairly spectacular18 amber windsor of this is local london said of her experience at one show the signature highpitched yee hee echoed from the foyer and it was endearing to see a young boy recreating michaels signature moonwalk proving jacksons music still appeals to all agesthe stage was vibrantly brought to life by the dancers easily the strongest element of thriller live their endless energy and clear passion for the music reflected jacksons own style19 mel bradley of dinnington guardian recalled his enthusiasm and enjoyment while observing the musical despite not being an ardent fan of the king of pop20 julie carpenter of daily express stated this is a hugely enjoyable gloriously upbeat highenergy show which leaves you chanting annie are you ok are you ok annie as you slip out the door21 fiona mountford of the daily mail noted that the script could have been written on two pages of a4 but described the dancers as astoundingly agile and the show a slick package22 on june 21 2010 six performers in the london cast released speechless as a single to commemorate the oneyear anniversary of jacksons death all proceeds from the recording were donated to the charity war child23 setlistedit act i overture history opening mashup dont stop til you get
