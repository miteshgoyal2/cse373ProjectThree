and googlewashing refer to the practice of causing a web site to rank highly in web search engine results for irrelevant unrelated or offtopic search terms by linking heavily in contrast search engine optimization seo is the practice of improving the search engine listings of web pages for relevant search terms googlebombing is done for either business political or comedic purposes or some combination thereof1 googles searchrank algorithm ranks pages higher for a particular search phrase if enough other pages linked to it use similar anchor text by january 2007 however google tweaked its search algorithm to counter popular google bombs such as miserable failure leading to george w bush and michael moore now search results list pages about the google bomb itself2 as of january 2016update the first result in a google search for miserable failure is the wikipedia article defining google bomb used both as a verb and a noun google bombing was introduced to the new oxford american dictionary in may 20053 google bombing is related to spamdexing the practice of deliberately modifying html to increase the chance of their website being placed close to the beginning of search engine results or to influence the category to which the page is assigned in a misleading or dishonest manner4 the term googlewashing was coined by andrew orlowski in 2003 to describe the use of media manipulation to change the perception of a term or push out competition from search engine results pages serps56 contents 1 history 2 uses as tactical media 3 alternative meanings 4 google bowling 5 other search engines 6 motivations 61 competitions 62 political activism 63 commercial use 631 quixtars bomb 632 godaddy bomb 633 other examples of google bombs 7 see also 8 references 81 news articles historyedit google bombs date back as far as 1999 when a search for more evil than satan himself resulted in the microsoft homepage as the top result7 in september 2000 the first google bomb with a verifiable creator was created by hugedisk mens magazine a nowdefunct online humor magazine when it linked the text dumb motherfucker to a site selling george w bushrelated merchandise8 hugedisk had also unsuccessfully attempted to google bomb an equally derogatory term to bring up an al gorerelated site after a fair amount of publicity the george w bushrelated merchandise site retained lawyers and sent a ceaseanddesist letter to hugedisk thereby ending the google bomb9 adam mathes is credited with coining the term google bombing when he mentioned it in an april 6 2001 article in the online magazine ubernu in the article mathes details his connection of the search term talentless hack to the website of his friend andy pressman by recruiting fellow webloggers to link to his friends page with the desired term10 some experts forecast that the practice of google bombing is over as changes to googles algorithm over the years have minimised the effect of the technique11 uses as tactical mediaedit the google bomb has been used for tactical media as a way of performing a hitandrun media attack on popular topics such attacks include anthony coxs attack in 2003 he created a parody of the 404 – page not found browser error message in response to the war in iraq the page looked like the error page but was titled these weapons of mass destruction cannot be displayed this website could be found as one of the top hits on google after the start of the war in iraq12 also in an attempt to detract attention from the rightwing group english defence league edl a parody group has been made known as english disco lovers with the expressed purpose of google bombing the acronym13 alternative meaningsedit the google bomb is often misunderstood by those in the media and publishing industry who do not retain technical knowledge of googles ranking factors for example talk radio host alex jones has often conducted what he calls google bombs by dispatching instructions to his radiointernet listeners1415 in this context the term is used to describe a rapid and massive influx of keyword searches for a particular phrase the keyword surge gives the impression that the related content has suddenly become popular the strategy behind this type of google bombing is to attract attention from the larger mainstream media and influence them to publish content related to the keywordcitation needed google bowlingedit by studying what types of ranking manipulations a search engine is using a company can provoke a search engine into lowering the ranking of a competitors website this practice known as google bowling is often done by purchasing google bombing services or other seo techniques not for ones own website but rather for that of a competitor the attacker provokes the search company into punishing the offending competitor by displaying their page further down in the search results1617 for victims of google bowling it may be difficult to appeal the ranking decrease because google avoids explaining penalties preferring not to educate real offenders if the situation is clearcut however google could lift the penalty after submitting a request for reconsideration furthermore after the google penguin update google search rankings now take google bowling into account and according to various sources very rarely will a website be penalized due to lowquality farm backlinks other search enginesedit other search engines use similar techniques to rank results so yahoo bing and askcom are also affected by google bombs a search for miserable failure or failure on september 29 2006 brought up the official george w bush biography number one on google yahoo and msn and number two on askcom on june 2 2005 tooter reported that george bush was ranked first for the keyword miserable failure and miserable failure in both google and yahoo google has since addressed this and disarmed the george bush google bomb and many others the bbc reporting on google bombs in 2002 used the headline google hit by link bombers18 acknowledging to some degree the idea of link bombing in 2004 search engine watch suggested that the term be link bombing because of its application beyond google and continues to use that term as it is considered more accurate19 we dont condone the practice of googlebombing or any other action that seeks to affect the integrity of our search results but were also reluctant to alter our results by hand in order to prevent such items from showing up pranks like this may be distracting to some but they dont affect the overall quality of our search service whose objectivity as always remains the core of our mission — 20 by january 2007 google changed its indexing structure2 so that google bombs such as miserable failure would typically return commentary discussions and articles about the tactic itself2 google announced the changes on its official blog in response to criticism for allowing the google bombs matt cutts head of googles webspam team said that google bombs had not been a very high priority for us221 over time we’ve seen more people assume that they are googles opinion or that google has handcoded the results for these googlebombed queries thats not true and it seemed like it was worth trying to correct that misperception — 22 motivationsedit this section may require

controversy around the internet as some groups worried that search engine optimization seo companies would abuse the techniques used in the competition to alter queries more relevant to the average user this fear was offset by the belief that google would alter their algorithm based on the methods used by the google bombers in september 2004 another seo contest was created this time the objective was to get the top result for the phrase seraphim proudleduck a large sum of money was offered to the winner but the competition turned out to be a hoaxcitation needed in march 2005s issue

other techniques posting of links to a site in an internet forum along with phrases the promoter hopes to associate with the site see spam in blogs unlike conventional message board spam the object is not to attract readers to the site directly but to increase the sites ranking under those search terms promoters using this technique frequently target forums with low reader traffic in hopes that it will fly under the moderators radar wikis in particular are often the target of this kind of page rank vandalism as all of the pages are freely editable this practice was also called money bombing by john hiler circa 20046162 another technique is for the owner of an internet domain name to set up the domains dns entry so that all subdomains are directed to the same server the operator then sets up the server so that page requests generate a page full of desired google search terms each linking to a subdomain of the same site with the same title as the subdomain in the requested url frequently the subdomain matches the linked phrase with spaces replaced by underscores or hyphens since google treats subdomains as distinct sites the effect of many subdomains linking to each other is a boost to the pagerank of those subdomains and of any other site they link to on february 2 2007 many have noticed changes in the google algorithm that largely affects among other things google bombs only
