consumer shows along with sporting events located within a mile 16 km of downtown seattle the stadium is accessible by multiple freeways and forms of mass transit the stadium was built between 2000 and 2002 on the site of the kingdome after voters approved funding for the construction in a statewide election held in june 1997 this vote created the washington state public stadium authority to oversee public ownership of the venue the owner of the seahawks paul allen formed first goal inc to develop and operate the new facilities allen was closely involved in the design process and emphasized the importance of an openair venue with an intimate atmosphere the crowd is notoriously loud during seahawks games it has twice held the guinness world record for loudest crowd roar at an outdoor stadium first at 1366 decibels in 2013 followed by a measurement of 1376 decibels in 2014 both records were eventually broken by crowds at arrowhead stadium in kansas city missouri the current record was set by fans at arrowhead on september 29 2014 in a monday night football game against the new england patriots hitting 1422 decibels5678 the noise has contributed to the teams home field advantage with an increase in false start movement by an offensive player prior to the play and delay of game failure of the offense to snap the ball prior to the play clock expiring penalties against

the facility the proposal failed and as a result seahawks owner ken behring threatened to sell or move the team in 1997 local billionaire paul allen pledged to acquire the team if a new stadium could be built and said that the team could not be profitable until they left the kingdome he asked the state legislature to hold a special statewide referendum on a proposal to finance a new stadium allen also agreed to cover any cost overruns1213 with allen agreeing to pay the 4 million cost the legislature agreed the vote was scheduled to be held in june 1997 but in may a seattle resident filed a lawsuit that claimed the legislature did not have authority to call for such a vote since it would be paid for by a private party who could gain from the result the case was delayed until after the vote14 the proposal was pitched to voters as providing both a new home for the seahawks and a venue for toplevel soccer it passed on june 17 199715 with 820364 511 in favor and 783584 against1416 the vote was close in seattle but it received 60 approval in seattles northern and eastern suburbs the public funding was unpopular farther away in the eastern portion of the state17 in october a thurston county superior court judge ruled that the legislature acted properly and in the publics interest and he dismissed the pending lawsuit the washington supreme court upheld the decision that december1418 voter approval of the referendum created a public–private partnership15 the washington state public stadium authority was created to oversee public ownership of the stadium exhibition center and parking garage complex allen purchased the seahawks and formed first goal inc to build and operate the facility the budget for the project was 430 million of this cost 44 million was allotted to build the event center 26 million for the parking garage and 360 million for the stadium first goal was to cover cost overruns and pay up to 130 million of the project while the contribution from the public was capped at 300 million19 the public funding package included new sportsrelated state lottery games taxes on the facilitys admissions and parking sales tax credits and deferrals and an eightyear extension of the 2 tax on hotel rooms in king county20 the taxes on admissions and parking are set at 2 to pay off the projects taxexempt bonds those taxes will be kept below the authorized 10 to preserve the taxexempt status but the percentage will be increased to the full amount when the bonds are completely paid in 2021 at such time they will become dedicated funding sources for maintenance and modernization of the facilities19 in september 1998 first goal signed a 30year stadium lease that includes options to extend for another 2021 per the agreement the public stadium authority receives 850000 a year from first and goal adjusted for inflation and first goal keeps all revenue from the stadium and parking garage the company receives 80 of the revenue from the exhibition center while the other twenty percent is allotted to a state education fund first goal is responsible for all operating and maintenance costs expected to be 6 million a year and must keep the facility in firstclass condition other details of the lease include the availability of affordable seats a coordinated effort with neighboring safeco field to prevent gridlock a provision for naming rights the investment in public art at the stadium and the giveaway of a luxury suite to a fan each seahawks game21 construction and layoutedit the stadium under construction in 2001 the architectural firm ellerbe becket in association with loschky marquardt nesholm architects of seattle designed the 1500000 sq ft 140000 m2 project allen was closely involved during the design process while growing up he attended games at the university of washingtons outdoor husky stadium his goal was to create a similar experience and atmosphere at the new venue2223 the exhibition center portion of the project was designed over a period of 14 months by loschky marquardt nesholm architects while first goal managed the construction2425 town meetings were held to discuss the impact on the public and the company created a 6 million mitigation fund for nearby neighborhoods26 in accordance with a program established by the building team contracts totaling 81 million were awarded to minority and womenowned businesses union apprentices made up 19 of the workforce through another program with local trade unions27 in september 1998 construction began on the new exhibition center and parking garage by october 1999 the exhibition center was open and hosting events24 on march 26 2000 to make way for the stadium the kingdome was demolished in the worlds largest implosion of a single concrete structure28 almost all of the kingdome rubble was recycled with roughly half used for the new stadium the designers were challenged by the soft soil at the site since it was a tidal marsh until public works projects in the early 20th century adjusted the waterline of nearby elliott bay the top layer is a soft fill taken from the grading projects that had leveled portions of seattles hills to account for the soft soil the complex sits on over 2200 pilings driven 50 to 70 ft 15 to 21 m below the ground to form what is essentially a pier for the foundation29 eight individually connected sections were built to account for the soil concerns temperature effects and the potential for earthquakes30 the adjoining exhibition center and parking garage are separate structures and are not part of the eightsection stadium30 the stadium after completion in 2002 the site of centurylink field is the smallest of those developed for new nfl stadiums31 the upper levels were cantilevered over the lower sections to fit within the limited space along with the angle of seats and the placement of the lower sections closer to the field this provided a better view of the field than typically seen throughout the country and allowed for a 67000seat capacity32 space is available to increase the total capacity to 72000 for special events included in the capacity are 111 suites and over 7000 club seats the stadium has 1400 seats for those with disabilities and their companions located in various sections32 in 2009 centurylink field ranked 21st out of the 31 stadiums in the nfl for total seating capacity33 the configuration of centurylink field is a ushape with an open north end to provide views of downtown seattle and the large north plaza the large retractable roof of safeco field along with mount rainier to the southeast can be seen from the partially open south end31 the stadiums concourses were built to be wide and they provide additional views of the surrounding area34 a 13story tower was erected at the north end of the stadium that visually complements the seattle skyline35 the tower features a vertically oriented scoreboard which is the first of its kind in the nfl at the base is bleacher seating for 3000 called the hawks nest another addition not previously seen in the nfl are fieldlevel luxury suites located directly behind the north end zone31 the roofs of centurylink field and safeco field allen rejected plans for a retractable roof during the early stages of the stadiums design the lack of a retractable roof made it open to the elements provided better views and reduced the total cost of the project31 the roof at 200000 sq ft 19000 m236 covers 70 of the seats but leaves the field open27 the roof spans 720 ft 220 m between concrete pylon supports at the north and south ends of the stadium its two expansive sections are held from below by trusses37 from above two arches with additional supports rise 200 ft 61 m over the field36 posttensioned cables were used to achieve its final shape and positioning38 to minimize damage in the event of an earthquake the roof has a friction pendulum damper system this disconnects the roof from the support pylons so that it can move independently of the structure the technology had never been applied to a largescale roof before centurylink field30 the roof was originally painted white to aesthetically distinguish it from both safeco field and the nearby industrial area35 the east side of the stadium has a large glass curtain wall that faces the nearby international district the exterior of the stadium also consists of salmoncolored concrete and the west side of the structure is partially clad with red brick the coloring and facade were designed so the stadium would blend with the older buildings in neighboring pioneer square to reduce costs the exterior was not completed with brick or ornate steel work31 a 68magnitude earthquake struck the seattle area during construction the structure responded as expected by the designers and there was minimal damage38 the project was completed on budget and a month ahead of schedule37 in 2015 the stadium was expanded with the addition of the toyota fan deck including a new 12 flag raising platform this expansion was privately funded by the seahawks and the 1000 additional seats were made available to purchase by current season ticket holders the blue pride waiting list for season tickets the additional seating pushed the capacity of the stadium to 69000plus39 surfaceedit the stadium prior to a sounders match on fieldturf in 2002 centurylink field became the first stadium in the nfl to install a fieldturf artificial field22 the surface is made of plastic fibers rooted in a mixture of ground rubber and sand40 the field was replaced in the spring of 2008 after tests showed that compression of the sand and rubber increased the risk of player injuries fieldturf won the bid for the second installation over polytan for the replacement surface a oneinch two and onehalf centimeters poured rubber foundation was added to prevent the compression from reoccurring under the naming rights agreement qwest paid 500000 for the installation and first goal paid the remaining amount which was undisclosed41 by 2010 the fieldturfs quality had decreased with the blades becoming matted down it also failed fifas quality testing to be ranked 2 star a new fieldturf surface was laid down in 2012 and it met the requirements of a 2 star field after testing42 the 1997 state referendum stated that the stadium would feature a natural grass surface but fieldturf was not an option when the stadium was originally presented to voters according to the public stadium authority43 seahawks management reconsidered surface after the seahawks played on fieldturf at husky stadium during the 2000 and 2001 seasons artificial turf was installed because it was easier to maintain than natural grass the potential damage to a natural grass field caused by seattles frequent rain also made the surface an appealing option31 in order to keep a grass surface robust under heavy football use during late fall and early winter rains a 18 million irrigation and heating system would have been required40 the coach of the seahawks at the time mike holmgren said fieldturf installation was the right decision and stated that the players love it and i think this surface will offer a better product on the field for the fans44 local soccer fans were concerned that the lack of a natural grass field would hinder seattles chances of receiving an mls expansion franchise40 they asserted that voters had approved the facility with the understanding that the new stadium was intended for soccer as well as football44 in a compromise first goal agreed to pay for grass to be installed for special events when needed41 there have been various opinions regarding both the artificial surface and temporary grass surfaces used for soccer matches after the brazilian national team defeated canadas side 3–2 in 2008 brazils coach commented that one reason for his teams unexpectedly poor performance was the loosely installed grass field45 the grenada national team struggled to cope with the artificial surface during their loss at the 2009 concacaf gold cup46 in july 2009 the us soccer federation chose dc uniteds rfk stadium over centurylink field for the us open cup the general manager of dc united speculated that rfks grass field was one of the reasons his team had a stronger bid47 the general manager of the sounders adrian hanauer told the seattle times in 2010 that replacement of the surface was a continuing conversation between the sounders and allens vulcan inc48 when the los angeles galaxy traveled to seattle in may 2012 the fieldturf was noted as one of the reasons david beckham and robbie keane were left out of the lineup49 between august and november both the seahawks and sounders fc host games at centurylink field each team has emphasized the importance of playing their games without the other teams painted lines on the field50 around 2003 at the seahawks request local company ecochemical developed for the field a new kind of paint designed to fail the new paint is relatively easy to remove with a power washer and a special chemical solution a process that the company describes as environmentally friendly with the new paint converting the field between american football and soccer takes 14 hours in dry weather though painting logos and other colors takes additional time51 a new turf field using the fieldturf revolution 360 was installed in february 2016 ahead of the 2016 sounders season52 footballedit seahawksedit see also seattle seahawks a 2006 seahawks game seen from the 300 level prior to the stadium opening in 2002 allen and bob whitsitt said that they hoped the new stadium would help turn the seahawks into a super bowl contender and that seattle would be considered to host the championship game22 the seating is expandable to 72000 for the purpose of holding the game but the nfl typically does not consider cities with outdoor stadiums where the average temperature in february is below 50 °f 10 °c53 the number of season tickets available at qwest was capped at 61000 following the super bowl appearance the ensuing waiting list was the first for the seahawks since the early 1990s54 the teams first season at their new home was in 2002 their first game at the new facility was a 28–10 preseason loss to the indianapolis colts on august 11 200255 they went on to end their first season at the new field with a 7–9 record in the 2003 season the team went undefeated at home and reached the playoffs it was the first time the franchise had won 10 games in a single season in 17 years56 the seahawks again reached the postseason during the 2004 season and played their first playoff game at centurylink field on january 8 2005 in that game they lost to the st louis rams who had already defeated them twice that season57 the following season the seahawks went undefeated at home for the second time in three years and won their firstever nfc championship58 but lost

advantageedit centurylink field has earned a reputation as one of the loudest stadiums in the nfl it was at one point in time in the guinness world record books for being the loudest stadium in the world97475 the seating decks and partial roof both trap and amplify exceptional amounts of noise and reflect it back onto the field76 this noise possibly contributes to increased false start penalties since opposing offenses can miss audibles and the snap count as well as delay of game penalties due to the reduced efficiency of communicating plays to the offense5977 from 2002 through 2012 there have been 143 falsestart penalties on visiting teams in seattle second only to the minnesota vikings78 during that same time period the seahawks have accumulated a home win record of 5929 with a

public address system during this game86 the nfl sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season about such complaints and sent officials to monitor two games76 holmgren denied the allegations and the crowd responded by being even louder than usual when the giants returned to centurylink field8687 since 2005 the seahawks have tracked the number of false starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate the crowd as of 2013 the stadium has had a leaguehigh number of false starts since888990 in preparation for 2005–06 nfc championship game at
