community radio is a radio service offering a third model of radio broadcasting in addition to commercial and public broadcasting community stations serve geographic communities and communities of interest they broadcast content that is popular and relevant to a local specific audience but is often overlooked by commercial or massmedia broadcasters community radio stations are operated owned and influenced by the communities they serve they are generally nonprofit and provide a mechanism for enabling individuals groups and communities to tell their own stories to share experiences and in a mediarich world to become creators and contributors of media in many parts of the world community radio acts as a vehicle for the community and voluntary sector civil society agencies ngos and citizens to work in partnership to further community development aims in addition to broadcasting there is legally defined community radio as a distinct broadcasting sector in many countries such as france argentina south africa australia and ireland much of the legislation has included phrases such as social benefit social objectives and social gain as part of the definition community radio has

their listeners by offering a variety of content that is not necessarily provided by the larger commercial radio stations community radio outlets may carry news and information programming geared toward the local area particularly immigrant or minority groups who are poorly served by major media outlets specialized musical shows are also often a feature of many community radio stations community and pirate stations in areas where they are tolerated can be valuable assets for a region community radio stations typically avoid content found on commercial outlets such as top 40 music sports and drivetime personalities a meme used by members of the movement is that community radio should be 10 percent radio and 90 percent community this means that community radio stations should focus on getting the community talking and not solely on radio which is a technological process the social concerns of community radio are stressed over radio per se there is also a distinction drawn in contrast to mainstream stations which are viewed as pandering to commercial concerns or the personalities of presenters conceptions of community in the literatureedit communities are complex entities and what constitutes the community in community radio is subject to debate which varies by country community may be replaced by terms such as alternative radical or citizen radio in sociology a community has been defined as a group of interacting people living in a common locationcitation needed community radio has been built around the ideals of access and participation stations have been run by locals typically to serve a local audience however the internets availability and popularity has encouraged many stations to podcast andor stream and audio and make it available globallycitation needed modelsedit two philosophical approaches to community radio exist although the models are not mutually exclusive one emphasizes service and communitymindedness focusing on what the station can do for the community the other stresses involvement and participation by the listenercitation needed in the service model locality is valued community radio as a third tier can provide content focused on a more local or particular community than a larger operation sometimes though providing syndicated content not already available within the stations service area is viewed as public service within the united states for example many stations syndicate content from groups such as pacifica radio such as democracy now on the basis that it provides content not otherwise available because of a programs lack of appeal to advertisers—in pacificas case due to its politically controversial nature in the access or participatory model the participation of community members in producing content is viewed as a good in itself while this model does not necessarily exclude a service approach there is some disagreement between the twocitation needed by countryedit australiaedit community broadcasting is australia’s third media sector formally represented by the community broadcasting association of australia cbaa in january 2012 there were 359 licensed community radio stations including remote indigenous services1 a 2002 report found that 20000 australians or 01 percent of the population were involved as volunteers in the community radio sector on a regular basis

community broadcasting in australia according to cbaa is to provide a diverse range of services meeting community needs in ways unmet by other sectors community broadcasting is sustained by the principles of access and participation volunteerism diversity independence and locality4 community radio stations may be specialized music stations represent local music and arts or broadcast talks and currentaffairs programs representing alternative indigenous australian environmental feminist or gay and lesbian interests filling perceived gaps in commercial or government radio content 53 percent of community radio stations serve an array of communities of interest including indigenous and ethnic groups people with a print disability young people older people the artsfine music religious and the gay and lesbian communities the remaining stations provide a service which may be described as generalist addressing the interests of communities in particular areas but also addressing a range of specialized interests4 community broadcasting more than any other form of media in australia shapes and reflects the national character in all its diversity the sector is unique in its capacity to provide fresh programming by and for indigenous ethnic and rph communities community broadcasting stations have a strong commitment to local news and information the promotion of local and national music arts and culture and providing training in media skills5 when a notforprofit community group applies to the regulating body the australian communications and media authority

application and the capacity to serve identified community interests upon grant of a fiveyear renewable licence each station is required to continue to serve the community interest for which the licence was granted the broadcast services act establishes the requirement to continue to represent the licensed community of interest and the requirement to encourage participation from the licensed community of interest in the provision and selection of programs as key conditions of the licence provisions for temporary community radio liceneces in the act allow where spectrum is available for aspirant community groups to develop their facilities and financial and programming models before the regulator considers making a permanent licence available6 austriaedit main article alliance of

sports to music and quiz shows although there is a need for such stations it is difficult for them to succeed due to financial and structural problems and a lack of funding9 boliviaedit a wellknown example of community radio in bolivia was the tin miners radio funded by trade union dues and operated mainly at the local and regional level there were more than 25 such radio stations between 1960 and 1985 changes in government policy eliminated many unionised mining jobs after 1985 and some radio stations were sold or ceased to exist in spite of many difficulties five stations continue to broadcastcitation needed la voz del minero radio pío xii radiovanguardia de colquiri radio animas radio 21 de diciembre and radio nacional de huanuni were some of the most important radio stations created funded and managed by bolivian mining workers10 in 1949 a station began broadcasting in the mining district of catavi during the next 15 years other districts followed they bought the equipment trained young people from their villages and the workers funded the stations with a percentage of their salaries most of the radio stations began small with simple equipment a few received foreign support and evolved into more sophisticated stations with better equipment several built theatres next to their stations so union meetings could be broadcast live for example radio vanguardia had a theatre decorated with large murals narrating the story of the colquiri mining centre one scene on a mural depicts the attack by bolivian air force planes in 1967 when the country was under military rule during the early 1970s 26 radio stations were in operation all in the mining districts of the highlands at the time the miners unions in bolivia were still powerful and considered among the most politically advanced in latin america in times of peace and democracy the miners radio stations were integrated into the daily life of the community becoming an effective replacement for telephone and postal service people would receive their mail through the stations and post messages which were read several times during the day calls for a meeting of women from the comité de amas de casa housewives committee messages from union leaders about their negotiations with the government in the capital messages of love between young people the announcement of a new play by the nuevos horizontes theater group often staged on the platform of a big truck with workers illuminating the scene with their own lamps and announcements of sport activities burials births and festivities in times of political upheaval the union radio stations would become the only trustworthy source of information as the military captured newspapers radio and tv stations in the capital and other cities the only information available would come from the miners radio stations they would join the cadena minera mining chain until the army penetrated the mining camps and mounted an assault on the stations which were defended sometimes to the death by the workers a film by bolivian filmmaker jorge sanjinés the courage of the people reenacts the attack on the mining district of siglo xx by the army in june 1967 another film a documentary by alfonso gumucio dagron and eduardo barrios entitled voices of the mine and produced by unesco describes their political and social importance the miners radio stations would air reports on the political situation they would also link for live transmissions when an important sporting or cultural event took place in the mining district other than that each station was fully independent of the others the miners radio stations were important because of the importance of mining in bolivia bolivian miners were also influential because for several decades they had a powerful means to communicate their ideas as the importance of mining in bolivia declined during the 1980s the unions were weakened and some of the radio stations disappeared along with their mining districts canadaedit see also list of community radio stations in canada community radio stations in canada often target commercially underserved minoritylanguage communities such as

letters and frequencies are regulated by industry canada’s spectrum management14 the crtc classifies community radio stations as one of two types with slightly different regulatory requirements most stations are classified as type b however a community radio station which operates as the sole local media service serving its community — such as an english language community radio station in quebec a first nations radio station or a community radio station in a small town with no other local radio stations at all — is classified as type a granting it a more flexible set of regulatory and license
