acquired by google in 2014 the company has created a neural network that learns how to play video games in a fashion similar to that of humans4 as well as a neural turing machine5 or a neural network that may be able to access an external memory like a conventional turing machine resulting in a computer that mimics the shortterm memory of the human brain67 the company made headlines in 2016 in nature after its alphago program beat a human professional go player for the first time in october 20158 and again when alphago beat lee sedol the world champion in a five game tournament which was the subject of a documentary film contents 1 history 2 machine learning 21 deep reinforcement learning 22 alphago 221 technology 3 healthcare 31 controversies 4 see also 5 references 6 external links historyedit the startup was founded by demis hassabis shane legg and mustafa suleyman in 2010910 hassabis and legg first met at university college londons gatsby computational neuroscience unit11 on 26 january 2014 google announced the company had acquired deepmind for 500 million121314151617 and that it had agreed to take over deepmind technologies since then major venture capital firms horizons ventures and founders fund have invested in the company18 as well as entrepreneurs scott banister19 and elon musk20 jaan tallinn was an early investor and an adviser to the company21 the sale to google took place after facebook reportedly ended negotiations with deepmind technologies in 201322 the company was afterwards renamed google deepmind and kept that name for about two years2 in 2014 deepmind received the company of the year award by cambridge computer laboratory23 in september 2015 deepmind and the royal free nhs trust signed their initial information sharing agreementisa to codevelop a clinical task management app streams24 after googles acquisition the company established an artificial intelligence ethics board25 the ethics board for ai research remains a mystery with both google and deepmind declining to reveal who sits on the board26 deepmind together with amazon google facebook ibm and microsoft is a founding member of partnership on ai an organization devoted to the societyai interface27 deepmind has opened a new unit called deepmind ethics and society and focused on the ethical and societal questions raised by artificial intelligence featuring prominent transhumanist nick bostrom as advisor28 in october 2017 deepmind launched new ethics and society research team to investigate ai ethics2930 machine learningedit deepmind technologies goal is to solve intelligence31 which they are trying to achieve by combining the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful generalpurpose learning algorithms31 they are trying to formalize intelligence32 in order to not only implement it into machines but also understand the human brain as demis hassabis explains attempting to distil intelligence into an algorithmic construct may prove to be the best path to understanding some of the enduring mysteries of our minds33 google research has released a paper in 2016 regarding ai safety and avoiding undesirable behaviour during the ai learning process34 deepmind has also released several publications via their website35 to date the company has published research on computer systems that are able to play games and developing these systems ranging from strategy games such as go36 to arcade games according to shane legg humanlevel machine intelligence can be achieved when a machine can learn to play a really wide range of games from perceptual stream input and output and transfer understanding across games37 research describing an ai playing seven different atari 2600 video games the pong game in video olympics breakout space invaders seaquest beamrider enduro and qbert reportedly led to their acquisition by google4 hassabis has mentioned the popular esport game starcraft as a possible future challenge since it requires a high level of strategic thinking and handling imperfect information38 deep reinforcement learningedit as opposed to other ais such as ibms deep blue or watson which were developed for a predefined purpose and only function within its scope deepmind claims that their system is not preprogrammed it learns from experience using only raw pixels as data input technically it uses deep learning on a convolutional neural network with a novel form of qlearning a form of modelfree reinforcement learning239 they test the system on video games notably early arcade games such as space invaders or breakout3940 without altering the code the ai begins to understand how to play the game and after some time plays for a few games most notably breakout a more efficient game than any human ever could40 for most games space invaders ms pacman qbert for example deepmind plays below the currentwhen world record the application of deepminds ai to video games is currentlywhen for games made in the 1970s and 1980s with work being done on more complex 3d games such as doom which first appeared in the early 1990s40 alphagoedit main article alphago in october 2015 a computer go program called alphago powered by deepmind beat the european go champion fan hui a 2 dan out of 9 dan possible professional five to zero41 this is the first time an artificial intelligence ai defeated a professional go player8 previously computers were only known to have played go at amateur level4142 go is considered much more difficult for computers to win compared to other games like chess due to the much larger number of possibilities making it prohibitively difficult for traditional ai methods such as bruteforce4142 in march 2016 it beat lee sedol—a 9th dan go player and one of the highest ranked players in the world—with 41 in a fivegame match in the 2017 future of go summit alphago won a threegame match with ke jie who at the time continuously held the world no 1 ranking for two years 4344 it used a supervised learning protocol studying large numbers of games played by humans against each other45 in 2017 an improved version alphago zero defeated alphago 100 games to 0 zero discovered on its own many of the moves of human go players and added new ones technologyedit alphago used two deep neural networks a policy network to evaluate move probabilities and a value network to assess positions the policy network trained via supervised learning and was subsequently refined by policygradient reinforcement learning the value network learned to predict winners of games played by the policy network against itself after training these networks employed a lookahead monte carlo tree search mcts using the policy network to identify candidate highprobability moves while the value network in conjunction with monte carlo rollouts using a fast rollout policy evaluated tree positions46 zero trained using reinforcement learning in which the system played millions of games against itself its only guide was to increase its win rate it did so without learning from games played by humans its only input features are the black and white stones from the board it uses a single neural network rather than separate policy and value networks its simplified tree search relies upon this neural network to evaluate positions and sample moves without monte carlo rollouts a new reinforcement learning algorithm incorporates lookahead search inside the training loop46 alphago zero employed around 15 people and millions in computing resources47 ultimately it needed much less computing power than alphago running on four specialized ai processors google tpus instead of alphagos 4848 healthcareedit in july 2016 a collaboration between deepmind and moorfields eye hospital was announced49 deepmind would be applied to the analysis of anonymised eye scans searching for early signs of diseases leading to blindness in august 2016 a research programme with university college london hospital was announced with the aim of developing an algorithm that can automatically differentiate between healthy and cancerous tissues in head and neck areas50 there are also projects with the royal free london nhs foundation trust and imperial college healthcare nhs trust to develop new clinical mobile apps linked to electronic patient records51 controversiesedit in april 2016 new scientist obtained a copy of a datasharing agreement between deepmind and the royal free london nhs foundation trust the latter operates the three london hospitals where an estimated 16 million patients are treated annually the revelation has exposed the ease with which private companies can obtain highly sensitive medical information without patient consent the agreement shows deepmind health had access to admissions discharge and transfer data accident and emergency pathology and radiology and critical care at these hospitals this included personal details such as whether patients had been diagnosed with hiv suffered from depression or had ever undergone an abortion in order to conduct research to seek better outcomes in various health conditions5253 the agreement is seen as controversial and its legality has been questioned26 the concerns were widely reported and have led to a complaint to the information commissioners office ico arguing that the data should be pseudonymised and encrypted54 in may 2016 new scientist published a further article claiming that the project had failed to secure approval from the confidentiality advisory group of the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency55 in may 2017 sky news published a leaked letter from the national data guardian dame fiona caldicott revealing that in her considered opinion the data sharing agreement between deepmind and the royal free took place on an inappropriate legal basis56 the information commissioner’s office ruled that london’s royal free hospital failed to comply with the data protection act when it handed over personal data of 16 million patients to deepmind 57 see alsoedit artificial intelligence glossary of artificial intelligence referencesedit deepmind technologies
