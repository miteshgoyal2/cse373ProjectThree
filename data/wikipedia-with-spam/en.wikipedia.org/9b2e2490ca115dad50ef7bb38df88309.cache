attack flashing vision faintness or nausea numbness throughout the body heavy breathing and hyperventilation or loss of body control some people also suffer from tunnel vision mostly due to blood flow leaving the head to more critical parts of the body in defense these feelings may provoke a strong urge to escape or flee the place where the attack began a consequence of the fightorflight response in which the hormone causing this response is released in significant amounts this response floods the body with hormones particularly epinephrine adrenaline which aid it in defending against harm8 a panic attack is a response of the sympathetic nervous system sns the most common symptoms include trembling dyspnea shortness of breath heart palpitations chest pain or chest tightness hot flashes cold flashes burning sensations particularly in the facial or neck area sweating nausea dizziness or slight vertigo lightheadedness hyperventilation paresthesias tingling sensations sensations of choking or smothering difficulty moving and derealization these physical symptoms are interpreted with alarm in people prone to panic attacks this results in increased anxiety and forms a positive feedback loop9 often the onset of shortness of breath and chest pain are the predominant symptoms people with a panic attack may incorrectly attribute them to a heart attack and thus trigger seeking treatment in an emergency room however since chest pain and shortness of breath are indeed hallmark symptoms of cardiovascular illnesses including unstable angina and myocardial infarction heart attack especially in a person whose mental health status and heart health status are not known attributing these pains to simple anxiety and not also a physical condition is a diagnosis of exclusion other conditions must be ruled out first until an electrocardiogram and a mental health assessment have been carried out panic attacks are distinguished from other forms of anxiety by their intensity and their sudden episodic nature8 they are often experienced in conjunction with anxiety disorders and other psychological conditions although panic attacks are not generally indicative of a mental disorder causesedit longterm predisposing causes – the onset of panic disorder usually occurs in early adulthood although it may appear at any age it occurs more frequently in women and more often in people with aboveaverage intelligence various twin studies where one identical twin has an anxiety disorder have reported a 31–88 incidence of the other twin also having an anxiety disorder diagnosis environmental factors such as an overcautious view of the world expressed by parents and cumulative stress over time have been found to be correlated with panic attacks8 biological causes – obsessive compulsive disorder postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome post traumatic stress disorder hypoglycemia hyperthyroidism wilsons disease mitral valve prolapse pheochromocytoma and inner ear disturbances labyrinthitis dysregulation of the norepinephrine system in the locus ceruleus an area of the brain stem has been linked to panic attacks10 marijuana – according to the harvard mental health letter the most commonly reported side effects of smoking marijuana are anxiety and panic attacks studies report that about 20 to 30 of recreational users experience such problems after smoking marijuana11 phobias – people will often experience panic attacks as a direct result of exposure to a phobic object or situation shortterm triggering causes – significant personal loss including an emotional attachment to a romantic partner life transitions significant life change maintaining causes – avoidance of panicprovoking situations or environments anxiousnegative selftalk whatif thinking mistaken beliefs these symptoms are harmful andor dangerous withheld feelings hyperventilation syndrome – breathing from the chest may cause overbreathing exhaling excessive carbon dioxide in relation to the amount of oxygen in ones bloodstream hyperventilation syndrome can cause respiratory alkalosis and hypocapnia this syndrome often involves prominent mouth breathing as well this causes a cluster of symptoms including rapid heart beat dizziness and lightheadedness which can trigger panic attacks situationally bound panic attacks – associating certain situations with panic attacks due to experiencing one in that particular situation can create a cognitive or behavioral predisposition to having panic attacks in certain situations situationally bound panic attacks discontinuation or marked reduction in the dose of a substance such as a drug drug withdrawal for example an antidepressant antidepressant discontinuation syndrome can cause a panic attack panic disorderedit main article panic disorder people who have repeated persistent attacks or feel severe anxiety about having another attack are said to have panic disorder panic disorder is strikingly different from other types of anxiety disorders in that panic attacks are often sudden and unprovoked12 however panic attacks experienced by those with panic disorder may also be linked to or heightened by certain places or situations making daily life difficult13 agoraphobiaedit main article agoraphobia agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder which primarily consists of the fear of experiencing a difficult or embarrassing situation from which the sufferer cannot escape panic attacks are commonly linked to agoraphobia and the fear of not being able to escape a bad situation14 as the result severe sufferers of agoraphobia may become confined to their homes experiencing difficulty traveling from this safe place15 the word agoraphobia is an english adoption of the greek words agora αγορά and phobos φόβος the term agora refers to the place where ancient greeks used to gather and talk about issues of the city so it basically applies to any or all public places however the essence of agoraphobia is a fear of panic attacks especially if they occur in public as the victim may feel like he or she has no escape in the case of agoraphobia caused by social phobia or social anxiety sufferers may be very embarrassed by having a panic attack publicly in the first place this translation is the reason for the common misconception that agoraphobia is a fear of open spaces and is not clinically accurate agoraphobia as described in this manner is actually a symptom professionals check for when making a diagnosis of panic disorder other syndromes like obsessive compulsive disorder or post traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder can also cause agoraphobia basically any irrational fear that keeps one from going outside can cause the syndrome16 people who have had a panic attack in certain situations may develop irrational fears called phobias of these situations and begin to avoid them eventually the pattern of avoidance and level of anxiety about another attack may reach the point where individuals with panic disorder are unable to drive or even step out of the house at this stage the person is said to have panic disorder with agoraphobia this can be one of the most harmful sideeffects of panic disorder as it can prevent sufferers from seeking treatment in the first placecitation needed experimentally inducededit panic attack symptoms can be experimentally induced in the laboratory by various means among them for research purposes by administering a bolus injection of the neuropeptide cholecystokinintetrapeptide cck417 various animal models of panic attacks have been experimentally studied18 pathophysiologyedit the symptoms of a panic attack may cause the person to feel that their body is failing the symptoms can be understood as follows first there is frequently the sudden onset of fear with little provoking stimulus this leads to a release of adrenaline epinephrine which brings about the fightorflight response when the body prepares for strenuous physical activity this leads to an increased heart rate tachycardia rapid breathing hyperventilation which may be perceived as shortness of breath dyspnea and sweating because strenuous activity rarely ensues the hyperventilation leads to a drop in carbon dioxide levels in the lungs and then in the blood this leads to shifts in blood ph respiratory alkalosis or hypocapnia causing compensatory metabolic acidosis activating chemosensing mechanisms which translate this ph shift into autonomic and respiratory responses1920 the person himherself may overlook the hyperventilation having become preoccupied with the associated somatic symptoms21 moreover this hypocapnia and release of adrenaline during a panic attack cause vasoconstriction resulting in slightly less blood flow to the head which causes dizziness and lightheadedness2223 a panic attack can cause blood sugar to be drawn away from the brain and toward the major muscles neuroimaging suggests heightened activity in the amygdala thalamus hypothalamus and brainstem regions including the periaqueductal gray parabrachial nucleus and locus coeruleus24 in particular the amygdala has been suggested to have a critical role25 the combination of high arousal in the amygdala and brainstem along with decreased blood flow and blood sugar in the brain can lead to dramatically decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex region of the brain 26 diagnosisedit dsm5 diagnostic criteria for a panic attack include a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four or more of the following symptoms developed abruptly and reached a peak within minutes palpitations andor accelerated heart rate sweating trembling or shaking sensations of shortness of breath or being smothered feeling of choking chest pain or discomfort nausea or abdominal distress feeling dizzy unsteady lightheaded or faint derealization feelings of unreality or depersonalization being detached from oneself fear of losing control or going insane sense of impending death paresthesias numbness or tingling sensations chills or hot flashes in dsm5 culturespecific symptoms eg tinnitus neck soreness headache and uncontrollable screaming or crying may be seen such symptoms should not count as one of the four required symptoms some or all of these symptoms can be found in the presence of a pheochromocytoma screening tools such as the panic disorder severity scale can be used to detect possible cases of disorder and suggest the need for a formal diagnostic assessment2728 treatmentedit panic disorder can be effectively treated with a variety of interventions including psychological therapies and medication8 with the strongest and most consistent evidence indicating that cognitive behavioral therapy has the most complete and longest duration of effect followed by specific selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors29 subsequent research by barbara milrod and her colleagues30 suggests that psychoanalytic psychotherapy might be effective in relieving panic attacks however those results alone should be addressed with care while the results obtained in joint treatments that include cognitive behavioral therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are corroborated by many studies and metaanalysis those obtained by barbara milrod are not scientific reliability of psychoanalytic psychotherapy for treating panic disorder has not yet been addressed specifically the mechanisms by which psychoanalysis reduces panic are not understood whereas cognitivebehavioral therapy has a clear conceptual basis that can be applied to panic the term anxiolytic has become nearly synonymous with the benzodiazepines because these compounds have been for almost 40 years the drugs of choice for stressrelated anxiety breathing exercisesedit in the great majority of cases hyperventilation is involved exacerbating the effects of the panic attack breathing retraining exercise helps to rebalance the oxygen and co2 levels in the blood31 david d burns recommends breathing exercises for those suffering from anxiety one such breathing exercise is a 525 count using the stomach or diaphragm—and not the chest—inhale feel the stomach come out as opposed to the chest expanding for 5 seconds as the maximal point at inhalation is reached hold the breath for 2 seconds then slowly exhale over 5 seconds repeat this cycle twice and then breathe normally for 5 cycles 1 cycle 1 inhale 1 exhale the point is to focus on the breathing and relax the heart rate regular diaphragmatic breathing may be achieved by extending the outbreath by counting or humming although breathing into a paper bag was a common recommendation for shortterm treatment of symptoms of an acute panic attack32 it has been criticized as inferior to measured breathing potentially worsening the panic attack and possibly reducing needed blood oxygen3334 while the paper bag technique increases needed carbon dioxide and so reduces symptoms it may excessively lower oxygen levels in the blood stream capnometry which provides exhaled co2 levels may help guide breathing3536 therapyedit according to the american psychological association most specialists agree that a combination of cognitive and behavioral therapies are the best treatment for panic disorder medication might also be appropriate in some cases37 the first part of therapy is largely informational many people are greatly helped by simply understanding exactly what panic disorder is and how many others suffer from it many people who suffer from panic disorder are worried that their panic attacks mean they are going crazy or that the panic might induce a heart attack cognitive restructuring helps people replace those thoughts with more realistic positive ways of viewing the attacks38 exposure therapy39 which includes repeated and prolonged confrontation with feared situations and body sensations helps weaken anxiety responses to these external and internal stimuli and reinforce realistic ways of viewing panic symptoms in deeper level psychoanalytic approaches in particular object relations theory panic attacks are frequently associated with splitting psychology paranoidschizoid and depressive positions and paranoid anxiety they are often found comorbid with borderline personality disorder and child sexual abuse paranoid anxiety may reach the level of a persecutory anxiety state40 meditation may also be helpful in the treatment of panic disorders41 dietary changesedit caffeine may cause or exacerbate panic anxiety anxiety can temporarily increase during withdrawal from caffeine and various other drugs42 exerciseedit increased and regimented aerobic exercise such as running have been shown to have a positive effect in combating panic anxiety there is evidence that suggests that this effect is correlated to the release of exerciseinduced endorphins and the subsequent reduction of the stress hormone cortisol43 there remains a chance of panic symptoms becoming triggered or exacerbated due to increased respiration rate that occurs during aerobic exercise this increased respiration rate can lead to hyperventilation and hyperventilation syndrome which mimics symptoms of a heart attack thus inducing a panic attack44 benefits of incorporating an exercise regimen have shown best results when paced accordingly45 prognosisedit many people being treated for panic attacks begin to experience limited symptom attacks these panic attacks are less comprehensive with fewer than four bodily symptoms being experienced8 it is not unusual to experience only one or two symptoms at a time such as vibrations in their legs shortness of breath or an intense wave of heat traveling up their bodies which is not similar to hot flashes due to estrogen shortage some symptoms such as vibrations in the legs are sufficiently different from any normal sensation that they clearly indicate panic disorder other symptoms on the list can occur in people who may or may not have panic disorder panic disorder does not require four or more symptoms to all be present at the same time causeless panic and racing heartbeat are sufficient to indicate a panic attack8 epidemiologyedit in europe about 3 of the population has a panic attack in a given year while in the united states they affect about 11 they are more common in females than males they often begin during puberty or early adulthood children and older people are less commonly affected2 see alsoedit nervous breakdown referencesedit a b anxiety
