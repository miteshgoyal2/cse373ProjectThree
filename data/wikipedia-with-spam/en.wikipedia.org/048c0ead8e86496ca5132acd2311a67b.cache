libertarian tom bailey in a hotly contested race the final month of the senate campaign saw both bowless and burrs campaigns turn strongly negative with burrs campaign attacking bowless associations with the clinton administration while bowless campaign attacked burr on his support of trade legislation and special interest donations both campaigns spent a great deal of money making it one of the

of the state party ticket bowles was defeated in the 2004 race as well president bushs comfortable electoral victory in north carolina likely helped burr considerably during his concession speech in

report on a policy for budget deficit reduction was not adopted by the obama administration10 surprised by the rejection bowles later stated he believed that obama decided to abandon the report and let incoming house budget chairman paul ryan go first and then he would look like the sensible guy in the game based on advice from his political advisers and over the objections of his economic team10 on september 7 2011 facebook inc announced that it had named bowles to its board11 after north carolina governor bev perdue announced that she would not run for a second term in 2012 bowles was

14 2012 bowles gave an interview with the daily caller where he asserted that he is not backing away from his praise of republican vice presidential candidate paul ryan said bowles “i think hes smart i think hes intellectually curious i think he is honest straightforward and sincere and i think he does have a serious budget out there — it doesn’t mean i agree with it by any stretch of the imagination but im not going to act like i dont like him or that i dont have some real respect for him along with his praise of ryan he also had criticism of the current government said bowles “the people of this country get it they know that the fiscal path this country is on is not sustainable and that these deficits of over a trillion dollars a year are a cancer that in time will destroy our country from within despite his praise of ryan bowles says he plans on voting for president obama in november “who i vote for is my business but i am certainly a registered democrat and i’m proud to be so” bowles said in the phone interview “and i certainly envision voting for the president for sure” 13 electoral historyedit 2004 election for us senate richard burr r 52 erskine bowles d 47 2002
