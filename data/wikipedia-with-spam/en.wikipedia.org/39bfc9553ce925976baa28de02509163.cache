northwestern united states the pacific northwest from outer space play media this visualization shows a sequence of landsatbased data in the pacific northwest the pacific northwest pnw sometimes referred to as cascadia is a geographic region in western north america bounded by the pacific ocean to the west and loosely by the cascade mountain range on the east though no agreed boundary exists a common conception includes the us states of oregon and washington and the canadian province of british columbia broader conceptions reach north into southeast alaska and yukon south into northern california and east to the continental divide thus including idaho western montana and western wyoming narrower conceptions may be limited to the northwestern us or to the coastal areas west of the cascade and coast mountains the variety of definitions can be attributed to partially overlapping commonalities of the regions history culture geography society and other factors the northwest coast is the coastal region of the pacific northwest and the northwest plateau also commonly known as the interior in british columbia1 and the inland empire in the united states is the inland region the term pacific northwest should not be confused with the northwest territory also known as the great northwest a historical term in the united states or the northwest territories of canada the regions largest metropolitan areas are greater seattle washington with 37 million people2 greater portland oregon with 24 million people3 and greater vancouver british columbia with 24 million people4 a key aspect of the pacific northwest is the us–canada international border which the united states and the united kingdom established at a time when the regions inhabitants were composed mostly of indigenous peoples the border — in two sections along the 49th parallel south of british columbia and the alaska panhandle west of northern british columbia — has had a powerful effect on the region according to canadian historian ken coates the border has not merely influenced the pacific northwest—rather the regions history and character have been determined by the boundary5 contents 1

washington oregon idaho and british columbia definitions of the pacific northwest region vary and even pacific northwesterners do not agree on the exact boundary78 a common conception of the pacific northwest includes the us states of oregon and washington as well as the canadian province of british columbia5 broader definitions of the region have included the us state of alaska598 the canadian territory of the yukon5 the northwestern portion of the state of california6 and even areas reaching east to the rocky mountains5 definitions based on the historic oregon country reach east to the continental divide thus including nearly all of idaho and parts of western montana and western wyoming sometimes the pacific northwest is defined as being the northwestern united states specifically excluding canada note that these types of definitions are often made by government agencies whose scope is limited to the united states10 in addition to the conventional grouping of washington oregon idaho and british columbia some definitions also include southeast alaska western montana the coast of northern california and a small part of northwestern wyoming11 historyedit indigenous peoplesedit see also indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast and indigenous peoples of the northwest plateau the pacific northwest has been occupied by a diverse array of indigenous peoples for millennia the pacific coast is seen by some scholars as a major coastal migration route in the settlement of the americas by late pleistocene peoples moving from northeast asia into the americas12 the coastal migration hypothesis has been bolstered by findings such as the report that the sediments in the port eliza caves on vancouver island indicate the possibility of survivable climate as far back as 16 ka 16000 years in the area while the continental ice sheets were nearing their maximum extent13 other evidence for human occupation dating back as much as 14500 years ago is emerging from paisley caves in southcentral oregon1415 however despite such research the coastal migration hypothesis is still subject to considerable debate1617 due in part to the richness of pacific northwest coast and river fisheries some of the indigenous peoples developed complex sedentary societies while remaining huntergatherers18 the pacific northwest coast is one of the few places where politically complex huntergatherers evolved and survived to historic contacts and therefore has been vital for anthropologists and archaeologists seeking to understand how complex hunter and gatherer societies function19 when europeans first arrived on the northwest coast they found one of the worlds most complex hunting and fishing societies with large sedentary villages large houses systems of social rank and prestige extensive trade networks and many other factors more commonly associated with societies based on domesticated agriculture1920 in the interior of the pacific northwest the indigenous peoples at the time of european contact had a diversity of cultures and societies some areas were home to mobile and egalitarian societies others especially along major rivers such as the columbia and fraser had very complex affluent sedentary societies rivaling those of the coast21 in british columbia and southeast alaska the tlingit and haida erected large and elaborately carved totem poles that have become iconic of pacific northwest artistic traditions throughout the pacific northwest thousands of indigenous people live and some continue to practice their rich cultural traditions organizing their societies around cedar and salmon22 initial european explorationedit main article history of the west coast of north america in 1579 the british captain and erstwhile privateer francis drake sailed up the west coast of north america perhaps as far as oregon before returning south to land and make ship repairs at this landing site probably near presentday san francisco drake made a symbolic claim of the region for england naming it new albion911–1223 juan de fuca a greek captain sailing for the crown of spain supposedly found the strait of juan de fuca around 1592 the strait was named for him but whether he discovered it or not has long been questioned24 during the early 1740s imperial russia sent the dane vitus bering to the region25 by the late 18th century and into the mid19th century russian settlers had established several posts and communities on the northeast pacific coast eventually reaching as far south as fort ross california the russian river was named after these settlements in 1774 the viceroy of new spain sent spanish navigator juan pérez in the ship santiago to the pacific northwest peréz made landfall on haida gwaii queen charlotte islands on july 18 1774 the northernmost latitude he reached was 54°40′ n26 this was followed in 1775 by another spanish expedition under the command of bruno de heceta and including juan peréz and juan francisco de la bodega y quadra as officers on july 14 1775 they landed on the olympic peninsula near the mouth of the quinault river on august 17 1775 heceta returning south sighted the mouth of the columbia river and named it bahia de la asunción while heceta sailed south quadra continued north in the expeditions second ship the sonora reaching alaska at 59° n27 in 1778 english mariner captain james cook visited nootka sound on vancouver island and also voyaged as far as prince william sound in 1779 a third spanish expedition under the command of ignacio de artega in the ship princesa and with quadra as captain of the ship favorite sailed from mexico to the coast of alaska reaching 61° n two further spanish expeditions in 1788 and 1789 both under esteban jose martínez and gonzalo lópez de haro sailed to the pacific northwest during the second expedition they met the american captain robert gray near nootka sound upon entering nootka sound they found william douglas and his ship the iphigenia conflict led to the nootka crisis which was resolved by agreements known as the nootka convention in 1790 the spanish sent three ships to nootka sound under the command of francisco de eliza after establishing a base at nootka eliza sent out several exploration parties salvador fidalgo was sent north to the alaska coast manuel quimper with gonzalo lópez de haro as pilot explored the strait of juan de fuca discovering the san juan islands and admiralty inlet in the process francisco de eliza himself took the ship san carlos into the strait of juan de fuca from a base at port discovery his pilotos masters josé maría narváez and juan carrasco explored the san juan islands haro strait rosario strait and bellingham bay in the process they discovered the strait of georgia and explored it as far north as texada island the expedition returned to nootka sound by august 1791 alessandro malaspina sailing for spain explored and mapped the coast from yakutat bay to prince william sound in 1791 then sailed to nootka sound performing a scientific expedition in the manner of james cook malaspinas scientists studied the tlingit and nuuchahnulth peoples before returning to mexico another spanish explorer jacinto caamaño sailed the ship aranzazu to nootka sound in may 1792 there he met quadra who was in command of the spanish settlement and fort san miguel quadra sent caamaño north to carefully explore the coast between vancouver island and bucareli bay alaska various spanish maps including caamaños were given to george vancouver in 1792 as the spanish and british worked together to chart the complex coastline27 from 1792 to 1794 george vancouver charted the pacific northwest on behalf of great britain including the strait of georgia the bays and inlets of puget sound and the johnstone strait–queen charlotte strait and much of the rest of the british columbia coast and southeast alaska shorelines26 for him the city of vancouver and vancouver island are named as well as vancouver washington from mexico malaspina dispatched the last spanish exploration expedition in the pacific northwest under dionisio alcalá galiano and cayentano valdes aboard the schooners sutil and mexicana28 they met vancouver in the strait of georgia on june 21 1792 vancouver had explored puget sound just previously the spanish explorers knew of admiralty inlet and the unexplored region to the south but they decided to sail north they discovered and entered the fraser river shortly before meeting vancouver after sharing maps and agreeing to cooperate galiano valdés and vancouver sailed north to desolation sound and the discovery islands charting the coastline together they passed through johnstone strait and cordero channel and returned to nootka sound as a result the spanish explorers who had set out from nootka became the first europeans to circumnavigate vancouver island vancouver himself had entered the strait of juan de fuca directly without going to nootka first so had not sailed completely around the island27 in 1786 jeanfrançois de la pérouse representing france sailed to haida gwaii after visiting nootka sound but any possible french claims to this region were lost when la pérouse and his men and journals were lost in a shipwreck near australia upon encountering the salish coastal tribes either pérouse or someone in his crew remarked what must astonish most is to see painting everywhere everywhere sculpture among a nation of hunters29 maritime fur trader charles william barkley also visited the area in the imperial eagle a british ship falsely flying the flag of the austrian empire american merchant seacaptain robert gray traded along the coast and discovered the mouth of the columbia river boundary disputesedit us navy admiral charles wilkes 1841 map of the oregon territory from narrative of the united states exploring expedition philadelphia 1845 initial formal claims to the region were asserted by spain in 1513 with explorer nuñez de balboa the first european to sight the pacific ocean from the americas russian maritime fur trade activity through the russianamerica company extended from the farther side of the pacific to russian america this prompted spain to send expeditions north to assert spanish ownership while captain james cook and subsequent expeditions by george vancouver advanced british claims as of the nootka conventions the last in 1794 spain gave up its exclusive a priori claims and agreed to share the region with the other powers giving up its garrison at nootka sound in the process the united states established a claim based on the discoveries of robert gray the lewis and clark expedition the construction of fort astoria and the acquisition of spanish claims given to the united states in the adams–onís treaty30 from the 1810s until the 1840s modernday washington oregon idaho and western montana along with most of british columbia were part of what the united states called the oregon country and britain called the columbia district this region was jointly claimed by the united states and great britain after the treaty of 1818 which established a codominion of interests in the region in lieu of a settlement in 1840 american charles wilkes explored in the area john mcloughlin chief factor of the hudsons bay company headquartered at fort vancouver was the de facto local political authority for most of this time this arrangement ended as us settlement grew and president james k polk was elected on a platform of calling for annexation of the entire oregon country and of texas after his election supporters coined the famous slogan fiftyfour forty or fight referring to 54°40 north latitude—the northward limit of the united states claim31 after a war scare with the united kingdom the oregon boundary dispute was settled in the 1846 oregon treaty partitioning the region along the 49th parallel and resolving most but not all of the border disputes see pig war the mainland territory north of the 49th parallel remained unincorporated until 1858 when a mass influx of americans and others during the fraser canyon gold rush forced the hand of colony of vancouver islands governor james douglas who declared the mainland a crown colony the two colonies were amalgamated in 1866 to cut costs and joined the dominion of canada in 1871 the us portion became the oregon territory in 1848 it was later subdivided into oregon territory and washington territory these territories became the states of oregon idaho washington and parts of other western states american expansionist pressure on british columbia persisted after the colony became a province of canada even though americans living in the province did not harbor annexationist inclinations the fenian brotherhood openly organized and drilled in washington particularly in the 1870s and the 1880s though no crossborder attacks were experienced during the alaska boundary dispute us president teddy roosevelt threatened to invade and annex british columbia if britain would not yield on the question of the yukon ports in more recent times during the socalled salmon war of the 1990s washington senator slade gorton called for the us navy to force the inside passage even though it is not an official international waterway disputes between british columbia and alaska over the dixon entrance of the hecate strait between prince rupert and haida gwaii have not been resolved32 geologyedit further information geology of the pacific northwest the northwest is still highly geologically active with both active volcanoes and geologic faults33 active volcanoes in the region include mount garibaldi mount baker mount rainier mount st helens mount hood mount jefferson mount shasta and glacier peak geographyedit mount rainier in washington state the pacific northwest is a diverse geographic region dominated by several mountain ranges including the coast mountains the cascade range the olympic mountains the columbia mountains and the rocky mountains the highest peak in the pacific northwest is mount rainier in the washington cascades at 14410 feet 4392 m immediately inland from the cascade range are broad generally dry plateaus in the us this region is known as the columbia plateau while in british columbia it is the interior plateau also called the fraser plateau the columbia plateau was the scene of massive iceage floods and as a consequence there are many coulees canyons and the channeled scablands much of the plateau especially in eastern washington is irrigated farmland the columbia river cuts a deep and wide gorge around the rim of the columbia plateau and through the cascade range on its way to the pacific ocean because many areas have plentiful rainfall and mild summers the pacific northwest has some of north americas most lush and extensive forests which are extensively populated with coast douglas fir trees the second tallest growing evergreen conifer on earth the region also contains specimens of the tallest trees on earth the coast redwoods in southwestern oregon but the largest of these trees are located just south of the california border in northwestern california coastal forests in some areas are classified as temperate rain forest coastal features are defined by the interaction with the pacific and the north american continent the coastline of the pacific northwest is dotted by numerous fjords bays islands and mountains some of these features include the oregon coast burrard inlet puget sound and the highly complex fjords of the british columbia coast and southeast alaska the region has one of the worlds longest fjord coastlines34 the major cities of vancouver portland seattle and tacoma all began as seaports supporting the logging mining and farming industries of the region but have developed into major technological and industrial centers such as the silicon forest which benefit from their location on the pacific rim if defined as oregon washington and british columbia the pacific northwest has four us national parks crater lake in oregon plus olympic mount rainier and north cascades in washington if a larger regional definition is used then other us national parks might be included such as redwood national and state parks glacier bay national park wrangell–st elias national park grand teton national park and parts of glacier national park and yellowstone national park there are several canadian national parks in the pacific northwest including pacific rim national park on the west coast of vancouver island mount revelstoke national park and glacier national park in the selkirk range alongside rogers pass kootenay national park and yoho national park on the british columbia flank of the rockies gwaii haanas national park reserve in haida gwaii and the gulf islands national park reserve in the strait of georgia there are numerous protected areas in british columbia and in the united states other outstanding natural features include the columbia river gorge fraser canyon mount st helens malaspina glacier and hells canyon the southcentral coast mountains in british columbia contain the five largest midlatitude icefields in the world climateedit the pacific northwest experiences a wide variety of climates an oceanic climate marine west coast climate occurs in most coastal areas typically between the ocean and high mountain ranges an alpine climate dominates in the high mountains semiarid and arid climates are found east of the higher mountains especially in rainshadow areas the harney basin of oregon is an example of arid climate in the pacific northwest humid continental climates occur inland on windward sides in places such as revelstoke british columbia a subarctic climate can be found farther north especially in yukon and alaska under the köppen climate classification a coolsummer version of the drysummer mediterranean csb designation is assigned to many areas of the pacific northwest as far north as central vancouver island and the gulf islands including cities such as victoria british columbia seattle and portland35 these zones are not associated with a typical mediterranean climate and would be classified as temperate oceanic cfb except drysummer patterns typical to the pacific northwest meet koeppens minimum cs thresholds other climate classification systems such as trewartha place these areas firmly in the oceanic zone do36 ecoregionsedit much of the pacific northwest is forested the georgia strait–puget sound basin is shared between british columbia and washington and the pacific temperate rain forests ecoregion which is the largest of the worlds temperate rain forest ecozones in the system created by the world wildlife fund stretches along the coast from alaska to california the dryland area inland from the cascade range and coast mountains is very different from the terrain and climate of the coastal area due to the rain shadow effect of the mountains and comprises the columbia fraser and thompson plateaus and mountain ranges contained within them the interior regions climates largely within eastern washington south central british columbia eastern oregon and southern idaho are a northward extension of the great basin desert which spans the great basin farther south although by their northern and eastern reaches dryland and desert areas verge at the end of the cascades and coast mountains rain shadows with the boreal forest and various alpine flora regimes characteristic of eastern british columbia northern idaho and western montana roughly along a longitudinal line defined by the idaho border with washington and oregon populationedit map of megacity showing population density shades of yellowbrown highways red and major railways black public land shown in shades of green most of the population of the pacific northwest is concentrated in the portland–seattle–vancouver corridor this area is sometimes seen as a megacity also known as a conurbation an agglomeration or a megalopolis this megacity stretches along interstate 5 in the states of oregon and washington and hwy 99 in the province of british columbia as of 2004 the combined populations of the lower mainland region which includes greater vancouver the seattle metropolitan area and the portland metropolitan area totaled around eight million people however beyond the megacity with few exceptions the pnw region is characterized by a relatively low density population distribution some other regions of greater population density outside this corridor include the okanagan valley in the british columbia interior about 350000 people centered around the city of kelowna which has close to 200000 people and the greater spokane area close to half a million large geographical areas may only have one midsized to small sized city as a regional center often a county seat with smaller cities and towns scattered around vast areas of the region may have little or no population at all largely due to the presence of extensive mountains and forests and plateaus containing both extensive farm and range lands much of which is protected from development in large parks and preserves or by zoning use regulation related to traditional land use for example all cities within the portion of california included in the pacific northwest have populations less than 100000 with that portion of the state containing millions of acres of national forests and parks list of largest cities by population in the pacific

populated urban core and rural areas west of the mountains from its less populated rural areas to their east and in british columbia and alaska north63 the coastal areas—especially in the cities of vancouver victoria bellingham seattle tacoma olympia portland eugene and ashland—are some of the most politically liberal parts of north america regularly supporting leftwing political candidates and causes by significant majorities while the interior and north tend to be more conservative and consistently support rightwing candidates and causes it should be noted that the religious right has far less influence throughout the region than elsewhere in the us and that certain areas of the bc interior particularly the west kootenay and some areas of vancouver island and the bc coast have long histories of labour environmental and social activism see history of british columbiarise of the labour movement the urban core in addition to certain rural districts is known for supporting liberal political views perceived as controversial in much of the rest of north america many jurisdictions have relatively liberal abortion laws gender equality laws legal cannabis and strong lgbt rights

communes sprung up there in the early 20th century see charles pierce lewarnes utopias on puget sound 18851915 for an overview of this popular yet forgotten movement seattle is one of a handful of major cities in north america in which the populace engaged in a general strike in 1919 and was the first major american city to elect a woman mayor bertha knight landes in 192664 socialist beliefs were once widespread thanks in large part to the areas large numbers of scandinavian immigrants and the region has had a number of socialist elected officials so great was its influence that the us postmaster general james farley jokingly toasted the fortyseven states of the union and the soviet of washington at a gala dinner in 1936 although farley denied ever saying it65 the region also has a long history of starting cooperative and communal businesses and organizations including group health66 rei puget consumers coops and numerous granges and mutual aid societies it also has a long history of publicly owned power and utilities with many of the regions cities owning their own public utilities in british columbia credit unions are common and popular cooperatively owned financial institutions east of the cascades in eastern washington and eastern oregon the population is much more conservative the eastern portions of washington and especially oregon due to their low populations do not generally have enough voting power to be competitive at the state level and thus the governorships and us senate seats of both oregon and washington are usually held by the democrats conservatism in the eastern part of the pacific northwest tends to be distrustful of federal government interference and strongly protective of gun rights economyedit agriculture fruit
