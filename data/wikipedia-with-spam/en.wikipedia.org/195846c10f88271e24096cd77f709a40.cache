users to make pointofsale purchases with their mobile devices using nearfield communication nfc technology as of september 2015 however google dropped nfc from google wallet offering the technology only through android pay which is a separate application available only to android users as a result any gift cards loyalty programs and promotional offers stored in an older version of google wallet

alternative use1314 there were no reported security problems with the nfc technology15 on march 31 2016 google announced that it was dropping support for the google wallet card as of june 30 201616

pointofsale by tapping their phone via android pay send and receive money to other individuals for free via the google wallet app keep track of spending through the optional google wallet card business modeledit google does not charge users for access to google wallet sending and receiving money is free as is adding money to a wallet card through a linked bank account there are limits on how much money users can add to their wallet balance withdraw from the linked account or card or send and receive to other individuals these limits are set per transaction and within certain time periods previously a 29 fee applied to funds added via debit card although google dropped that ability as of may 2 201619 funds sent from a wallet balance debit card or linked bank account are generally available to the recipient immediately and if the recipient has his or her own wallet account and card he or she can make an immediate withdrawal of those funds from an atm if the funds are drawn on the senders wallet balance the balance will also reflect this change immediately any portion of funds drawn via a linked bank account will take two or three days to actually post to that account though these funds will show as pending withdrawals on that account within 24 hours19 while google does not have revenue coming in from the wallet ecosystem the web service app and the wallet card the product is part of a larger suite of ecommerce products including android pay which integrates loyalty programs and promotions from other businesses securityedit google wallet protects payment credentials by storing user data on secure servers and encrypting all payment information with industrystandard ssl secure socket layer technology full credit and debit card information is never shown in the app20 all google wallet users are also required to have a pin to protect access to their wallet account the payments pin is used for gaining access to the google wallet app on a mobile device making pointofsale purchases with a google wallet card withdrawing cash with a google wallet card at an atm google also recommends having a general passcode on mobile devices for additional security in some cases users have to verify their identity in order to make certain transactions if prompted to do so the user will visit the wallet website and follow steps to ensure their accurate identity this is in adherence with us federal deposit insurance corporation financial regulations that require payment providers to ensure customer identity5 if a google wallet card is lost or stolen users can immediately cancel access to it by signing into myaccountgooglecom google also offers the additional flexibility of temporarily locking the card if a user suspects that the card has simply been misplaced in the event of unauthorized transactions google wallet fraud protection covers 100 of verified unauthorized transactions made in the us reported within 120 days of the transaction only us residents who have wallet accounts associated with a us address are eligible for coverage under this policy21 criticismedit regarding an earlier version of google wallet in 2012 an analysis by security company nowsecure revealed that some card information stored by google wallet was accessible outside of the application it is suggested that hackers could create a way to intercept data by eavesdropping on google analytics which monitors apps used on the android os a previous analysis by the same firm revealed a number of other exploits that have since been fixed22 privacyedit privacy concerns include the storing of data regarding payment information transaction details payment attempts and other information stored by google indefinitely the privacy policy for google wallet called the google payments privacy notice indicates that much of the data is stored but may not be shared outside google except under certain circumstances23 information that may be collected upon signing up includes credit or debit card number and expiration date address phone number date of birth social security number or taxpayer id number information that may be collected about a transaction made through google wallet includes date time and amount of transaction merchant’s location and description a description of goods or services purchased any photo the user associates with the transaction the names and email addresses of sender and recipient the type of payment method used and a description of the reason for the transaction if included24 the storage of such personal information about users transactions is of significant financial value to a company that earns much of its revenue from data but may be controversial to users aware of the policies25 information collected is shared with google’s affiliates meaning other companies owned and controlled by google inc which can be used for their everyday business purposes they provide the option to opt out of certain sharing capacities with these affiliates google states that it will only share personal information with other companies or individuals outside of google in the following circumstances24 as permitted under the google privacy policy as necessary to process your transaction and maintain your account to complete your registration for a service provided by a third party paypal lawsuitedit shortly after the launch of google wallets first iteration in 2011 paypal filed a lawsuit against google and two former employees of paypal – osama bedier and stephanie tilenius the complaint alleges misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of fiduciary duty the lawsuit reveals that google was negotiating with paypal for two years to power payments on mobile devices but just as the deal was about to be signed google backed off and instead hired the paypal executive negotiating the deal bedier the lawsuit notes that bedier knew all of paypals future plans for mobile payments as well as an internal detailed analysis of google’s weaknesses in the area not only that it accuses him of storing confidential information in locations such as his nonpaypal computers nonpaypal email account and an account on the remote computing service called dropbox26 google ran a competitor to paypal google checkout from 2006 to 2013 in 2011 google wallet replaced checkouts
