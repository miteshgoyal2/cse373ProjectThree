million5 a february 21 2007 survey of 3000 americans released by consultancy bridge ratings research found that as much as 19 of us consumers 12 and older listen to webbased radio stations in other words there were some 57 million weekly listeners of internet radio programs more people listen to online radio than to satellite radio highdefinition radio podcasts or cellphonebased radio combined56

internet talk radio which was the first computerradio talk show each week interviewing a computer expert1112 the first internet concert was broadcast on june 24 1993 by the band severe tire damage1314 in november 1994 a rolling stones concert was the first major cyberspace multicast concert mick jagger opened the concert by saying i want to say a special welcome to everyone thats uh climbed into the internet tonight and uh has got into the mbone and i hope it doesnt all collapse15 on november 7 1994 wxyc 893 fm chapel hill nc usa became the first traditional radio station to announce broadcasting on the internet wxyc used an fm radio connected to a system at sunsite later known as ibiblio running cornells cuseeme software wxyc had begun test broadcasts and bandwidth testing as early as august 199416 wrek 911 fm atlanta ga usa started streaming on the same day using their own custom software called cyberradio1 however unlike wxyc this was wreks beta launch and the stream was not advertised until a later date17 on december 3 1994 kjhk 907 fm a campus radio station located in lawrence kansas at the university of kansas became one of the first radio stations in the world to broadcast a live and continuous stream over internet radio 18 time magazine said that realaudio took advantage of the latest advances in digital compression and delivered am radioquality sound in socalled real time19 eventually companies such as nullsoft and microsoft released streaming audio players as free downloads20 as the software audio players became available many webbased radio stations began springing up20 in 1995 scott bourne founded netradiocom as the worlds first internetonly radio network netradiocom was a pioneer in internet radio it was the first internetonly network to be licensed by ascap netradio eventually went on to an ipo in october 1999 most of the current internet radio providers followed the path that netradiocom carved out in digital media 21 in march 1996 virgin radio london became the first european radio station to broadcast its full program live on the internet22 it broadcast its fm signal live from the source simultaneously on the internet 24 hours a day23 on may 1st 1997 radio306com now pure rock radio launched in saskatoon canada the internet only station purerockradionet celebrated 20 years on air in 2017 as the longest running canadian internet station internet radio attracted significant media and investor attention in the late 1990s in 1998 the initial public stock offering for broadcastcom set a record at the time for the largest jump in price in stock offerings in the united states the offering price was us18 and the companys shares opened at us68 on the first day of trading24 the company was losing money at the time and indicated in a prospectus filed with the securities exchange commission that they expected the losses to continue indefinitely24 yahoo purchased broadcastcom on july 20 199925 for us57 billion26 with the advent of streaming realaudio over http streaming became more accessible to a number of radio shows one such show techedge radio in 1997 was broadcast in 3 formats live on the radio live from a realaudio server and streamed from the web over http in 1998 the longest running internet radio show27 the vinyl lounge commenced netcasting from sydney australia from australias first internet radio station netfm wwwnetfmnet in 1999 australian telco telstra launched the basement internet radio station but it was later shut down in 2003 as it was not a viable business for the telco from 2000 onwards most internet radio stations increased their stream quality as bandwidth became more economical today most stations stream between 64 kbits and 128 kbits providing near cd quality audio as of 2017 the mobile app sound garden a research project of the netherlands institute for sound and vision was streaming approximately 8000 radio stations to a global audience28 us royalty controversyedit in october 1998 the us congress passed the digital millennium copyright act dmca one result of the dmca is that performance royalties are to be paid for satellite radio and internet radio broadcasts in addition to publishing royalties in contrast traditional radio broadcasters pay only publishing royalties and no performance royalties2930 a rancorous dispute ensued over how performance royalties should be assessed for internet broadcasters5263031323334 some observers said that royalty rates that were being proposed were overly burdensome and intended to disadvantage independent internetonly stations30—that while internet giants like aol may be able to afford the new rates many smaller internet radio stations will have to shut down33 the digital media association dima said that even large companies like yahoo music might fail due to the proposed rates5 some observers said that some usbased internet broadcasts might be moved to foreign jurisdictions where us royalties do not apply32 many of these critics organized savenetradioorg a coalition of listeners artists labels and webcasters31 that opposed the proposed royalty rates to focus attention on the consequences of the impending rate hike many us internet broadcasters participated in a day of silence on june 26 2007 on that day they shut off their audio streams or streamed ambient sound sometimes interspersed with brief public service announcements voiced written and produced by popular voiceover artist dave solomon35 notable participants included rhapsody live365 mtv pandora digitally imported and shoutcast some broadcasters did not participate such as lastfm that had just been purchased for us 280 million by cbs music group36 according to a lastfm employee they were unable to participate because participation may compromise ongoing license negotiations37 soundexchange representing supporters of the increase in royalty rates pointed out the fact that the rates were flat from 1998 through 2005 see above without even being increased to reflect costofliving increases they also declared that if internet radio is to build businesses from the product of recordings the performers and owners of those recordings should receive fair compensation on may 1 2007 soundexchange came to an agreement with certain large webcasters regarding the minimum fees that were modified by the determination of the copyright royalty board while the crb decision imposed a 500 per station or channel minimum fee for all webcasters certain webcasters represented through dima negotiated a 50000 cap on those fees with soundexchange38 however dima and soundexchange continue to negotiate over the per song per listener fees soundexchange has also offered alternative rates and terms to certain eligible small webcasters that allows them to calculate their royalties as a percentage of their revenue or expenses instead of at a per performance rate39 to be eligible a webcaster had to have revenues of less than us 125 million a year and stream less than 5 million listener hours a month or an average of 6830 concurrent listeners40 these restrictions would disqualify independent webcasters like accuradio digitally imported club977 and others from participating in the offer and therefore many small commercial webcasters continue to negotiate a settlement with soundexchange41 an august 16 2008 washington post article reported that although pandora was one of the nations most popular web radio services with about 1 million listeners dailythe burgeoning company may be on the verge of collapse due to the structuring of performance royalty payment for webcasters traditional radio by contrast pays no such fee satellite radio pays a fee but at a less onerous rate at least by some measures the article indicated that other web radio outfits may be doomed for the same reasons42 on september 30 2008 the united states congress passed a bill that would put into effect any changes to the royalty rate to which record labels and web casters agree while lawmakers are out of session43 although royalty rates are expected to decrease many webcasters nevertheless predict difficulties generating sufficient revenue to cover their royalty payments43 in january 2009 the us copyright royalty board announced that it will apply royalties to streaming net services based on revenue44 since then websites like pandora radio accuradio mog 8tracks and even recently google music have changed the way people discover and listen to music the webcaster settlement act of 2009 expired in january 2016 ending a 10year period in which smaller online radio stations live365 among them could pay reduced royalties to labels on january 31 2016 webcasters who are governed by rules adopted by the copyright royalty board were required to pay to soundexchange an annual nonrefundable minimum fee of 500 for each channel and station45 the fee for services with greater than 100 stations or channels being 50000 annual46 see alsoedit radio portal comparison of streaming media systems electronic commerce internet radio audience measurement tunein radio internet radio device internet radio licensing
