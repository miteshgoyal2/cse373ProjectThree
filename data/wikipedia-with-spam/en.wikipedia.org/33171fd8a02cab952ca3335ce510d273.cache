the first version of a bill to establish a commission to regulate interstate trade was introduced on january 25 1912 by oklahoma congressman dick thompson morgan he would make the first speech on the house floor advocating its creation on february 21 1912 though the initial bill did not pass the questions of trusts and antitrust dominated the 1912 election4 most political party platforms in 1912 endorsed the establishment of a federal trade commission with its regulatory powers placed in the hands of an administrative board as an alternative to functions previously and necessarily exercised so slowly through the courts56 with the 1912 presidential election decided in favor of the democrats and woodrow wilson morgan reintroduced a slightly amended version of his bill during the april 1913 special session the national debate culminated in wilsons signing of the ftc act on september 26 with additional tightening of regulations in the clayton antitrust act three weeks later the new federal trade commission would absorb the staff and duties of bureau of corporations previously established under the department of commerce and labor in 1903 the ftc could additionally challenge unfair methods of competition and enforce the clayton acts more specific prohibitions against certain price discrimination vertical arrangements interlocking directorates and stock acquisitions4

ftc bureau of consumer protectionedit the bureau of consumer protections mandate is to protect consumers against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce with the written consent of the commission bureau attorneys enforce federal laws related to consumer affairs and rules promulgated by the ftc its functions include investigations enforcement actions and consumer and business education areas of principal concern for this bureau are advertising and marketing financial products and practices telemarketing fraud privacy and identity protection etc the bureau also is responsible for the united states national do not call registry under the ftc act the commission has the authority in most cases to bring its actions in federal court through its own attorneys in some consumer protection matters the ftc appears with or supports the us department of justice bureau of competitionedit the bureau of competition is the division of the ftc charged with elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices it accomplishes this through the enforcement of antitrust laws review of proposed mergers and investigation into other nonmerger business practices that may impair competition such nonmerger practices include horizontal restraints involving agreements between direct competitors and vertical restraints involving agreements among businesses at different levels in the same industry such as suppliers and commercial buyers the ftc shares enforcement of antitrust laws with the department of justice however while the ftc is responsible for civil enforcement of antitrust laws the antitrust division of the department of justice has the power to bring both civil and criminal action in antitrust matters bureau of economicsedit the bureau of

network list of competition regulators v t e the ftc investigates issues raised by reports from consumers and businesses premerger notification filings congressional inquiries or reports in the media these issues include for instance false advertising and other forms of fraud ftc investigations may pertain to a single company or an entire industry if the results of the investigation reveal unlawful conduct the ftc may seek voluntary compliance by the offending business through a consent order file an administrative complaint or initiate federal litigation traditionally an administrative complaint is heard in front of an independent administrative law judge alj with ftc staff acting as prosecutors the case is reviewed de novo by the full ftc commission which then may be appealed to the us court of appeals and finally to the supreme court under the ftc act the federal courts retain their traditional authority to issue equitable relief including the appointment of receivers monitors the imposition of asset freezes to guard against the spoliation of funds immediate access to business premises to preserve evidence and other relief including financial disclosures and expedited discovery in numerous cases the ftc employs this authority to combat serious consumer deception or fraud additionally the ftc has rulemaking power to address concerns regarding industrywide practices rules promulgated under this authority are known as trade rules in the mid1990s the ftc launched the fraud sweeps concept where the agency and its federal state and local partners filed simultaneous legal actions against multiple telemarketing fraud targets the first sweeps operation was project telesweep9 in july 1995 which cracked down on 100 business opportunity scams in 198410 the ftc began to regulate the funeral home industry in order to protect consumers from deceptive practices the ftc funeral rule requires funeral homes to provide all customers and potential customers with a general price list gpl specifically outlining goods and services in the funeral industry as defined by the ftc and a listing of their prices11 by law the gpl must be presented to all individuals that ask no one is to be denied a written retainable copy of the gpl in 1996 the ftc instituted the funeral rule offenders program frop under which funeral homes make a voluntary payment to the us treasury or appropriate state fund for an amount less than what would likely be sought if the commission authorized filing a lawsuit for civil penalties in addition the funeral homes participate in the nfda compliance program which includes a review of the price lists onsite training of the staff and followup testing and certification on compliance with the funeral rule10 one of the federal trade commissions other major focuses is identity theft the ftc serves as a federal repository for individual consumer complaints regarding identity theft even though the ftc does not resolve individual complaints it does use the aggregated information to determine where federal action might be taken the complaint form is available online or by phone 1877idtheft the ftc has been involved in the oversight of the online advertising industry and its practice of behavioral targeting for some time in 2011 the ftc proposed a do not track mechanism to allow internet users to optout of behavioral targeting in 2013 the ftc issued a comprehensive revision of its green guides which set forth standards for environmental marketing12 unfair or deceptive practices affecting consumersedit play media endorsement guides from the ftc section 5 of the federal trade commission act 15 usc § 45 grants the ftc power to investigate and prevent deceptive trade practices the statute declares that unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce are hereby declared unlawful13 unfairness and deception towards consumers represent two distinct areas of ftc enforcement and authority the ftc also has authority over unfair methods of competition between businesses14 deception practicesedit in a letter to the chairman of the house committee on energy and commerce the ftc defined the elements of deception cases first there must be a representation omission or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer15 in the case of omissions the commission considers the implied representations understood by the consumer a misleading omission occurs when information is not disclosed to correct reasonable consumer expectations15 second the commission examines the practice from the perspective of a reasonable consumer being targeted by the practice finally the representation or omission must be a material one—that is one that would have changed consumer behavior15 in its dot com disclosures guide16 the ftc said that disclosures that are required to prevent deception or to provide consumers material information about a transaction must be presented clearly and conspicuously16 the ftc suggested a number of different factors that would help determine whether the information was clear and conspicuous including but not limited to the placement of the disclosure in an advertisement and its proximity to the claim it is qualifying the prominence of the disclosure whether items in other parts of the advertisement distract attention from the disclosure whether the advertisement is so lengthy that the disclosure needs to be repeated whether disclosures in audio messages are presented in an adequate volume and cadence and visual disclosures appear for a sufficient duration and whether the language of the disclosure is understandable to the intended audience16 however the key is the overall net impression16 in ftc v cyberspacecom17 the ftc found that sending consumers mail that appeared to be a check for 350 to the consumer attached to an invoice was deceptive when cashing the check constituted an agreement to pay a monthly fee for internet access the back of the check in fine print disclosed the existence of this agreement to the consumer the ftc concluded that the practice was misleading to reasonable consumers especially since there was evidence that less than one percent of the 225000 individuals and businesses billed for the internet service actually logged on17 in in re gateway learning corp the ftc alleged that gateway committed unfair and deceptive trade practices by making retroactive changes to its privacy policy without informing customers and by violating its own privacy policy by selling customer information when it had said it would not18 gateway settled the complaint by entering into a consent decree with the ftc that required it to surrender some profits and placed restrictions upon gateway for the following 20 years19 in in the matter of sears holdings management corp the ftc alleged that a research software program provided by sears was deceptive because it collected information about nearly all online behavior a fact that was only disclosed in legalese buried within the end user license agreement20 in 2016 the ftc launched action against the omics publishing group for its actions in producing predatory journals21 and organising predatory conferences occurred partly in response to ongoing pressure from the academic community22 this is the first action taken by the ftc against an academic journal publisher23 the complaint alleges that the defendants have been deceiving academics and researchers about the nature of its publications and hiding publication fees ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars24 and notes that omics regularly advertises conferences featuring academic experts who were never scheduled to appear in order to attract registrants22 and that attendees spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on registration fees and travel costs to attend these scientific conferences24 manuscripts are also sometimes held hostage with omics refusing to allow submissions to be withdrawn and thereby preventing resubmission to another journal for consideration23 jeffrey beall has described omics as the worstoftheworst amongst the predatory publishers2225 unfair practicesedit courts have identified three main factors that must be considered in consumer unfairness cases 1 whether the practice injures consumers 2 whether the practice violates established public policy and 3 whether it is unethical or unscrupulous14 ftc activities in the healthcare industryedit in addition to prospective analysis of the effects of mergers and acquisitions the ftc has recently resorted to retrospective analysis and monitoring of consolidated hospitals26 thus it also uses retroactive data to demonstrate that some hospital mergers and acquisitions are hurting consumers particularly in terms of higher prices26 here are some recent examples of the ftcs success in blocking or unwinding of hospital consolidations or affiliations phoebe putney memorial hospital and palmyra medical center in georgia in 2011 the ftc successfully challenged in court the 195 million acquisition of palmyra medical center by phoebe putney memorial hospital2627 the ftc alleged that the transaction would create a monopoly as it would reduce competition significantly and allow the combined phoebepalmyra to raise prices for general acutecare hospital services charged to commercial health plans substantially harming patients and local employers and employees27 the supreme court on february 19 2013 ruled in favor of the ftc27 promedica health system and st lukes hospital in ohio similarly court attempts by promedica health system in ohio to overturn an order by the ftc to the company to unwind its 2010 acquisition of st lukes hospital were unsuccessful2628 the ftc claimed that the acquisition would hurt consumers through higher premiums because insurance companies would be required to pay more28 in december 2011 an administrative judge upheld the ftcs decision noting that the behavior of promedica health system and st lukes was indeed anticompetitive and ordered promedica to divest st lukes to a buyer that would be approved by the ftc within 180 days of the date of the order2628 osf healthcare system and rockford health system in illinois in november 2011 the ftc filed a lawsuit alleging that the proposed acquisition of rockford by osf would drive up prices for general acutecare inpatient services as osf would face only one competitor swedishamerican health system in the rockford area and would have a market share of 6429 later in 2012 osf announced that it had abandoned its plans to acquire rockford health system29 see alsoedit business and
