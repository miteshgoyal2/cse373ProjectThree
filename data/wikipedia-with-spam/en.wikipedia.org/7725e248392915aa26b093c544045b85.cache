tayloredit motown ceo berry gordy brought the group to motowns hitsville usa studio in detroit michigan and assigned them to work with bobby taylor as their producer taylor who had personally brought the jacksons to motown began having michael jermaine and jackie record cover versions of current and past soul compositions including many in the motown catalog over two dozen of these recordings were done including covers of songs by the temptations i know im losing you born to love you marvin gaye chained stevie wonder my cherie amour the miracles whos lovin you and the four tops standing in the shadows of love among the nonmotown covers done were versions of sly the family stones stand the delfonics can you remember and zipadeedoodah from the walt disney film song of the south the jackson 5 also rerecorded youve changed a song they first recorded in 1967 which was released on the b side of their first local hit single big boy for the steeltown label before joining the motown rostercitation needed all of the songs taylor recorded with the jackson 5 during these summer 1969 sessions held close to the groups traditional rbsoul sound a sound somewhat less popaware than motowns signature motown sound of these recordings the most famous became the cover of whos lovin you with michael jackson redelivering smokey robinsons oftencovered plea for the return of a longgone lover the jackson 5s version of the song supplanted the miracles original as the definitive recording of the song and many of the future covers of the song for example en vogues cover at the beginning of their 1990 single hold on are based upon this versioncitation needed the jackson 5 recorded a number of songs with bobby taylor during these summer 1969 sessions that remained in the motown vault for several years including covers of ray charles a fool for you the four tops reach out ill be there the isley brothers its your thing and a version of bobby taylors own oh ive been blessed these recordings would turn up on various jackson 5 compilations and virtually all of them were included on the boxed set soulsationcitation needed the corporations involvementedit in august 1969 berry gordy decided to take a more direct role in the jackson 5s career he had the jacksons and their father joseph move from detroit to los angeles california where gordy had a satellite studio the motown operation would move to los angeles by 1972 taylor followed the group and continued to work on the cover songs during this period gordy came across i want to be free a composition written by west coastbased motown producers freddie perren alphonzo mizell and deke richards for gladys knight at first gordy wanted the three producers to instead record the song with diana ross but soon decided to give the song the frankie lymon treatment4 and record it with the jackson 5 richards mizell and perren began reworking the song and gordy and taylor also became involved in the revision process the result was i want you back which became the jackson 5s first motown single and the first of four jackson 5 songs that went to numberone on the billboard hot 100 chart in 1970 i want you back became the blueprint for future jackson 5 recordings there was now less of an emphasis on traditional soul and more prominent elements of doowop and bubblegum pop music in fact motowns publicity department dubbed the jackson 5s sound bubblegum soul gordy richards mizell and perren also contributed the album track nobody to diana ross presents the jackson 5 left out was taylor although he later performed uncredited production work on the second jackson 5 album abc and its singles all of the songs produced and written by gordy richards mizell and perren were billed under the name the corporation a
