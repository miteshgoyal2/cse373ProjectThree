vetted by the community shortcuts hipae hipaen throughout wikipedia the pronunciation of words is indicated by means of the international phonetic alphabet ipa the following tables list the ipa symbols used for english words and pronunciations please note that several of these symbols are used in ways that are specific to wikipedia and differ from those used by dictionaries if the ipa symbols are not displayed properly by your browser see the links below if you are adding a pronunciation using this key such pronunciations should generally be formatted using the template ipacen the template provides tooltips for each symbol in the pronunciation see the template page for instructions key dialect variation other transcriptions see also notes external links key if the words given as examples for two different symbols sound the same to you for example if you pronounce cot and caught the same or do and dew or marry and merry you can pronounce those symbols the same in explanations of all words the footnotes explain some of these mergers see also dialect variation below if there is an ipa symbol you are looking for that you do not see here see helpipa which is a

dictionaries published in the united states words in small capitals are the standard lexical sets words in the lexical sets bath and cloth may be given two transcriptions either with ɑː and ɔː or with æ and ɒ respectively dialect variation main article international phonetic alphabet chart for english dialects this key represents diaphonemes abstractions of speech sounds that accommodate general american received pronunciation rp and new zealand and to a large extent also australian canadian irish including ulster scottish south african and welsh but see below pronunciations therefore not all of the distinctions shown here are relevant to a particular dialect many speakers of american and canadian english pronounce cot kɒt and caught kɔːt the same you may simply ignore the difference between the symbols ɒ and ɔː just as you ignore the distinction between the written vowels o and au when pronouncing them some speakers from northern england do not distinguish the vowel of square ˈskwɛər and nurse nɜːrs if you speak such a dialect ignore the difference between the symbols ɛər and ɜːr in new zealand english the vowels of kit kɪt and focus ˈfoʊkəs have the same schwalike quality if you are from new zealand ignore the difference between the symbols ɪ and ə in new zealand english and some other dialects the vowels of near nɪər and square ˈskwɛər are not distinguished if you speak such a dialect ignore the difference between the symbols ɪər and ɛər in scottish english and ulster english the vowels of foot fʊt and goose ɡuːs are not distinguished if you speak either of those dialects ignore the difference between the symbols ʊ and uː in northern england english the vowels of foot fʊt and strut strʌt are not distinguished if you are from northern england ignore the difference between the symbols ʊ and ʌ in welsh english and some other dialects the vowels of strut strʌt and focus ˈfoʊkəs are not distinguished if you speak such a dialect ignore the difference between the symbols ʌ and ə in many dialects r occurs only before a vowel if you speak such a dialect simply ignore r in the pronunciation guides where you would not pronounce it as in cart kɑːrt in other dialects j yes cannot occur after t d n etc within the same syllable if you speak such a dialect then ignore the j in transcriptions such as new njuː for example new york is transcribed njuː ˈjɔːrk for most people from england and for some new yorkers the r in jɔːrk is not pronounced for most people from the united states including some new yorkers the j in njuː is not pronounced and may be ignored see yoddropping on the other hand there are some distinctions which you might make but which this key does not encode as they are seldom reflected in the dictionaries used as sources for wikipedia articles the vowels of kit and bit distinguished in south africa both of them are transcribed as ɪ in stressed syllables and as ɪ or ə in unstressed syllables the difference between the vowels of fir fur and fern maintained in scottish and irish english but lost elsewhere all of them are transcribed as ɜːr the vowels of pause and paws distinguished in cockney and by some estuary english speakers both of them are transcribed as ɔː or ɔːr depending on the word the vowels of bad and had distinguished in many parts of australia and the eastern united statescitation needed both of them are transcribed as æ the difference between the vowels of pain and pane found in some english welsh and newfoundland dialects both of them are transcribed as eɪ the difference between the vowels of holy and wholly found in cockney and many estuary english speakers both of them are transcribed as oʊ the vowels of spider and spied her distinguished in scotland both of them are transcribed as aɪ the vowels of rider and writer distinguished in many parts of canada and some parts of the united states both of them are transcribed as aɪ the vowels of powder and pouter distinguished in many parts of canada and some parts of the united states both of them are transcribed as aʊ other words may have different vowels depending on the speaker the pronunciation of the æ vowel in most dialects of scotland northern ireland northern england and wales has always been closer to a bbc english has moved away from the traditional nearopen front realization æ towards almost fully open front realization a and both the oxford english dictionary and the 2014 edition of gimsons pronunciation of english transcribe the vowel in lad bad cat trap with aref 10 for more extensive information on dialect variations you may wish to see the ipa chart for english dialects note that place names are not generally exempted from being transcribed in this abstracted system so rules such as the above must be applied in order to recover the local pronunciation examples include place names in much of england ending ‑ford which although locally pronounced ‑fəd are transcribed ‑fərd this is best practice for editors however readers should be aware that not all editors may have followed this consistently so for example if ‑fəd is encountered for such a place name it should not be interpreted as a claim that the r would be absent even in a rhotic dialect other transcriptions if you feel it is necessary to add a pronunciation respelling using another convention then please use the conventions of wikipedias pronunciation respelling key to compare the following ipa symbols with nonipa american dictionary conventions that may be more familiar see pronunciation respelling for english which lists the pronunciation guides of fourteen english dictionaries published in the united states to compare the following ipa symbols with other ipa conventions that may be more familiar see helpipaconventions for english which lists the conventions of eight english dictionaries published in britain australia and the united states see also if your browser does not display ipa symbols you probably need to install a font that includes the ipa good free ipa fonts include gentium and charis sil more complete a monospaced font is everson mono which is complete download links can be

stylepronunciation § entering ipa characters helpipaconventions for english helppronunciation respelling key pronunciation respelling for english notes a b in varieties with flapping t and d between a vowel and an unstressed or wordinitial vowel may be pronounced with a tap ɾ making the words latter and ladder homophonous some dictionaries such as noad transcribe those instances as ⟨d⟩ ⟨d⟩ or ⟨t̬⟩ but they are not distinguished from t or d in this notation system in those varieties the sequence nt in the same environment may also be realized as nasalized tap ɾ̃ which may sound similar or identical to n this is also not distinguished on wikipedia a b the affricates tʃ dʒ are more correctly written with ligature ties t͡ʃ d͡ʒ ties are usually not included in transcriptions on wikipedia because they do not display correctly in all browsers if the two characters ⟨ɡ⟩ and ⟨⟩ do not match and if the first looks like a ⟨γ⟩ then you have an issue with your default font see helpipa § rendering issues the phoneme hw is not distinguished from w in the many dialects with the wine–whine merger such as rp and most varieties of general american for more information on this sound see voiceless labialized velar approximant the ipa value of the letter ⟨j⟩ is counterintuitive to many english speakers however it does occur with this sound in a few english words besides hallelujah there are fjord jägermeister and jarlsberg cheese l in the syllable coda as in the words all cold or bottle is pronounced as o u w or a similar sound in many dialects through lvocalization in most varieties of english r is pronounced as an approximant ɹ although the ipa symbol r represents a trill r is widely used instead of ɹ in broad transcriptions of english a number of english words such as genre and garage may be pronounced with either ʒ or dʒ in most dialects x is replaced by k in most words including loch it is also replaced with h in some words such as chanukah a b ɒ̃ æ̃ are only found in french loanwords and often replaced by another vowel and a nasal consonant bon vivant ˌbɒn viːˈvɑːnt ensemble ɑːnˈsɑːmbəl croissant ˈkwæsɑːŋref 1ref 2ref 3 in nonrhotic accents like rp r is not pronounced unless followed by a vowel in some wikipedia articles ɪər etc may not be distinguished from ɪr etc these should be fixed to correspond with the chart here ɒ is not distinguished from ɑː in dialects with the father–bother merger such as general american some regions such as new york city and philadelphia separate this into two phonemes æ and eǝ so that the vowel in crash may be closer to that in mail than that in cat in other dialects such as general american the two sounds are allophones see æ tensing in some regions what would normally be æŋ or æɡ is pronounced as eŋ or eɪŋ eɡ or eɪɡ so that the a in rang and rag is closer to the ai in rain than the a in rat ær is pronounced the same as ɛr as in merry in accents with the mary–marry–merry merger many speakers for example in most of canada and much of the united states have a different vowel in price and ride generally an aɪ is used at the ends of words and before voiced sounds as in ride file fine pie while an ʌɪ is used before voiceless sounds as in price and write because t and d are often conflated in the middle of words in these dialects derivatives of these words such as rider and writer may be distinguished only by their vowel ˈɹaɪɾɚ ˈɹʌɪɾɚ however even though the value of aɪ is not predictable in some words such as spider ˈspʌɪɾɚref 4 dictionaries do not generally record it so it has not been allocated a separate transcription here a b c d some speakers pronounce higher flower layer stratum and mayor with two syllables and hire flour lair and mare with one others pronounce them the same a b ɛ is transcribed as e by many dictionariesref 5 ɛər is pronounced the same as ɛr as in merry in accents with the mary–marry–merry merger it is often transcribed as eə by british dictionaries and as er by american ones the oed uses ɛː for bre and ɛər for ameref 6 but the oxford online dictionaries apparently always use er for ame despite having eər in their key to us pronunciationsref 7ref 8 ɪər is pronounced the same as ɪr in accents with the mirror–nearer merger oʊ is commonly transcribed əʊ or oː a b some conservative dialects make a distinction between the vowels in horse and hoarse but the number of speakers who make this distinction is very small and many dictionaries no longer differentiate between them horse–hoarse merger the vowel in hoarse was formerly represented as ɔər on wikipedia but is now represented as ɔːr identical to horse a b c ʊər is not distinguished from ɔːr in dialects with the cure–force merger including many younger speakers in england the merger may not be fully consistent and may only apply to more common words in conservative rp and northern england english ʊər is much more commonly preserved than in modern rp and southern england english in australia and new zealand ʊər does not exist as a separate phoneme and is replaced either by the sequence uːər uːr before vowels within the same word save for some compounds or the monophthong ɔːr ɔː is not distinguished from ɒ except before r in dialects with the cot–caught merger such as many varieties of general american in dialects with yod dropping juː is pronounced the same as uː after coronal consonants t d s z n θ and l in the same syllable so that dew djuː is pronounced the same as do duː in dialects with yod coalescence tj and dj mostly merge with tʃ and dʒ so that the first syllable in tuesday is pronounced the same as choose in some dialects sj and zj are also affected and they merge with ʃ and ʒ some particularly american dictionaries notate ʌ with the same symbol as ə which is found only in unstressed syllables and distinguish it from ə only by a stress mark preceding it also note that although ⟨ʌ⟩ the ipa symbol for the openmid back vowel is used the typical modern pronunciation is rather close to the nearopen central vowel ɐ in both received pronunciation and general american ʌ is not used in the dialects of the northern half of england some bordering parts of wales and some broad eastern ireland accents these words would take the ʊ vowel there is no foot–strut split in general american ɜːr is phonetically identical to ər in received pronunciation it is pronounced as a lengthened schwa əː some dictionaries therefore use ⟨əː⟩ instead of the conventional symbol ⟨ɜː⟩ ʌr is not distinguished from ɜːr in dialects with the hurry–furry merger such as some varieties of general american i is pronounced i in dialects with the happy tensing and ɪ in others british convention used to transcribe it with ⟨ɪ⟩ but the oed and other influential dictionaries recently converted to ⟨i⟩ it is arguable that there is no phonemic distinction in english between primary and secondary stressref 9 but it is conventional to notate them as here full vowels following a stressed syllable such as the ship in battleship are marked with secondary stress in some dictionaries merriamwebster but not in others the oed syllable divisions are not usually marked but the ipa dot may be used when it is wished to make explicit where a division between syllables is or may be made references bon vivant english pronouncing dictionary 18th ed  ensemble english pronouncing
