parents most notably sarge and mama lu james referred to her mother as the mystery lady6 james received her first professional vocal training at the age of five from james earle hines musical director of the echoes of eden choir at the st paul baptist church in southcentral los angeles under his tutelage she suffered physical abuse during her formative years with her instructor often punching her in the chest while she sang to force her voice to come from her gut as a consequence she developed an unusually strong voice for a child her age8 she became a popular singing attraction and sarge tried unsuccessfully to pressure the church into compensating their family for her singing sarge like the musical director for the choir was also abusive during drunken poker games at home he would awaken jamesetta in the early morning hours and force her with beatings to sing for his friends she was a bedwetter and often soaked with urine on these occasions the trauma of her foster father forcing her to sing under these humiliating circumstances caused her to have difficulties with singing on demand throughout her career9 in 1950 mama lu died and jamess biological mother took her to the fillmore district of san francisco10 within a couple of years she began listening to doowop and was inspired to form a girl group the creolettes because of the members lightskinned complexions at the age of 14 she met the musician johnny otis stories on how they met vary in otiss version she came to his hotel after one of his performances in the city and persuaded him to audition her another story was that otis spotted the creolettes performing at a los angeles nightclub and sought for them to record his answer song to hank ballards work with me annie otis took the group under his wing helping them sign to modern records and changing their name from the creolettes to the peaches he also gave the singer her stage name transposing jamesetta into etta james james recorded the version for which she was given credit as coauthor in 1954 and the record was released in early 1955 as dance with me henry the original title of the song was roll with me henry but it was changed to avoid censorship due to the offcolor title roll connoting sexual activity in february of that year the song reached number one on the hot rhythm blues tracks chart11 its success gave the group an opening spot on little richards national tour12 while james was on tour with richard the pop singer georgia gibbs recorded a version of jamess song which was released under the title the wallflower and became a crossover hit reaching number one on the billboard hot 100 which angered james after leaving the peaches james had another rb hit with good rockin daddy but struggled with followups when her contract with modern came up for renewal in 1960 she signed a contract with chess records instead shortly afterwards she was involved in a relationship with the singer harvey fuqua the founder of the doowop group the moonglows the musician bobby murray known as taters toured with james for 20 years he wrote that james had her first hit single when she was 15 years old and went steady with bb king in memphis when she was 16 james believed that kings hit single sweet sixteen was about her13 in early 1955 she and an aspiring singer the 19yearold elvis presley then recording for sun studios and an avid fan of kings shared a bill in a large club just outside memphis in her autobiography she noted how impressed she was with the young singers manners she also recalled how happy he made her many years later when she found out that it was presley who had moved her close friend jackie wilson from a substandard convalescent home to a more appropriate facility and as she put it paid all the expenses presley died a year later wilson went on to live for another ten years in the care center presley found for him chess and warner brothers years 1960–1978edit dueting with harvey fuqua james recorded for argo records later renamed cadet records a label established by chess her first hit singles with fuqua were if i cant have you and spoonful her first solo hit was the doowop–styled rhythmandblues song all i could do was cry which was a number two rb hit14 chess records cofounder leonard chess envisioned james as a classic ballad stylist who had potential to cross over to the pop charts and soon surrounded the singer with violins and other string instruments14 the first stringladen ballad james recorded was my dearest darling in may 1960 which peaked in the top five of the rb chart james sang background vocals for her labelmate chuck berry on his back in the usa1516 her debut album at last was released in late 1960 and was noted for its varied selection of music from jazz standards to blues to doowop and rhythm and blues rb17 the album included the future classic i just want to make love to you and a sunday kind of love in early 1961 james released what was to become her signature song at last which reached number two on the rb chart and number 47 on the billboard hot 100 though the record was not as successful as expected her rendition has become the bestknown version of the song15 james followed that with trust in me which also included string instruments14 later that same year james released a second studio album the second time around the album took the same direction as her first covering jazz and pop standards and with strings on many of the songs it produced two hit singles fool that i am and dont cry baby18 james started adding gospel elements in her music the following year releasing somethings got a hold on me which peaked at number four on the rb chart and was a top 40 pop hit19 that success was quickly followed by stop the wedding which reached number six on the rb chart and also had gospel elements15 in 1963 she had another major hit with pushover and released the live album etta james rocks the house recorded at the new era club in nashville tennessee14 after a couple years of minor hits jamess career started to suffer after 1965 after a period of isolation she returned to recording in 1967 and reemerged with more gutsy rb numbers thanks to her recording at the legendary fame studios in muscle shoals alabama these sessions yielded her comeback hit tell mama cowritten by clarence carter which reached number ten rb and number twentythree pop an album of the same name was also released that year and included her take on otis reddings security20 the bside of tell mama was id rather go blind which became a blues classic and has been recorded by many other artists in her autobiography rage to survive she wrote that she heard the song outlined by her friend ellington fugi jordan when she visited him in prison21
