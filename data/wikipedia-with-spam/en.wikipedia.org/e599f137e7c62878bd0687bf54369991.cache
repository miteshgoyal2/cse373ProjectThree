network for more than two decades during its first season it ran from 9 to 10 pm et virtually every type of entertainment appeared on the show classical musicians opera singers popular recording artists songwriters comedians ballet dancers dramatic actors performing monologues from plays and circus acts were regularly featured the format was essentially the same as vaudeville and although vaudeville had undergone a slow demise for a generation sullivan presented many exvaudevillians on his show5 originally cocreated and produced by marlo lewis the show was first titled toast of the town but was widely referred to as the ed sullivan show for years before september 25 1955 when that became its official name in the shows june 20 1948 debut dean martin and jerry lewis performed along with singer monica lewis and broadway composers richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein ii previewing the score to their thennew show south pacific which opened on broadway in 1949 from 1948 through 1962 the programs primary sponsor was the lincolnmercury division of the ford motor company sullivan read many commercials for mercury vehicles live on the air during this period the ed sullivan show was originally broadcast via live television from cbstv studio 51 the maxine elliott theatre at broadway and 39th st before moving to its permanent home at cbstv studio 50 in new york city 1697 broadway at 53rd street which was renamed the ed sullivan theater6 on the occasion of the programs 20th anniversary in june 1968 the last original sullivan show telecast 1068 was on march 28 1971 with guests melanie joanna simon danny davis and the nashville brass and sandler and young repeats were scheduled through june 6 1971 backgroundedit along with the new talent sullivan booked each week he also had recurring characters appear many times a season such as his little italian mouse puppet sidekick topo gigio who debuted december 9 19627 and ventriloquist señor wences debuted december 31 19508 while most of the episodes aired live from new york city the show also aired live on occasion from other nations such as the united kingdom australia and japan for many years ed sullivan was a national event each sunday evening and was the first exposure for foreign performers to the american public on the occasion of the shows tenth anniversary telecast sullivan commented on how the show had changed during a june 1958 interview syndicated by the newspaper enterprise association nea the chief difference is mostly one of pace in those days we had maybe six acts now we have 11 or 12 then each of our acts would do a leisurely ten minutes or so now they do two or three minutes and in those early days i talked too much watching these kines i cringe i look up at me talking away and i say you fool keep quiet but i just keep on talking ive learned how to keep my mouth shut the show enjoyed phenomenal popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s as had occurred with the annual telecasts of the wizard of oz in the 1960s and 70s the family ritual of gathering around the television set to watch ed sullivan became almost a us cultural universal he was regarded as a kingmaker and performers considered an appearance on his program as a guarantee of stardom although this sometimes did not turn out to be the case the shows iconic status is illustrated by the song hymn for a sunday evening from the 1960 musical bye bye birdie in the song a family of viewers expresses their regard for the program in worshipful tones in september 1965 cbs started televising the program in compatible color as all three major networks began to switch to 100 percent color prime time schedules cbs had once backed its own color system developed by peter goldmark and resisted using rcas compatible process until 1954 at that time it built its first new york city color tv studio studio 72 in a former rko movie theater at 2248 broadway 81st street one ed sullivan show was broadcast on august 22 1954 from the new studio but it was mostly used for onetimeonly specials such as rodgers and hammersteins march 31 1957 cinderella the facility was later acquired by teletape productions and notably became the first studio where the pbs childrens program sesame street was produced cbs studio 72 was demolished in 1986 and replaced by an apartment house cbs studio 50 was finally colorized in 1965 the 1965–66 season premiere starred the beatles in an episode airing on september 12 which was the last episode to air in black and white this occurred because the episode was taped at the beatles convenience on august 14 the eve of their shea stadium performance and a twoweek tour of north america slightly before the program was ready for color transmission in the late 1960s sullivan remarked that his program was waning as the decade went on he realized that to keep viewers the best and brightest in entertainment had to be seen or else the viewers were going to keep on changing the channel along with declining viewership ed sullivan attracted a higher median age for the average viewer which most sponsors found undesirable as the seasons went on these two factors were the reason the show was canceled by cbs as part of a mass cancellation of advertiseraverse programming after the end of the 1970–1971 season because there was no notice of cancellation sullivans landmark program ended without a proper finale sullivan would produce oneoff specials for cbs until his death in 1974 in 1990 television documentary producer andrew solt formed sofa entertainment inc and purchased the exclusive rights to the complete library of the ed sullivan show from ed sullivans daughter elizabeth and her husband bob precht910 the collection consists of 1087 hours of kinescopes and videotapes broadcast by cbs on sunday nights from 1948 to 1971 since acquiring the rights to the ed sullivan show library sofa entertainment has catalogued organized and cleared performance rights for the original shows starting in 1991 sofa entertainment has reintroduced the ed sullivan show to the american public by producing numerous network specials halfhour series airing on tv land pbs vh1 and decades and home video compilations11 some of these compilations include the 4 complete ed sullivan shows starring the beatles all 6 ed sullivan shows starring the rolling stones elvis the ed sullivan shows motown gold from the ed sullivan show ed sullivans rock n roll classics and 115 halfhour the best of the ed sullivan show specials among others12131415 the legendary performances of this show are also available as video and audio downloads and an app on itunes16 the ed sullivan show orchestraedit in the early years of television both cbs and nbc networks had their own symphony orchestras nbcs was conducted by arturo toscanini and cbss by alfredo antonini the ed sullivan show was basically a musical variety show and thus members of the cbs orchestra were folded into the ed sullivan show orchestra conducted by ray bloch during the early days of television the demands on studio musicians were manytiered they needed to be proficient in all genres of music from classical to jazz and to rock and roll the ed sullivan show would regularly feature singers from the metropolitan opera and the staff orchestra would accompany divas such as eileen farrell maria callas or joan sutherland the musicians needed to be prepared to switch gears for ella fitzgerald diahann carroll or sammy davis jr and then onto the jackson five stevie wonder or tom jones or itzhak perlman they also needed to perform with some of the greatest dancers and ballerinas of the time from gregory hines juliet prowse or margo fonteyn to the peter genarro dancers few musicians are capable of crossing over from one genre to another however each member of the ed sullivan show orchestra was a specialist and more than capable of covering the complete spectrum of music music hall of fame inductee gordon chris griffin formerly with the trumpet section of harry james ziggy elman and chris griffin of the benny goodman band was ray blochs lead trumpet player for the many radio and television shows that he conducted including the ed sullivan show chris remained the lead trumpet player with the ed sullivan show from the first show in 1948 to the last show in 1971 unlike the tonight show of nbc which celebrated the notoriety of their musicians in skitch hendersons or doc severinsens band the cbs producers of the ed sullivan show decided to hide their famed musicians behind a curtain occasionally cbs would broadcast specials and they would call upon the orchestra to perform when robert kennedy was assassinated music was hastily composed for the orchestra in a special tribute that also featured bill evans who had recently composed an elegy to his father in 1971 the ed sullivan show came to an abrupt end the cbs board of directors chose this occasion to terminate any and all contracts with their musicians as they were unceremoniously shown the door famous performancesnotable guest starsedit sullivan and the beatles february 1964 the ed sullivan show is especially known to the world war ii and baby boomer generations for introducing acts and airing breakthrough performances by popular 1950s and 1960s musicians such as elvis presley the beatles the supremes the dave clark five the animals the beach boys the jackson 5 janis joplin the rolling stones the mamas the papas the lovin spoonful hermans hermits the doors and the band the canadian comedy duo wayne and shuster appeared on the program 67 times a record for any performer17 itzhak perlmanedit the american publics first exposure to itzhak perlman was on the show in 1958 when he was just 13 this performance was a breakthrough not only for classical music but also for perlman who rode the waves of admiration that came with performing on the show to new heights of fame and has remained one of the most famous violinists for decades elvis presleyedit initial appearanceedit on september 9 1956 presley made his first appearance on the ed sullivan show after earlier appearances on shows hosted by the dorsey brothers milton berle and steve allen even though sullivan had previously vowed never to allow presley on the show18 according to biographer michael david harris sullivan signed presley when the host was having an intense sundaynight rivalry with steve allen allen had the singer on july 1 and trounced sullivan in the ratings when asked to comment the cbs star said that he wouldnt consider presenting presley before a family audience less than two weeks later he changed his mind and signed a contract the newspapers asked him to explain his reversal what i said then was off the reports id heard i hadnt even seen the guy seeing the kinescopes i dont know what the fuss was all about for instance the business about rubbing the thighs he rubbed one hand on his hip to dry off the perspiration from playing his guitar 19 sullivans reaction to presleys performance on the milton berle show was i dont know why everybody picked on presley i thought the whole show was dirty and vulgar20 elvis mythology states that sullivan censored presley by only shooting him from the waist up sullivan may have helped create the myth when he told tv guide as for his gyrations the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots in truth presleys whole body was shown in the first and second shows20 at the time presley was filming love me tender so sullivans producer marlo lewis flew to los angeles to supervise the two segments telecast that night from cbs television city in hollywood sullivan however was not able to host his show in new york city because he was recovering from a near fatal automobile accident charles laughton guesthosted in sullivans place laughton appeared in front of plaques with gold records and stated these gold records four of them are a tribute to the fact that four of his recordings have sold each sold more than a million copies and this by the way is the first time in recordmaking history that a singer has hit such a mark in such a short time and now away to hollywood to meet elvis presley21 however according to greil marcus laughton was the main act of sullivans show presley was the headliner and a sullivan headliner normally opened the show but sullivan was burying him laughton had to make the moment invisible to act as if nobody was actually waiting for anything he did it instantly with complete command with the sort of television presence that some have and some—steve allen or ed sullivan himself—dont22 host laughton introduced the singer from new york once on camera elvis cleared his throat and said thank you mr laughton ladies and gentlemen wow and wiped his brow this is probably the greatest honor ive ever had in my life ah theres not much i can say except it really makes you feel good we want to thank you from the bottom of our heart and now dont be cruel which was after a short introduction by elvis followed by love me tender21 according to elaine dundy presley sang love me tender straight subdued and tender —a very different elvis from the one on the steve allen show three months before23 when the camera returned to laughton he stated well well well well well ladies and gentlemen elvis presley and mr presley if you are watching this in hollywood and i may address myself to you it has been many a year since any young performer has captured such a wide and as we heard tonight devoted audience21 elvis presley performing ready teddy elviss second set in the show consisted of ready teddy and a short onair comment to sullivan ah mr sullivan we know that somewhere out there you are looking in and ah all the boys and myself and everybody out here are looking forward to seeing you back on television next elvis declared friends as a great philosopher once said you aint nothin but a hound dog as he launched into a short 107 version of the song21 according to marcus for the first of his two appearances that night as a performer elvis had come on dressed in grandmas nightgown and nightcap concerning the singers second set in the show the author adds that there were elvis scotty moore on guitar bill black on standup bass d j fontana on drums three jordanaires on their feet one at a piano they were shown from behind the camera pulled all the way back they went into ready teddy it was little richards most thrilling record however there was no way elvis was going to catch him but he didn’t have to—the song is a wave and he rode it compared to moments on the dorsey shows on the berle show it was ice cream—elviss face unthreatening his legs as if in casts 22 when he sang little richards reddy teddy and began to move and dance the camera pulled in so that the television audience saw him from the waist up only24 although laughton was the main star and there were seven other acts on the show elvis was on camera for more than a quarter of the time allotted to all acts25 the show was viewed by a record 60 million people which at the time was 826 percent of the television audience and the largest single audience in television history in the new york times however jack gould began his review indignantly elvis presley had injected movements of his tongue and indulged in wordless singing that were singularly distasteful overstimulating the physical impulses of the teenagers was a gross national disservice26 second and third appearancesedit hound dog october 28 1956 sullivan hosted a second appearance by presley on october 28 1956 elvis performed dont be cruel then love me tender sullivan then addressed the audience as he stood beside elvis who began shaking his legs eliciting screams from the audience by the time sullivan turned his head elvis was standing motionless after presley left the stage sullivan stated i can’t figure this darn thing out you know he just does this ed shakes his legs and everybody yells elvis appeared a second time in the show and sang love me later on he sang a nearly fourminutelong version of hound dog and was shown in full the entire song for the third and final appearance on january 6 1957 presley performed a medley of hound dog love me tender and heartbreak hotel followed by a full version of dont be cruel for a second set later in the show he did too much and when my blue moon turns to gold again for his last set he sang peace in the valley according to sullivans coproducer marlo lewis the rumor had it that elvis has been hanging a small softdrink bottle from his groin underneath his pants and when he wiggles his leg it looks as though his pecker reaches down to his knee27 it was decided to shoot the singer only from the waist while he performed although much has been made of the fact that elvis was shown only from the waist up except for the short section of hound dog all of the songs on this show were ballads leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows greil marcus says elvis stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha if not a harem girl from the makeup over his eyes the hair falling in his face the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth he was playing rudolph valentino in the sheik with all stops out that he did so in front of the jordanaires who this night appeared as the four squarestlooking men on the planet made the performance even more potent28 sullivan praised elvis at the end of the show saying this is a real decent fine boy weve never had a pleasanter experience on our show with a big name than weve had with you youre thoroughly all right29—a remark that could either be interpreted as a ringing endorsement that legitimized the singer with an adult audience30 or as a somewhat hypocritical statement considering what the cbs censors had just done to his performance on that show31 eyewitness jerry schilling writes the way elvis looked out at us at that moment i thought i could see a mix of hurt over the attacks he’d been subjected to in the press and a deep pride in who he was and what he was doing32 according to historian tim parrish presleys manager colonel parker had threatened to remove elvis from the show if sullivan did not apologize for telling the press that elviss gyrations were immoral33 reflecting on the event in 1969 presley claimed that sullivan had expressed a very different opinion offcamera so they arranged to put me on television at that particular time there was a lot of controversy—you didnt see people moving—out in public they were gettin it on in the back rooms but you didnt see it out in public too much so there was a lot of controversy and i went to the ed sullivan show they photographed me from the waist up and sullivans standing over there saying sumbitch i said thank you ed thank you i didnt know what he was calling me at the time34 years later sullivan tried to sign the singer up again he phoned presleys manager col tom parker and asked about a price parker came up with a list of instructions and conditions and after hearing the demands sullivan said give elvis my best—and my sympathy and he hung up19 the singer never again appeared in sullivans show although in february 1964 at the start of the first of three broadcasts featuring the beatles see below sullivan announced that a telegram had been received from presley and parker wishing the british group luck the beatlesedit the beatles performing help in august 1965 in late 1963 sullivan and his entourage happened also to be passing through heathrow and witnessed how the beatles fans greeted the group on their return from stockholm where they had performed a television show as warmup band to local stars suzie and lill babs sullivan was intrigued telling his entourage it was the same thing as elvis all over again he initially offered beatles manager brian epstein top dollar for a single show but the beatles manager had a better idea — he wanted exposure for his clients the beatles would instead appear three times on the show at bottom dollar but receive top billing and two spots opening and closing on each show35 the beatles appeared on three consecutive sundays in february 1964 to great anticipation and fanfare as i want to hold your hand had swiftly risen to no 1 in the charts their first appearance on february 9 is considered a milestone in american pop culture and the beginning of the british invasion in music the broadcast drew an estimated 73 million viewers at the time a record for us television the beatles followed eds show opening intro performing all my loving till there was you which featured the names of the group members superimposed on closeup shots including the famous sorry girls hes married caption on john lennon and she loves you the act that followed beatles in the broadcast magician fred kaps was prerecorded in order to allow time for an elaborate set change36 the group returned later in the program to perform i saw her standing there and i want to hold your hand the following weeks show was broadcast from miami beach where muhammad ali then cassius clay was in training for his first title bout with sonny liston the occasion was used by both camps for publicity on the evening of the television show february 16 a crush of people nearly prevented the band from making it onstage a wedge of policemen were needed and the band began playing she loves you only seconds after reaching their instruments they continued with this boy and all my loving and returned later to close the show with i saw her standing there from me to you and i want to hold your hand they were shown on tape february 23 this appearance had been taped earlier in the day on february 9 before their first live appearance they followed eds intro with twist and shout and please please me and closed the show once again with i want to hold your hand the beatles appeared live for the final time on august 14 1965 the show was broadcast september 12 1965 and earned sullivan a 60percent share of the nighttime audience for one of the appearances this time they followed three acts before coming out to perform i feel fine im down and act naturally and then closed the show with ticket to ride yesterday and help although this was their final live appearance on the show the group would for several years provide filmed promotional clips of songs to air exclusively on sullivans program such as the 1966 and 1967 clips of paperback writer rain penny lane and strawberry fields forever although the appearances by the beatles elvis and the supremes are considered the most famous rock and roll performances on ed sullivan several months before elvis debuted sullivan invited bill haley his comets to perform their thencurrent hit rock around the clock in early august 1955 this was later recognized by cbs and others including music historian jim dawson in his book on rock around the clock as the first performance of a rock and roll song on a national television program africanamerican artistsedit lovelace watkinsedit lovelace watkins watkins was born in new

black talent he launched the careers of many performers by presenting them to a nationwide tv audience and ignored the criticism in an nea interview sullivan commented “ the most important thing during the first ten years of the program is that weve put on everything but bigotry when the show first started in 48 i had a meeting with the sponsors there were some southern dealers present and they asked if i intended to put on negroes39 i said yes they said i shouldnt but i convinced them i wasnt going to change my mind and you know something weve gone over very well in the south never had

makeup and costumes that they wore in the shows often providing the only visual recordings of these legendary performances by the original cast members since there were no network telecasts of the tony awards until 1967 there are traditionally no broadway performances on sunday nights allowing the actors to perform without impacting the broadway show many performances have been compiled and released on dvd as the best of broadway musicals—original cast performances from the ed sullivan show mental illness programedit in that same 1958 nea interview sullivan noted his pride about the role that the show had had in improving the publics understanding of mental illness sullivan considered his may 17 1953 telecast to be the single most important episode in the shows first decade during that show a salute to the popular broadway director joshua logan the two men were watching in the wings and sullivan asked logan how he thought the show was doing according to sullivan logan told him that the show was dreadfully becoming another one of those andtheniwrote shows sullivan asked him what he should do about it and logan volunteered to talk about his experiences in a mental institution48 sullivan took him up on the offer and in retrospect believed that several advances in the treatment of mental illness could be attributed to the resulting publicity including the repeal of a pennsylvania law about the treatment of the mentally ill and the granting of funds for the construction of new psychiatric hospitals film clipsedit occasionally sullivan would feature a hollywood actor introducing a clip from a film in which he or she currently starred burt lancaster made an appearance in 1962 speaking about robert stroud the character he portrayed in birdman of alcatraz and introducing a clip from the film and although olivier personally did not appear on the show in 1966 sullivan showed a clip from the laurence olivier othello the film version of which was then currently showing in new york49 controversiesedit bo diddleyedit on november 20 1955 africanamerican rock n roll singer and guitarist bo diddley appeared on the ed sullivan show only to infuriate sullivan i did two songs and he got mad diddley had been asked to sing tennessee ernie fords hit sixteen tons which he agreed but when he appeared on stage he forgot his cue and instead sang his 1 rb hit song that bears his name diddley later recalls ed sullivan says to me in plain words you are the first black boy—quote—that ever double crossed me i was ready to fight because i was a little young dude off the streets of chicago an him callin me black in them days was as bad as sayin nigger my manager says to me thats mr sullivan i said i don’t give a shit about mr sullivan he dont talk to me like that an so he told me he says ill see that you never work no more in show business youll never get another tv show in your life50 indeed diddley seems to have been banned from further appearances as the guitarist never did appear on the ed sullivan show again51 buddy holly and the cricketsedit on january 26 1958 for their second appearance on the ed sullivan show buddy holly and the crickets were scheduled to perform two songs sullivan wanted the band to substitute a different song for their record hit oh boy which he felt was too raucous holly had already told his hometown friends in texas that he would be singing oh boy for them and told sullivan as much during the afternoon the crickets were summoned to rehearsal at short notice but only holly was in their dressing room when asked where the others were holly replied i dont know no telling sullivan then turned to holly and said i guess the crickets are not too excited to be on the ed sullivan show to which holly caustically replied i hope theyre damn more excited than i am sullivan already bothered by the choice of songs was now even angrier he cut the crickets act from two songs to one and when introducing them mispronounced hollys name so it came out vaguely as hollered or holland in addition sullivan saw to it that the microphone for hollys electric guitar was turned off holly tried to compensate by singing as loudly as he could and repeatedly trying to turn up the volume on his guitar for the instrumental break he cut loose with a dramatic solo making clear to the audience that the technical fault wasnt his the band was received so well that sullivan was forced to invite them back for a third appearance hollys response was that sullivan did not have enough money film of the performance survives photographs taken that day show sullivan looking angry and holly smirking and perhaps ignoring sullivan jackie masonedit on october 18 1964 jackie mason allegedly gave sullivan the finger on air a tape of the incident shows mason doing his standup comedy act and then looking toward sullivan commenting that sullivan was signaling him sullivan was reportedly letting mason know by pointing two fingers that he had only two minutes left as cbs was about to cut away to show a speech by president lyndon johnson mason began working his own fingers into his act and pointed toward sullivan with his middle finger slightly separated after mason left the stage the camera then cut to a visibly angry sullivan sullivan argued with mason backstage then terminated his contract mason denied knowingly giving sullivan the middle finger and mason later claimed that he had never even heard of the gesture at that time in retaliation to protect the perceived threat to his career mason filed a libel suit at the new york supreme court which he won52 sullivan publicly apologized to mason when he appeared on the show two years later in 1966 at that time mason opened his monologue by saying its a great thrill and a fantastic opportunity to see me in person again and impersonated sullivan during his act53 mason later appeared on the show five times april 23 1967 feb 25 1968 nov 24 1968 jul 22 1969 and aug 31 1969 bob dylanedit bob dylan was slated to make his first nationwide television appearance on the ed sullivan show on may 12 1963 and intended to perform talkin john birch paranoid blues a song he wrote lampooning the john birch society and the redhunting paranoia associated with it during the afternoon rehearsal that day cbs officials told dylan they had deemed the song unacceptable for broadcast and wanted him to substitute another no this is what i want to do dylan responded if i cant play my song id rather not appear on the show he then left the studio rather than altering the act the doorsedit the doors performing light my fire september 17 1967 the doors were notorious for their appearance on the show cbs network censors demanded that lead singer jim morrison change the lyrics to their hit single light my fire by altering the line girl we couldnt get much higher before the band performed the song live on september 17 1967 however morrison sang the original line and on live television with no delay cbs was powerless to stop it54 they were never invited back to the show according to ray manzarek the band was told mr sullivan liked you boys he wanted you on six more times youll never do the sullivan show again morrison replied with glee hey man we just did the sullivan show55—at the time an appearance was a hallmark of success manzarek has given differing accounts of what happened he has said that the band only pretended to agree to change the line but also that morrison was nervous and simply forgot to change the line the performance and incident was reenacted in the 1991 biographical film the doors sullivan apparently felt the damage had been done and relented on bands using the word higher the following year sly the family stone sang a medley where sly repeated the lyric wanna take you higher56 the rolling stonesedit in contrast the rolling stones were instructed to change the title of their lets spend the night together single for the bands january 15 1967 appearance the band complied with mick jagger and bill wyman ostentatiously rolling their eyes heavenward whenever they reached the songs onenightonly clean refrain lets spend some time together mick jagger did not wear a jacket on their first appearance on the show october 25 1964 and this annoyed sullivan they were asked to appear again but they were asked to wear jackets for their 1965 appearance the stones would ultimately play on the ed sullivan show six times57 in contrast diana ross the supremes frequent guests on sullivans show debuted their thenrelease and eventually controversial 1 hit song love child on sullivans show but nothing about its title or its content about a woman in poverty having a child out of wedlock which was exceptionally taboo to mention on television at the time seemed to faze sullivan the shows producers or the network58 ratings historyedit 1948–1949 na 1949–1950 na 1950–1951 15 3723000 viewers59
