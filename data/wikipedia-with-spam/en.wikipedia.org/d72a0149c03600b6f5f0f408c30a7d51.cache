states have historically provided a conscience clause right allowing pharmacists to refrain from participating in abortions in june 2006 the pharmacy board of the washington state department of health rejected a draft rule proposed by governor christine gregoire to require all pharmacies to begin carrying plan b levonorgestrel2 governor gregoire responded by releasing a public statement warning the board members to reconsider or they could be removed2 in july 2006 the washington state human rights commission warned the board members that they would be personally liable for illegally discriminating against women if they did not pass the governor’s plan b rule2 in april 2007 the board approved a final rule prohibiting pharmacies from not stocking plan b for religious reasons but allowing exemptions for “good faith” business reasons2 when ralph’s thriftway a grocery store in olymipa refused for religious reasons to carry plan b it was widely boycotted leading gregoire to cancel the grocer’s longstanding account with the washington governors mansion2 the only complaints for violating the plan b rule were filed against the grocer2 half of washington’s hospitals are catholic3 the grocer sued but instead of alleging violations of the broader constitution of washington its attorneys at the alliance defending freedom and the becket fund for religious liberty only filed under the free exercise clause of the united states constitution4 on november 8 2007 us district judge ronald b leighton granted the grocer a preliminary injunction blocking the rule52 on may 1

richard clifton reversed910 the grocer’s petition for certiorari from the supreme court of the united states was denied on june 28 20161112 justice samuel alito joined by chief justice john roberts and justice clarence thomas dissented writing that “the rules challenged here reflect antipathy towards religious beliefs that do not accord with the views of those holding the levers of government power”1314 public records actedit in harris v quinn 2014 the supreme court of the united states gave home healthcare workers the right to not join their union15 the freedom foundation reacted by filing a public record act request for a list of home healthcare workers from the department so it could encourage the workers to leave the union15 the department refused then encouraged the service employees international union to sue the department to prevent the disclosure15 the seiu lost its lawsuit in the superior appeals and washington supreme court16 the seiu responded by putting washington initiative 1501 on the washington elections 2016 ballot which would change the public record act to forbid departments from disclosing union members’ names16 the ballot initiative was approved with 70 of the vote17 referencesedit employee directory washington state department of health retrieved on june 15 2014 washington state department of health 101 israel rd se po box 47890
