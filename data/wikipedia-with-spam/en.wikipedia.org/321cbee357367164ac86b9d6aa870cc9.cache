studio album jackson released in almost five years since the release of thriller bad was the third and final musical collaboration between jackson and quincy jones it was produced by jones with coproduction credit given to jackson7 jackson began recording demos for the anticipated followup to thriller a few months after the 1984 victory tour with the jacksons and throughout 1985 while

between january 5 1987 and july 9 198779 at westlake audio where a special wooden stage was built to allow jackson to dance while recording10 jackson wrote a reported 60 songs for the new album and recorded 30 wanting to use them all on a 3disc set8 jones had suggested that the album be cut down to a tentrack single lp8 when the album was released on cd a bonus 11th track leave me alone was included7 it was later released as a single later reissues of the lp also include this song jackson was credited for writing nine out of eleven of the songs on the album8 other writing credits included terry britten and graham lyle for just good friends and siedah garrett and glen ballard for man in the mirror7 composition and lyricsedit bad 1987 a 25second sample of jacksons bad song where the chorus is played the songs lyrics pertain to boasting which was viewed by some music critics as jackson referring to his stardom problems playing this file see media help the albums song lyrics relate to romance and paranoia the latter being a recurring theme in jacksons albums2 stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic noted that bad moved jackson deeper into hard rock deeper into schmaltzy adult contemporary deeper into hard dance – essentially taking each portion of thriller to an extreme while increasing the quotient of immaculate studiocraft2 dirty diana the lyrics to dirty diana pertain to a sexual predator but unlike billie jean the sexual challenge is optional11 problems playing this file see media help bad was originally intended as a duet between jackson and musician prince8 other artists that were supposed to be featured on the album included diana ross whitney houston aretha franklin and barbra streisand but none of those collaborations ended up happening8 the song was viewed as a revived hit the road jack progression with lyrics that pertain to boasting11 dirty diana was viewed by allmusics stephen thomas erlewine as misogynistic2 and its lyrics describing a sexual predator do not aim for the darkness of billie jean instead sounding equally intrigued by and apprehensive of a sexual challenge while having the opportunity to accept or resist it11 leave me alone was described as being a paranoid anthem2 man in the mirror was seen as jackson going a step further and offering a straightforward homily of personal commitment which can be seen in the lyrics im starting with the man in the mirrorim asking him to change his waysand no message could have been any clearerif you wanna make the world a better placetake a look at yourself and then make a change11 the lyrics to speed demon are about driving fast12 the way you make me feel 1987 the way you make me feel is the albums token love song which was written by jackson problems playing this file see media help liberian girls lyrics were viewed as glistening with gratitude for the existence of a loved one11 smooth criminals recalled the popcornchomping manner of thriller11 the track was thought of as an example of jacksons freeform language that keeps people aware that we are on the edge of several realities the film the dream it inspires the waking world it illuminates11 the music in i just cant stop loving you a duet with siedah garrett consisted mainly of finger snaps and timpani11 just good friends a duet with stevie wonder was viewed by critics as sounding good at the beginning of the song ending with a chinbobbing cheerfulness11 the way you make me feels music consisted of blues harmonies13 the lyrics of another part of me deal with being united as we13 releaseedit jackson

critical receptionedit professional ratings review scores source rating allmusic 2 encyclopedia of popular music 58 entertainment weekly b59 los angeles times 60 musichound rb 35561 rolling stone 11 the rolling stone album guide 62 the village voice b63 in a contemporary review for the new york times jon pareles called bad a wellmade catchy dance record by an enigmatic pop star he said while nothing on the record compared to wanna be startin somethin the musics concocted synthesizerdriven arrangements were clear and carried a solid kick13 in usa today edna gundersen called it jacksons most polished effort to date that is calculated but not sterile64 davitt sigerson from rolling stone wrote that even without a milestone recording like billie jean bad is still a better record than thriller he believed the filler such as speed demon dirty diana and liberian girl made bad richer sexier and better than thrillers forgettables11 richard harrington of the washington post felt that while the album could not live up to postthriller expectations it would be considerably fairer to compare bad with off the wall his overall opinion on bad was that it was a very good record that is immaculately produced and with some scintillating vocal performances from jackson65 richard cromelin of the los angeles times called bad a fairtostrong array of soul and rock blends commenting that the record was not bad and was more reminiscent of off the walls uniform strength than thrillers peaks and valleys cromelin felt that it would be disappointing if this albums creative level is where jackson wants to stay66 robert christgau was more critical in the village voice he said its studio mastery along with jacksons rhythmic and vocal power had made for the strongest and most consistent black pop album in years but lamented its lack of genius in the vein of beat it or billie jean and panned the underlying themes in jacksons lyrics hes against burglary speeding and sex dirty diana is as misogynistic as any piece of metal suckmycock in favor of harmonic convergence and changing the world by changing the man in the mirror his ideal african comes from liberia and he claims moonwalking makes him a righteous brother like shit63 bad was the recipient of six grammy award nominations winning two in 1988 it was nominated for album of the year best pop vocal performance – male best rb vocal performance – male67 and record of the year for man in the mirror the following year68 bad won best engineered recording – non classical in 198867 and best music video – short form for leave me alone in 199069 in a retrospective review for allmusic stephen thomas erlewine stated that jackson approached bad much the same way he approached thriller which was to take the basic formula of the predecessor expand it slightly and move it outward while the album rebounds with songs that prove mechanical can be tolerable if delivered with hooks and panache it still made bad feel like an artifact of its time instead a piece of music that transcends it according to erlewine2 in the encyclopedia of popular music colin larkin wrote in musical terms bad certainly broke no fresh ground appealing though its soft funk confections were they lacked substance and represented only a cosmetic advance over his two earlier albums with quincy jones58 joseph vogel was more enthusiastic about the record on bad jacksons music is largely about creating moods visceral emotions and fantastical scenarioswith each song working as a dream capsule inviting the listener into a vivid new sound story space he called bad a compelling phantasmagorical album which a handful of critics recognized from the beginning70 legacyedit jackson wore a goldplated military styled jacket with a belt during the bad era to give himself an edgier look8 bad made history as being the first album to have five of its singles peak at number one on the billboard hot 100 consecutively as i just cant stop loving you bad the way you make me feel man in the mirror and dirty diana all charted at number one on the music chart the record has still not been surpassed8 but was tied years later by katy perrys teenage dream which spawned the numberone singles california gurls teenage dream firework et and last friday night tgif between 2010 and 2011 becoming the only one other album to achieve this71 jayson rodriguez of mtv noted that following the twin cannons that were off the wall and thriller wouldnt be an easy task for most but jacksons followup 1987s bad was formidable by all accounts18 rodriguez commented that the album was wrongfully dismissed by critics because it wasnt the sales blockbuster that thriller was and that during the bad era jacksons vocal hiccups and stammered shamone would become staples in his music that were heightening and highlighting the emotion of his lyrics18 rolling stone commented that the best way to view bad was not as the sequel to thriller11 in 2009 vh1 said of the album understandably the expectations for the album were ridiculously high and grew even higher after jackson planned duets with the likes of prince on the title track and whitney houston and aretha franklin and barbra streisand none of those collaborations ended up happening but they only increased the hype for the album bad was a deeply personal project for jackson – he wrote nine of the 11 songs – one that saw him gain further independence and debut a harderedged look and sound8 in 2009 jim farber of the daily news wrote that bad streamlined the quirks of jacksons two previous albums to create his most smooth work of pop to date72 a writer for the daily telegraph commented that while bad was another worldwide commercial success the album inevitably failed to match the success of thriller despite jacksons massive and grueling world tour73 in 2009 a writer for the miami herald reflected back on the anticipation for bad describing the albums release as being the most hotly anticipated album in history74 that same year stephen m silverman a writer for people magazine viewed bad as being when some slippage in jacksons popularity began to show75 in july 2016 it was announced by the official charts company that bad was the ninth bestselling album in british history with sales of 4 million units charting behind thriller76 bad along with other studio albums
