that changed america 2005 kathleen rooney describes winfrey as a serious american intellectual who pioneered the use of electronic media specifically television and the internet to take reading – a decidedly nontechnological and highly individual act – and highlight its social elements and uses in such a way to motivate millions of erstwhile nonreaders to pick up books when author jonathan
