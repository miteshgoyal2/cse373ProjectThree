seltenheim golf course klagenfurtseltenheim austria although a specialty within landscape design or landscape architecture golf course architecture is considered a separate field of study some golf course architects become celebrities in their own right such as robert trent jones jr others are professional golfers of high standing and demonstrated appreciation for golf course composition such as jack nicklaus the field is partially represented by the american society of golf course architects the european institute of golf course architects and the society of australian golf course architects though many of the finest golf course architects in the world choose not to become members of any such group as associations of architects are not governmentsanctioned licensing bodies but private groups while golf courses often follow the original landscape some modification is unavoidable this is increasingly the case as new courses are more likely to be sited on less optimal land bunkers and sand traps are almost always artificial although other hazards may be natural fairway at lord howe golf course lord howe island nsw australia the layout of a fairway follows certain traditional principles such as the number of holes nine and 18 being most common their par values and the number of holes of each par value per course it is also preferable to arrange greens to be close to the tee box of the next playable hole to minimize travel distance while playing a round and to vary the mix of shorter and longer holes combined with the need to package all the fairways within what is frequently a compact square or rectangular plot of land the fairways of a course tend to form an oppositional tiling pattern in complex areas two holes may share the same tee box fairway or even green it is also common for separate teeoff points to be positioned for men women and amateurs each one respectively lying closer to the green eighteenhole courses are traditionally broken down into a front 9 holes 19 and a back 9 holes 1018 on older courses especially links courses like the old course at st andrews the holes may be laid out in one long loop beginning and ending at the clubhouse and thus the front 9 is referred to on the scorecard as out heading out away from clubhouse and the back 9 as in heading back in toward the clubhouse more recent courses and especially inland courses tend to be designed with the front 9 and the back 9 each constituting a separate loop beginning and ending at the clubhouse this is partly for the convenience of the players and the club as then it is easier to play just a 9hole round if preferred or stop at the clubhouse for a snack between the front 9 and the back 9 water feature at the shell point golf course iona florida a successful design is as visually pleasing as it is playable with golf being a form of outdoor recreation the strong designer is an adept student of natural landscaping who understands the aesthetic cohesion of vegetation water bodies paths grasses stonework and woodwork among other elements paredit most golf courses have only par3 4 and 5 holes though some courses include par6 holes the ananti cc and the satsuki golf course in sano japan are the only courses with par 7 holes2 typical distances for the various holes from standard tees are as follows men par 3 – 250 yards 230 m and below par 4 – 251–450 yards 230–411 m par 5 – 451–690 yards 412–631 m par 6 – 691 yards 632 m or more women par 3 – 210 yards 190 m and below par 4 – 211–400 yards 193–366 m par 5 – 401–575 yards 367–526 m par 6 – 575 yards 526 m or more harder or easier courses may have longer or shorterdistance holes respectively terrain can also be a factor so that a long downhill hole might be rated par 4 but a shorter uphill or severely treacherous hole might be rated par 5 tournament players will usually play from a longerdistance tee box the championship or tournament tee that is behind the standard mens tee which increases the typical distance of each par a par3 hole can be up to 290 yards 270 m and longer par4 holes can measure up to 520 yards 480 m which can also be accomplished by converting a par5 hole into a long par4 hole for tournament players this compensates for the generally longer distance pro players can put on tee and fairway shots as compared to the average bogey golfer partsedit teeing areaedit tee for the first hole at the links at spanish bay the game of golf is played in what is called a round this consists of playing a set number of holes in an order predetermined by the course when playing on an 18hole course each hole is played once whereas on a ninehole course each hole can be played twice to complete a round to begin a hole players start by striking the ball off a tee playing the ball off a tee can only be used on the first shot of every hole although it is not required to use a tee on the first shot tees are a small wooden or plastic peg used to hold the ball up so that when hit by the club the ball travels as far as possible the first section of every hole consists of the teeing ground or teebox there is typically more than one available box where a player places his ball each one a different distance from the hole and possibly with a different angle of approach to the green or fairway to provide differing difficulty the teeing ground is generally as level as feasible with closely mown grass very similar to that of a putting green and most are slightly raised from the surrounding fairway each tee box has two markers showing the bounds of the legal tee area the teeing area spans the distance between the markers and extends twoclub lengths behind the markers a golfer may play the ball standing outside the teeing area but the ball itself must be placed and struck from within the area3 a golfer may place his ball directly on the surface of the teeing ground called hitting it off the deck or the ball may be supported by a manufactured tee limited to a height of four inches or by any natural substance such as a mound of sand placed on the teeing surface the tee markers are often colorcoded for easy identification of the tee box the order of colors their names where appropriate and the distance of each tee to the hole is provided on the scorecard andor on signs identifying each hole most us courses have four tee boxes4 red closest to the hole and often placed to minimize the influence of major hazards like water typically used by ladies of all ages juniors up to age 12 and novice players of any agegender gold next farthest typically used by teenage boys lowhandicap ladies and senior or highhandicap men white farther still typically used by lowtoaveragehandicap men and lowhandicap teenage boys black or blue the farthest tee from the hole and with the most exposure to any major hazards typically used only during tournaments or by zerohandicap scratch male players there may be additional tees available depending on the course and they may be labeled or colored differently depending on the club and its normal patronage a club catering to senior players for instance may offer an additional tee further forward of the ladies tee labeled for senior ladies a municipal course may label a similarly placed tee the junior or novice tees silver and gold may be used to denote senior ladies and mens tees with the regular mens tee being white and the tournament tee being blue in casual play the tee a player hits from is usually their prerogative there is no rule prohibiting a man from hitting off the closest tee box nor any prohibiting a woman from using the tournament tee but players will generally gravitate toward the traditional tee for their gender andor age as this will provide the best results given a players nominal drive distance groups are often encouraged to compromise on one tee box as this speeds the groups play in tournaments golfers generally tee off from the box one level further from the normal box for their class men use the tournament tee ladies use the senior or mens tee and juniors use the ladies tee fairway and roughedit typical doglegs left dogleg left right double dogleg after the first shot from the tee teeing off the player whose ball is farthest from the green hits the ball from where it came to rest known as its lie when the ball is in play and not out of bounds or in a hazard you must play the ball as it lies5 the area between the tee box and the putting green where the grass is cut even and short is called the fairway the area between the fairway and the outofbounds markers and also between a mowed apron surrounding the green and out of bounds is the rough the grass there is cut higher and is often of a coarser strain than on the fairways making roughs disadvantageous areas from which to hit on par3 holes the player is expected to be able to drive the ball to the green on the first shot from the tee box on holes longer than par 3 players are expected to require at least one additional shot to reach their greens while many holes are designed with a direct lineofsight from the teeing ground to the green a hole may bend either to the left or to the right this is called a dogleg in reference to the similarity to a dogs ankle the hole is called a dogleg left if the hole angles leftwards and a dogleg right if the hole angles rightwards a holes direction may bend twice which is called a double dogleg fairway and rough spur valley golf course radium hot springs canada just as there are goodquality grasses for putting greens there are goodquality grasses for the fairway and rough the quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to take a divot effectively the ability to hit down into the ball hitting the ball first then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc fairways on prestigious tours like the pga tour are cut low mowing heights influence the play of the course for example the grass heights at us open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult one example of this is the infamous roughs at us opens which are often 3 to 5 inches high depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be this makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot variants of grass used for fairways and roughs include bent grass tifway 419 bermuda grass6 rye grass kentucky bluegrass and zoysiagrass as in puttinggreen grass types not every grass type works equally well in all climate types greensedit the 18th hole at the old head golf links on the old head of kinsale the putting green or simply the green is an area of very closely trimmed grass on relatively even smooth ground surrounding the hole allowing players to make precision strokes on it to putt is to play a stroke on this surface usually with the eponymous putter club which has very low loft so that the ball rolls smoothly along the ground and hopefully into the cup the shape and topology of the green can vary almost without limit but for practical purposes the green is usually flatter than other areas of the course though gentle slopes and undulations can add extra challenge to players who must account for these variations in their putting line the green typically does not include any fully enclosed hazards such as sand or water however these hazards can be – and often are – placed adjacent to the green and depending on the shape of the green and surrounding hazards and the location of the hole which often changes from day to day to promote even wear of the turf of the green there may not be a direct putting line from a point on the green to the cup golfers use a method known as reading the green to enhance their chances of making a putt reading a green involves determining the speed grain incline decline and tilt of the green on the line of the putt most putts are not struck directly at the hole instead they must be struck to take into account the characteristics of the green to arrive at the hole at the proper angle and speed the best players will read the green by walking around the green and studying the characteristics of the green before addressing the ball reading the green and putting are considered by many golfers to be the most difficult part of the game the green is typically surrounded by slightly higher grass cut at a height between that of the green and fairway and then by the fairway andor rough this longer grass surrounding the green is known as the fringe and is designed to slow and stop balls rolling along the green from an approach shot or errant putt preventing them from exiting the green though putting strokes can be made on it the higher grass can interfere with the path of the ball so players often choose to use a lofted club such as an iron to make a chip shot or a bump and run where the ball carries in the air for a few yards and then rolls along the green like a normal putt the grass of the putting green more commonly just green is cut very short so that a ball can roll for a long distance the most common types of greens for cold winter but warmer summer regions ie not extremely warm as in the southern and southwestern united states are bent grass greens a green may consist of a thin carpet so that bad weather is not allowed to become a serious factor in maintaining the course these are considered the best greens because they may be cut to an extremely low height and because they may be grown from seed bent grass does not have grain which makes it superior as a putting surface however bent grass may become infested with poa annua a costly and timeconsuming weed augusta national is one of many golf courses to use this type of green the original design of augusta national did not include bent grass greens but in the 1980s the controversial decision was made to convert the greens from bermuda to bent grass this has affected the speed and playing of augusta nationalcitation needed many other golf courses subsequently made the decision to change from bermuda to bent grass when they observed increased business at courses that had already changed overcitation needed7 another type of grass common for greens is tifdwarf hybrid bermuda other variants exist but tifdwarf is one of the most common or simply bermuda grass bermuda is more common in regions that have very warm summers and mild winters such as the southern and southwestern united states red bridge golf course was the first course in north carolina to utilize a special bermuda called mini verde a green is generally established from sod which has had the soil washed off of it to avoid soil compatibility problems and which is then laid tightly over the green then rolled and topdressed with fine sand another common and more economical approach for establishing a putting green is to introduce hybrid bermuda spriggs the stolon of the grass which are raked out at the sod farm which are laid out on the green the best greens are always established vegetativelyclarification needed and never from seed flagstick at spur valley golf course two downside factors of bermuda greens are cost of maintenance and also the existence of grain the growth direction of the blades of grass which affects the balls roll and which is called the grain of the green the slope or break of the green also affects the roll of the ball the hole or cup is always found within the green and must have a diameter of 108 millimeters 425 in and a depth of at least 10 centimeters 394 in its position on the green is not fixed and typically is changed daily by a greenskeeper in order to prevent excessive localized wear and damage to the turf a new hole will be cut by a device that removes a plug of the turf from the ground and the reinforced cup is then moved before the old hole is filled in with the plug cut from the new hole and levelled the hole has a flag on a metal pole positioned in it so that it may be seen from a distance but not necessarily from the tee this location marker is officially called the flagstick but is also commonly referred to as the pin putting greens are not all of the same quality the finestquality greens are wellkept so that a ball will roll smoothly over the closely mowed grass excess water can be removed from a putting green using a machine called a water hog golfers describe a green as fast if a light stroke on the ball makes it roll a long distance conversely on a slow green a stronger stroke is necessary to roll the ball the same distance the exact speed of a green can be determined with a stimp meter by collecting sample measurements golf courses can be compared in terms of average green speed it is however illegal by the rules of golf to test the speed of a green while playing by rolling a ball on it or by feeling or rubbing the green hazardsedit main article hazard golf water hazard sand trap and dense vegetation on the 13th hole at ridgefield golf course connecticut holes often include hazards which are special areas that have additional rules for play and are generally of two types 1 water hazards such as ponds lakes and rivers and 2 bunkers or sand traps special rules apply to playing a ball that falls in a hazard for example a player may not touch the ground or water with their club before playing the ball not even for a practice swing a ball in any hazard may be played as it lies without penalty if it cannot be played from the hazard the ball may be hit from another location generally with a penalty of one stroke the rules of golf specify exactly the point from which the ball may be played outside a hazard bunkers are small to medium areas usually lower than the fairway but of varying topography that are filled with sand and generally incorporate a raised lip or barrier it is more difficult to play the ball from sand than from grass as the ball may embed itself into the sand and the loose nature of the sand and more severe sloping of many bunkers make taking ones stance more difficult as in any hazard a ball in a bunker must be played without touching the sand with the club except during the stroke and loose impediments leaves stones twigs must not be moved before making the stroke courses may also have other design features which the skilled player will avoid there are earth bunkers pits or depressions in the ground that are not filled with sand but require a lofted shot to escape high grass and other dense vegetation trees or shrubs ravines and other rocky areas steep inclines etc while disadvantageous to play from these are typically not considered hazards unless specifically designated so by the course a ravine or creekbed may be termed a water hazard even if completely dry driving rangeedit main article driving range practice range with 43 tees 20 covered often a golf course will include among its facilities a practice range or driving range usually with practice greens bunkers and driving areas markers showing distances are usually included on a practice range for the golfers information driving ranges are also commonly found as separate facilities unattached to a golf course where players may simply hit balls into the range for practice or enjoyment there may even be a practice course often shorter and easier to play than a fullscale course where players may measure the distance they can obtain with a specific club or in order to improve their swing technique practice courses often consist of old holes of a previous design that are kept and maintained for practice purposes or as substitute holes if one or more holes become unplayable a 21hole golf course for instance will have three additional holes that can be used for practice or as substitutes for a flooded or otherwise damaged hole typesedit linksedit main article links golf domburgsche a links course in the netherlands links is a scottish term from the old english word hlinc  rising ground ridge describing coastal sand dunes and sometimes similar areas inland8 it is on links land near the towns of central eastern scotland that golf has been played since the 15th century9 the shallow top soil and sandy subsoil made links land unsuitable for the cultivation of crops or for urban development and was of low economic value the links were often treated as common land by the residents of the nearby towns and were used by them for recreation animal grazing and other activities such as laundering clothes the closely grazed turf and naturally good drainage of the links was ideal for golf and areas of longer grass heather low growing bushes and exposed sand provided the hazards that are familiar on modern courses although early links courses were often close to the sea it was rarely used as a hazard perhaps due to the instability of the dunes closest to the water and the high cost of handmade golf balls precluding anything that could result in their irrecoverable loss the land is naturally treeless and this combined with their coastal location makes wind and weather an important factor in links golf traditional links courses are often arranged with holes in pairs along the coastline players would play out from the town through a series of holes to the furthest point of the course and then would return in along the second set of holes9 the holes may share fairways and sometimes greens such as at st andrews to economize on land use but in modern times this is rare due to the potential for injury from balls coming the other way famous links courses include the old course at st andrews often described as the home of golf and musselburgh links which is generally regarded as the first recorded golf course the open championship the oldest of golf’s major championships is always played on a links course10 links and linksstyle golf courses have been developed throughout the world reproducing the broken treeless terrain with deep bunkers of their scottish prototypes executiveedit an executive course or short course is a course with a total par significantly less than that of a typical 18hole course two main types exist a 9hole course typically the type referred to as an executive course has only 9 holes instead of 18 but with the otherwise normal mix of par3 par4 and par5 holes typically producing a par score of between 34 and 36 and the course can be played through once for a short game or twice for a full round a par3 course has either 9 or 18 holes and the distance of each hole is a par 3 rating typically 240 yards or less from the mens tee with no par4 or par5 holes mandating shots through the green though occasionally a par3 course may feature a par4 or even a par5 hole as a result the total par for 18 holes of a par3 course would be 54 instead of a typical 6872 some par3 courses still require the use of a wood on some tee shots and thus a complete set of clubs is used a common standardized type of par3 course is the pitch and putt course where each of the 9 or 18 holes has a distance from tee to cup of less than 100 yards with an overall 18hole course distance no more than 1200 yards so each hole averages 67 yards this allows the course to be played without a full set of clubs typically only wedges are needed possibly a 9iron for the longest holes along with a putter to play the course the rules for formal pitch and putt competitions mandate a threeclub limit consisting of two irons and one putter these types of courses provide a faster pace of play than a standard course and get their name from their target patronage of business executives who would play the course on a long lunch or as part of a meeting they are also popular with young professionals because during the normal golf season the course can usually be played in the time between the end of the work day and sundown the popularity of the 9hole course has waned in recent decades a full 18hole course still allows for the player to play only the front nine or back nine as a shorter game while attracting more golfers seeking to play a traditional full round of 18 distinct holes many older executive courses have been upgraded inplace to 18 holes and a traditional par score or the original course was sold for other development and new land was acquired and built into an 18hole course by contrast par3 courses especially pitch and putt are rising in popularity as a compromise between the long play time and high skill levels required of a traditional 18hole course and the artificial nature and singleminded putting focus of miniature golf pitch and putt specifically its governing association the ippa has received financial support and logo rights from the ra in 2014 the pga tour held a champions tour event on a ninehole par3 course the big cedar lodge legends of golf in ridgedale missouri with four regular division or three over65 division rounds played over the par3 course and one round played on a nearby regulation 18hole course with par of 71 pitch and puttedit the par 3 or pitch and putt course in shibden hall england pitch and putt is an amateur sport similar to golf and is also known as chip and putt the maximum hole length for international competitions is 90 metres 100 yd with a maximum total course length of 1200 metres 1310 yd players may only use three clubs one of which must be a putter the game is played from raised artificial teeing surfaces using a tee and it has its own handicap system11 ownership and managementedit see also golf course superintendent greenskeeper turf management § golf courses equipment manager § golf and groundskeeping there are three main categories of ownership and management of a golf course private commercial and municipal12 privateedit a private course is owned and managed by a golf club on behalf of its members on a nonprofit basis many of the courses opened during the golf booms in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are of this type13 some courses such as augusta national are highly exclusive and will only allow visitors to play at the invitation of and alongside a member of the club others allow visitors at certain times but may insist on advance booking and proof of golfing competency commercialedit a commercial course is owned and managed by a commercial organisation and is operated for profit they may be constructed to provide a core or supplementary attraction for visitors to a hotel or commercial resort as the centrepiece to a real estate development as an exclusive country club or as a pay and play course open to the general public notable examples include pinehurst in the usa and gleneagles in scotland municipaledit a municipal course is owned and managed by a local government body for the benefit of residents and visitors some of the historic scottish golf courses including st andrews and carnoustie fall into this category along with bethpage in the usa and many others of less renown it is increasingly common for the management of municipal courses to be contracted out to commercial or other organisations or the course to be sold or shut down completely14 associated clubsedit many commercial and municipal establishments have associated golf clubs who arrange competitions for their members on the courses and may provide clubhouse facilities in the uk particularly some older private members clubs have an associated artisan club originally established to provide lowcost golf with limited playing rights in exchange for unpaid work on the course13 these associated clubs may be totally independent organisations from the course management or may have various degrees of formal or informal links environmental impactedit golf course in grindavík iceland in may 2011 amid the barren lava fields environmental concerns over the use of land for golf courses have grown since the 1960s specific issues include the amount of water required for irrigation and the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in maintenance as well as the destruction of wetlands and other environmentally important areas during construction the united nations estimates that worldwide golf courses consume about 25 billion gallons95 billion litres of water per day many golf courses are now irrigated with nonpotable water and rainwater in 1988 the us environmental protection agency prohibited the use of diazinon on golf courses and sod farms because of its negative impact on bird species environmental concerns along concerns with cost and human health have led to research into more environmentally sound practices and turf grasses golf course superintendents are often trained in the uses of these practices and grasses this has led to significant reduction in the amount of both water and chemicals on courses golf course turf is an excellent filter for water and has been used in communities to cleanse grey water such as incorporating them into bioswales the use of natural creeks and ponds is generally desirable when designing a golf course for their aesthetics and the increase in playing difficulty however such areas also typically include wetlands within the flood plain that are unsuitable for golfing and are often filled in and raised to remain dry in arid areas dry creek beds can be marked as water hazards but the importation of nonnative grasses and other plant life can have a detrimental effect on native landscapes often requiring nonnative soil and large quantities of water and fertilizer to maintain the course in these areas course builders are often prohibited from growing and maintaining nonnative grass on areas of the course other than the fairway or even on the fairway itself in which case only greens are allowed to have grass in the us land administered by the army corps of engineers such as those bordering levees and lakes is often desirable for building courses due to the scenic natural views and the unsuitability of the land for other purposes due to it lying in a planned flood plain in these cases the course designer must work with the corps of engineers to plan a course layout that protects environmentally sensitive areas provides for a means of quick escape in case of flooding and does not invite players to hit into or toward controlled structures such as levees or dams environmentalists and other activists continue to lobby against the building of new golf courses claiming they may impede corridors for migrating animals and damage sanctuaries for birds and other wildlife though some courses have become havens for native and nonnative creatures a result of modern equipment is that todays players can hit the ball much farther than previously as a result because of demand from course customers who possess this enhanced equipment and also out of an expressed concern for safety golf course architects have had to lengthen and widen golf courses where a 7000yard course used to be a great rarity courses measuring 7500yards are now not uncommon and courses of 8000yards are being contemplated all this has led to a tenpercent increase in the acreage required to build a typical course at the same time water restrictions established by communities have forced courses to limit the amount of maintained turf grass while most modern 18hole golf courses occupy as much as 60 hectares 150 acres of land the average course has 30 hectares 74 acres of maintained turf15 golf courses can be built on sandy areas along coasts on abandoned farms among strip mines and quarries and in deserts and forests many western countries have instituted environmental restrictions on where and how courses are allowed to be built1617 in some parts of the world attempts to build courses and resorts have led to protests vandalism and violence populists perceive golf as an elitist activity and thus golf courses become a target for popular opposition resisting golf tourism and golfs expansion has become an objective of some landreform movements especially in the philippines and indonesia in the bahamas opposition to golf developments has become a national issue residents of great guana cay and bimini for example are engaged in legal and political opposition to golf developments on their islands for fear the golf courses will destroy the nutrientpoor balance on which their coral reef and mangrove systems depend in saudi arabia and elsewhere in arid regions golf courses have been constructed on nothing more than oilcovered sand players may use a roller on the greens to smooth the intended path before putting a course in coober pedy australia consists of nine holes dug into mounds of sand diesel fuel and oil with no grass appearing anywhere on the course players carry a small piece of astroturf from which they tee the ball in new zealand it is not uncommon for rural
