who take life728 he noted that his greatgrandmother was raped by a sheriff29 and in the senate confirmation hearings concerning samuel alito said his grandmother was a product of that rapecitation needed coburn was one of the original authors of the federal partialbirth abortion ban act upheld by the supreme court in gonzales v carhart30 the act relied on an expansive view of the constitutions commerce clause as it applies to any physician who in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce knowingly performs a partialbirth abortion30 the acts reliance on such a broad reading of the commerce clause was criticized by independence institute scholar david kopel and university of tennessee law professor glenn reynolds who noted that unless a physician is operating a mobile abortion clinic on the metroliner it is not really possible to perform an abortion in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce31 when coburn later called supreme court nominee elena kagan ignorant due to her very expansive view of the commerce clause his support for the act was used by kagan supporters who charged him with hypocrisy on the issue30 on september 14 2005 during the confirmation hearings for supreme court nominee john g roberts coburn began his opening statement with a critique of beltway partisan politics while according to news reports choking back a sob32 coburn had earlier been

various legal terms mentioned during the previous days hearings proceeding to questions regarding both abortion and endoflife issues coburn who noted that during his tenure as an obstetrician he had delivered some 4000 babies asked roberts whether the judge agreed with the proposition that the opposite of being dead is being alive you know im going somewhere one of the problems i have is coming up with just the common sense and logic that if brain wave and heartbeat signifies life the absence of them signifies death then the presence of them certainly signifies life and to say it otherwise logically is schizophrenic and thats how i view a lot of the decisions that have come from the supreme court on the issue of abortion34 fiscal conservatismedit senators coburn and barack obama discuss
