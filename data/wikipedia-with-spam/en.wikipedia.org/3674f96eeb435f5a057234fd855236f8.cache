republican party presidential candidates 2016 donald trump presidential campaign 2016 and republican party presidential primaries 2016 in 2016 both the democratic and republican conventions were held before the summer olympics instead of after as was the case in 2008 and 2012 one reason the republican party scheduled their convention in july was to help avoid a longer drawnout primary battle similar to what happened in 2012 which left the party fractured heading into the general election and eventually led to mitt romney losing the election to barack obama the democratic party then followed suit scheduling their convention in philadelphia the week after the republicans convention to provide a quicker response10 on may 3 republican national committee chairman reince priebus declared donald trump the presumptive nominee after texas senator ted cruz dropped out of the race the next day ohio governor john kasich suspended his campaign effectively making trump the presumptive republican presidential nominee trump was the first presidential nominee of a major party since wendell willkie the republican candidate in 1940 who has held neither political office nor a high military rank prior to his nomination he was also the first presidential nominee of a major party without political experience since general dwight d eisenhower first captured the republican presidential nomination in 1952 this was the first republican national convention to be held entirely in july since 1980 twitter and cbs news live streamed the convention via twitter11 selectionedit on april 2 2014 the republican national committee announced that cincinnati cleveland dallas denver kansas city and las vegas were the finalists for hosting the convention12 in late june 2014 cleveland and dallas were announced as the final two contenders to be the host city13 cleveland was selected on july 8 201414 host committeeedit the 2016 cleveland host committee an ohio nonprofit corporation with no political affiliation is the official and federally designated presidential convention host committee for the convention it is responsible for organizing hosting and funding the convention it also aims to promote northeast ohio and ensure cleveland is best represented and to lessen the burden of local governments in hosting the 2016 republican national convention15 the host committee is composed of prominent ohio business executives civic leaders and other community leaders1617 david gilbert ceo of destination cleveland and the greater cleveland sports commission is the president and ceo of the host committee15 organizers have found it hard to raise the money needed to put on the convention which is normally supported by corporate donations corporations that donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the 2012 convention but nothing in 2016 include jpmorgan chase general electric ford motor company motorola solutions and amgen18 reluctance to be associated with trump or concern that the convention might be disrupted by floor fights or violence were sometimes cited as factors in the decision to withhold funds1920 in july as the convention got under way the cleveland host committee said it had raised 58 million of its 64 million goal they asked billionaire sheldon adelson who often contributes to republicans to make up the 6 million shortfall21 security arrangements and planningedit the convention is designated as a national special security event meaning that ultimate authority over law enforcement goes to the secret service and department of homeland security22 a highly publicized online petition23 by gun activists to allow the open carry of guns inside quicken loans arena garnered 45000 signatures however the secret service which is in charge of convention security announced that it would not allow guns in the arena or the small secure zone immediately outside it24 during the event25 releasing a statement in late march 2016 saying individuals determined to be carrying firearms will not be allowed past a predetermined outer perimeter checkpoint regardless of whether they possess a ticket to the event26 the secret service has the authority to restrict guns firearms or other weapons from entering any site where it is protecting an individual27 the cleveland police department received 50 million in federal grants to support local police operations during the event28 with this grant money the city of cleveland sought to purchase over 2000 riot control personnel gear sets prior to the convention for 20 million and the remaining 30 million is expected to go to personnel expenses29 items such as water guns swords tennis balls and coolers have been banned by the city of cleveland from the 17squaremile event zone outside the convention hall by the city of cleveland but because of a statewide opencarry law permitting the open carrying of guns firearms are permitted24303132 the cleveland chapter of the naacp raised concerns in march 2016 in a letter to city and county leaders about security at the convention writing that police were unprepared for a possible mix of protesters and demonstrators brandishing guns2333 the cleveland police union also raised concerns similar to those raised by the local naacp in march writing that equipment and training for police was behind schedule23 on july 16—the eve of the convention—the cleveland police union asked governor john kasich to temporarily suspend ohios state opencarry gun law so as to block the carrying of guns within the event zone24 but kasich rejected the request writing ohio governors do not have the power to arbitrarily suspend federal and state constitutional rights or state laws as suggested24 before the convention there were a number of online phishing expeditions that may have been hackers looking for weak spots in the conventions network34 the computer network of the democratic national committee had already been penetrated by hackers linked with the russian government compromising among other things the database of opposition research on trump35 on july 17 2016 the new york times reported that cleveland has assigned about 500 police officers specifically to handle the convention and it has brought in thousands more officers to help from departments as distant as california and texas36 protest planningedit the los angeles times wrote at the end of march 2016 that fears of a turbulent and volatile convention atmosphere were heightened because of a variety of factors a city scarred by controversial police shootings and simmering with racial tension a candidate trump who has threatened that his supporters will riot if he comes with the most delegates but leaves without the nomination and a police force with a reputation for brutality37 concerns specifically focused on the ability of the cleveland police department to handle protests in the wake of the tamir rice and michael brelo cases and a 2014 department of justice investigation that criticized the police department for having a pattern or practice of using unreasonable and unnecessary force37 leftwing activists have been preparing for the convention since it was announced in 201437 in may 2016 the american civil liberties union threatened to file a lawsuit on behalf of two activist groups citizens for trump and a progressive group called organize ohio asserting that protesters were being inhibited in their attempts to organize effectively by the citys delay in granting permits38 as of may 19 six groups had filed for permits but none had been granted cleveland stalled on approving and making public the demonstration applications it received while philadelphia hosting the 2016 democratic national convention had already granted an application39 the aclu sued the city in federal district court on june 14 201640 as of may 20 2016 groups that have filed for protest permits have included the aids healthcare foundation global zero organize ohio a group of progressive activists the citizens for trumpour votes matter march coalition to march on the rnc and dump trump stand together against trump an antidonald trump group peoples fightback centermarch against racism and created equal an antiabortion group a protrump group trump march rnc withdrew its application after trump became the presumptive nominee41 attendance

announced that they would skip the convention44 a number of republican governors us representatives and us senators particularly those facing difficult reelection campaigns also indicated that they would not attend seeking to distance themselves from trump and spend more time with voters in their home states42 most notably governor kasich chose to avoid the convention while ohio senator rob portman attended the convention but avoided taking a major role in its proceedings45 on july 8 2016 nebraska senator ben sasse announced that he would not attend the convention46 many republican senators did not attend the convention at all47 senator steve daines of montana who would be flyfishing with his wife senator jeff flake of arizona who said he had to mow his lawn and senator lisa murkowski of alaska who would be traveling in alaska by bush plane47 a number of prominent businesses and trade groups including cocacola microsoft and hewlettpackard scaled back participation in the convention sharply reducing their contributions for convention events and sponsorship4348 in june six major companies that sponsored the 2012 republican convention—wells fargo ups motorola jpmorgan chase ford and walgreens boots—announced they would not sponsor the 2016 republican convention49 apple inc followed suit announcing that it too would be withdrawing funding from the convention over trumps position on certain election issues50 seating assignmentsedit seating arrangements for state and territorial delegations were announced on july 16 two days before the convention began5152 the ohio and texas delegations were assigned to the back of the convention hall a move viewed as punishment for the delegations as they did not back trump in their respective primaries ohio and texas voted for kasich and cruz respectively5354 convention committees and meetings before the conventionedit there are four convention committees which met ahead of the convention for specific purposes under the rules of the republican party55 each committee is composed of one man and one woman from each state the five us territories and the district of columbia totaling 112 members those committee members are selected by the 56 delegations which determine on their own how to choose their representatives on each committee56 each of the committees met the week before the convention at the

washington dc members of this committee are elected at state conventions5859 the rules committee was chaired by enid mickelsen of utah and ron kaufman of massachusetts60 in june 2016 activists eric okeefe and dane waters formed a group called delegates unbound which cnn described as an effort to convince delegates that they have the authority and the ability to vote for whomever they want616256 republican delegate kendal unruh led an effort among other republican delegates to change the convention rules to include a conscience clause that would allow delegates bound to trump to vote against him even on the first ballot at the july convention63 following a marathon 15hour meeting on july 14 2016 the rules committee voted down by a vote of 84–21 a move to send a minority report to the floor allowing the unbinding of delegates thereby guaranteeing trumps nomination the committee then made the opposite move voting 87–12 to include rules language specifically stating that delegates were required to vote based on their states primary and caucus results64 by a unanimous vote the rules committee also voted to change rule 40b a controversial rule that had provided that a candidate had to win a majority of the vote in eight states to have his or her name placed into nomination at the convention65 the committee voted to return to the pre2012 rule which required a candidate to receive only a plurality of the vote in at least five states to have his or her name placed in nomination65 platform committeeedit the platform committee met for two days of open hearings on july 11 and 125766 to draft a party platform which had to be ratified by the full convention see platform below67 the platform committee was chaired by senator john barrasso of wyoming and cochaired by

views on social issues especially centering around homosexuality were adopted by the platform committee including but not limited to an opposition to obergefell v hodges the platform committee adopted its platform on july 1275 the platform was described as staunchly conservative and reflective of the partys move towards the right767778 the most contentious discussions at the platform committee dealt with social issues particularly those dealing with lgbt people7678 the platform adopted by the platform committee adopted a strict traditionalist view on social issues expressing deep criticism of how the modern american family has evolved76 many platform planks expressing disapproval of homosexuality samesex marriage or transgender rights—championed by tony perkins the president of the family research council—passed76 the platform calls for overturning obergefell v hodges the supreme court decision on samesex marriage by a constitutional amendment76 the platform also calls for the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values76 the platform promotes state bathroom bills to restrict the public restrooms that transgender persons can use and stated that natural marriage is between a man and a woman and is less likely to result in children who become drug addicts7876 the platform also expressed support for allowing parents to seek the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children which was widely seen as alluding to the right of parents to have their gay minors undergo conversion therapy767879808182 the platform calls internet pornography a public health crisis that is destroying the life of millions and encourages states to fight it83 the platform also calls for the teaching of the bible in public schools76 rachel hoff a district of columbia delegate who is the first openly gay member of a republican platform committee offered several amendments to soften or offer language inclusive of the lgbt community but each proposal failed84 hoffs proposal for language stating that marriage is a fundamentally important institution and that there are diverse and sincerely held views on marriage within the party failed in an unofficial vote of 30 to 8284 an amendment was also offered to recognize that gay people are targeted by isil the delegates who introduced this amendment sought to signal inclusion of the gay community the amendment was opposed by conservative delegates such as jim bopp of indiana who termed such an amendment identity politics and was voted down7678 the partys platform language was strengthened to condemn all types of abortion without exceptions78 the platform committee adopted a provision proposed by kansas secretary of state kris kobach expressing opposition to any restriction on magazine capacity in firearms7678 the platform called for certain federally controlled public lands to be immediately transferred to state ownership where it could be privatized the platform did not specify whether the lands would include national parks national forests or wilderness areas85 on foreign policy the members of the platform committee were split between libertarianminded isolationists and national security hawks78 the latter camp won on almost every point voting down measures that would have condemned ongoing us involvement in middle eastern wars and approving language promoting increased military spending78 one plank reflected a more isolationist approach eliminating references to giving weapons to ukraine in its fight with russia and rebel forces after trump staffers reportedly intervened with delegates86 the platform adopted by the platform committee opposes a twostate solution to the israeli–palestinian conflict78 while the 2012 republican platform called for passage of the transpacific partnership tpp the 2016 platform adopted by the convention committee omits mention of the agreement reflecting the influence of presumptive nominee donald trump who opposes the trade pact76 the platform also expressly calls for a wall to be built on the usmexico border as trump has called for a strengthening of initially proposed language calling for a physical barrier76 adoption of platform by conventionedit giovanni cicione of rhode island a platform committee member led a dissident group of republican delegates who opposed the antilgbt provisions of the sixtypage committeeadopted platform and sought to replace it with a twopage statement of principles that avoided controversial issues such as samesex marriage7587 cicione tried to force a debate and vote on the platform from the floor of the convention7587 ciciones effort was unsuccessful on the first day of the convention the delegates approved the platform by voice vote with only a few scattered nays audible88 the conventionedit floor fight over rulesedit after the indiana primary on may 3 2016 donald trump became the presumptive nominee as the lone remaining republican candidate running for the republican nomination under rules established by previous republican conventions most delegates were bound on the first ballot according to the results of the primaries8990 a simple majority of 1237 delegates was needed to win the nomination9192 entering the convention trump was seen as the presumptive nominee and had the support of a comfortable majority of the delegates93 presidential nomination delegate count prior to convention candidate pledged delegates on first ballot94 delegate soft count95 donald trump 1441 1537 ted cruz 551 569 marco rubio 173 166 john kasich 161 164 ben carson 9 7 jeb bush 4 4 other candidates 3 3 uncommitted delegates 13096 19 available delegates 0 3 on the afternoon of july 18 2016 a group of delegates sought to force a rollcall vote on the proposed convention rules package adopted by the rules committee9397 some who demanded a roll call vote sought to change the party rules package to unbind delegates so that on the first ballot delegates could vote their conscience and conceivably block trump from being nominated on the first ballot such a move would also allow trump opponents a platform to argue against trump93 others demanding a roll call vote were seeking to reform party rules to decentralize power from the rnc and make changes for the 2020 primary process9398 that morning a petition for a roll call vote was submitted with the signatures of a majority of delegates from ten states99 that afternoon the presiding officer rep steve womack of arkansas did not recognize delegates clamoring for recognition over the rules package for the convention womack first declared the previous question was ordered by unanimous consent despite loud cries of objection the rules were then adopted by voice vote prompting loud cries of protest from delegates demanding recognition for a rollcall vote9399 finally womack declared that a reconsideration of a motion was laid upon the table by unanimous consent again to cries of objection with loud cries throughout the convention hall womack abandoned the podium for several minutes allowing rnc and trump whips to work the floor and collect withdrawal signatures from the petition for a roll call vote100 womack then reappeared and again using unanimous consent stated he would put the question of adopting the rules to the convention for a voice vote a second time a second voice vote was taken womack then recognized the leader of the utah delegation who requested a roll call vote womack denied the motion ruling that there were insufficient signatures to compel such a vote93 and announcing that while there had initially appeared to be nine state delegations that agreed to the rollcall vote enough signatures had since been withdrawn to cause three states to fall below the threshold thus missing the required seven states needed101 it was reported that trump campaign aides and rnc staff worked on the floor to persuade delegates to withdraw their support and challenged the validity of various signatures9397 delegates including senator mike lee of utah sought recognition and repeatedly called for a point of order102 but were ignored by womack and reportedly had their microphones turned off103 lee said he had never seen anything like this after womack declined to recognize their objections and walked off the stage102 and ken cuccinelli the virginia delegation chairman said the rnc cheated and violated their own rules103 the process prompted the colorado delegation to walk out in protest93 nominations and ballotingedit further information results of the republican party presidential primaries 2016 and republican party vice presidential candidate selection 2016 jeff sessions us senator from alabama formally nominated trump for president104 with chris collins us representative from new york and henry mcmaster lieutenant governor of south carolina seconding the nomination105106 trump won the presidential nomination on july 19 2016107 on the first ballot with 698 of the delegates the lowest percentage of delegates won by the republican nominee since the 1976 republican national convention108 the vice presidential nomination was held immediately after the presidential nomination eric holcomb the lieutenant governor of indiana nominated indiana governor mike pence for vice president109 trump had announced his choice of pence as his preferred running mate the weekend before the start of the convention110 pence won the vice presidential nomination by acclamation111 all of the delegates from iowa alaska utah and the district of columbia were recorded and counted for trump despite the fact that trump lost all three contests and most of the members of those delegations had voted for other candidates the alaska delegation challenged the award of votes to trump by the rnc secretary and the utah delegation booed when its delegates were awarded to trump but was reminded by the rnc chairman that the rules for these two states required the votes to be awarded to whichever candidate was still in the race for the rnc nomination for president and that cruz rubio and the other candidates that had withdrawn from the race had forfeited these delegates based on the rnc nomination rules112113114115116 republican presidential nomination ballot candidates donald trump ted cruz marco rubio john kasich ben

speakersedit planning and invitationsedit in april 2016 trump vowed to bring some showbiz to the convention criticizing the partys 2012 convention in tampa florida as the single most boring convention i’ve ever seen118 the conventions lineup of speakers lacked many of the partys rising stars and rather featured some of trumps eclectic collection of friends celebrities and relatives119 politico reported that trump was directly involved in details of convention plans seeking to maximize the drama and spectacle of the fournight event120 a large number of prominent republican elected officials said they were not interested in attending the convention or even speaking at it seeking to distance themselves from trump121 the trump campaign considered the idea of having trump speak all four nights at the convention – a break from the traditional practice of the presidential nominee taking the stage only on the final night of the convention120 ultimately trump decided not to speak every night122 trump also initially stated that he would announce his vicepresidential running mate at the convention itself rather than before the convention123 with a campaign staffer saying that announcing the vicepresidential nominee before the convention is like announcing the winner of celebrity apprentice before the final episode is on the air120 trumps campaign eventually announced plans to announce a running mate the week before the convention124 and named mike pence as his running mate on july 15 2016125 a number of figures that trump said he would invite to speak including boxing promoter don king former alaska governor sarah palin and new england patriots quarterback tom brady were not included in the lineup119 trump wanted king to speak at the convention and raised the issue several times reportedly until republican national committee chairman reince priebus firmly explained to trump that king should not be invited due to his past manslaughter conviction126 former chicago bears coach mike ditka a trump supporter declined an invitation to speak127 an early roster of speakers obtained by the media listed former nfl quarterback tim tebow as a speaker but tebow later dismissed this as a rumor and did not appear at the convention128129 haskel lookstein a prominent orthodox rabbi was initially set to appear at the convention to deliver the opening prayer having accepted an invitation to do so from ivanka trump a congregant but after hundreds of american modern orthodox jews urged him to withdraw from the convention lookstein pulled out130 trump sought to bar those who have not endorsed him from addressing the convention making comments aimed at the former primary rivals who have declined to endorse him – bush carly fiorina lindsey graham and george pataki131 however both senator marco rubio of florida and senator ted cruz of texas who ran against trump for the republican nomination and lost were eventually placed on the speakers schedule although neither paid the expected price of that spotlight by offering an explicit endorsement132 cruz met with trump two weeks before the convention and accepted an invitation to speak132 rubio was initially not offered a speaking slot and was expected to skip the convention133 but on july 17 2016 it was confirmed that rubio would address the convention via recorded video132 neither rubio nor cruz were listed as headliner speakers132 governor kasich did not enter the convention hall or speak at the convention despite overtures from trump allies priebus and newt gingrich – who along with chris christie lost the running mate job to pence – and top trump campaign advisor paul manafort133 kasich said if im going to show up at the convention and im not going to be saying all these great things about the host then i think its inappropriate i dont think thats the right thing to do kasich attended events outside the convention hall in support of downballot republican candidates133 as the convention began the trump campaign lashed out at kasich for his failure to endorse prompting an exchange that the new york times called remarkably bitter and the latest extraordinary turn in a campaign that has veered sharply away from political precedent134 manafort called kasich petulant and accused him of embarrassing his party prompting kasich chief political aide john weaver to mock

attention melania trumps speech and plagiarism controversyedit “from a young age my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise that you treat people with respect150” — melania trump at the 2016 republican national convention external video melania trump remarks at republican national convention july 18 2016 cspan151 external image comparing melania trumps speech in 2016 with michelle obamas in 2008 the washington post july 19 2016 some portions of the two speeches were very similar and other parts were nearly identical152 play media comparing melania trumps speech in 2016 with michelle obamas in 2008 melania trumps speech153 almost immediately came under scrutiny when striking similarities were discovered between her speech and michelle obamas speech at the 2008 democratic national convention154 the trump campaign at first denied allegations of plagiarism155156 campaign manager paul manafort argued that the speech contained not that many similarities and the words used are not unique words that belong to the obamas157 following mrs trumps speech various media outlets reported similarities as alleged plagiarism158159 chris harrick vice president of marketing at the plagiarism prevention service turnitin discovered that trump used about 6 of michelle obamas words and found two types of plagiarism clone and find and replace160161 various media outlets suggested that members of donald trumps presidential campaign should respond to the accusations which they did a few hours after the speech in the form of the following statement by the campaigns senior communications advisor jason miller in writing the speech melanias team of writers took notes on her lifes inspirations and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking melanias immigrant experience and love for america shone through in her speech which made it a success162 reince priebus chairman of the republican national committee described the speech as inspirational but said if plagiarism were found he thought it certainly seems reasonable to fire the person who wrote the speech163 paul manafort donald trumps campaign chairman called it a great speech and said obviously michelle obama feels very similar sentiments toward her family he later said to think that she would be cribbing michelle obama’s words is crazy adding this is once again an example of when a woman threatens hillary clinton she seeks out to demean her and take her down its not going to work against melania trump164 sean spicer director of communications for the republican national committee defended the speech by saying that similar statements have existed before her speech such as quotes by john legend kid rock and twilight sparkle from my little pony friendship is magic165 david lauter of the los angeles times stated that while these allegations are unlikely to cost trump votes the distraction is unhelpful referring to it as a lost opportunity for the campaign166 on july 20 2016 the trump campaign issued a statement by meredith mciver which included the following in working with melania on her recent first lady speech we discussed many people who inspired her and messages she wanted to share with the american people a person she has always liked is michelle obama over the phone she read me some passages from mrs obama’s speech as examples i wrote them down and later included some of the phrasing in the draft that ultimately became the final speech167168 on july 20 two days after melanias speech mciver wrote that donald trump declined her offer to resign169 chris christies speechedit in the second night of the convention governor chris christie gave a speech in a style of a mock trial after a series of accusations against hillary clinton to which his audience responded guilty the crowd chanted lock her up the crowds reaction has received widespread coverage following the speech170171143 the lock her up chant was later uttered by supporters of bernie sanders before the 2016 democratic national convention172 clinton responded to the chant in an interview on 60 minutes by saying that it saddened her173 ted cruzs speechedit “if you love our country and love our children as much as you do stand and speak and vote your conscience vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution174 — ted cruz at the 2016 republican national convention in the third night of the convention senator ted cruz of texas gave a speech in which he did not endorse trump for president and instead urged listeners to vote your conscience vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution175 protrump delegates were enraged at cruzs speech shouting him down and booing him off the stage176 in what was described by the new york times as the most electric moment of the convention175 convention security personnel and cruz advisor ken cuccinelli escorted cruzs wife heidi out of the hall fearing for her safety175176 newt gingrich spoke after cruz and said i had the text of what ted cruz was gonna say and i thought it was funny gingrich said i mean ted gets up and he says look vote your conscience for someone who will support the constitution well in this particular election year that by definition cannot be for hillary clinton177 the following morning cruz attended a contentious meeting with delegates representing texas that resulted in what cnn labeled a remarkable 25minute backandforth with his own constituents defying appeals from his own texas delegation to put the party above his inhibitions and back trump178179 cruzs speech sparked a backlash180181182183 and elicited negative reactions from prominent republicans supporting trump184 new jersey governor and former presidential candidate chris christie called the speech awful and selfish184 new york congressman peter t king called cruz a fraud and a selfcentered liar184 senator dan coats of indiana responded that cruz was a selfcentered narcissistic pathological liar185 representative marsha blackburn of tennessee when asked about cruzs speech responded that she would tell cruz the same thing i would tell my kids ‘get over yourself’186187 susan hutchison chair of the washington state republican party confronted cruz after his speech and labeled cruz a traitor to the party188 in addition cruz was denied entry to influential republican donor sheldon adelsons suite at the convention189 conservative radio host rush limbaugh speculated that cruz was trying to mimic ronald reagans speech at the 1976 republican national convention in that he wanted to deliver a speech that was reaganesque in that the delegates would walk out of there thinking that they should have nominated him he didnt get there instead limbaugh compared his speech to ted kennedys at the 1980 democratic national convention in which he failed to endorse president jimmy carter the nominee by putting his own interests ahead of the interests of the party190 according to cnn in the wake of cruz’s nonendorsement of trump at the rnc his critics believe that an intraparty challenge could be possible gop donors and texas politicians have asked rep mike mccaul to run against him in the next cycle’s texas primary in 2018 mccaul a congressman for six terms and chair of the house homeland security committee has not yet made a decision but likewise has not yet ruled out a possible senate run191 later on september 23 2016 cruz publicly endorsed trump for president192 peter thiels speechedit instead of going to mars we invaded the middle east … its time to end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country when i was a kid the great debate was about how to defeat the soviet union and we won now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom this is a distraction from our real problems who cares193 peter thiel at the 2016 republican national convention peter thiel a billionaire paypal cofounder and silicon valley investor delivered a manifesto for tackling the greater issues of the day focusing on technology the economy and small government194 thiel also affirmed his pride to be gay a republican and most of all an american a stance that earned him a standing ovation chanting usa195 it was the first time in the history of republican national conventions that a speaker identified himself as gay in his speech although there have been previous speeches by gay men196 donald trumps speechedit play media donald trump making his acceptance speech for the rnc voa trump having been formally nominated as the republican presidential nominee on the second night of the convention spoke on the fourth and final night of the convention trumps speech was leaked hours in advance by correct the record a liberalleaning super pac though trump had already given copies of his speech to the network press pool197 trumps daughter ivanka trump introduced trump in a speech immediately before his own speech198 here comes the sun was used as the entrance music for ivanka trump the george harrison estate complained about the use of this song which his family said was offensive and against the wishes of the george harrison estate199 trump spoke for 75 minutes making his speech the longest since at least the 1972 republican national convention and one of the longest acceptance speeches ever in majorparty convention history200 in his speech trump stated that america faces a crisis due to attacks on our police and terrorism in our cities and emphasized an important theme in his campaign law and order200 in evaluating the speech glenn thrush of politico noted the influence of richard nixon spiro agnew ronald reagan and rudy giuliani all of whom sounded similar themes earlier in american history in attempts to win over the silent majority201 trump also promised to limit american participation in global crises and trade deals200 when trump turned to the subject of illegal immigration many in the audience began shouting build the wall build the wall” referring to a signature promise of trumps campaign to build a wall on the mexico–united states border200 trump also repeatedly attacked president barack obama and the democratic presumptive nominee hillary clinton arguing that the country and world had become less safe during their time in office200 however trump attempted to reach out to supporters of defeated democratic candidate bernie sanders as well as downandout urbanites202 in his speech trump also became the first republican nominee to mention the lgbt community in a gop nomination address saying as your president i will do everything in my power to protect our lgbtq citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology203 receptionedit trump making a speech on the final day of the rnc july 2016 philip rucker and david fahrenthold of the washington post found trumps speech to be relentlessly gloomy and observed that trump painted himself as an agent of change while he cast clinton as a defender of the status quo204 trumps speech was variously dubbed the mourning in america speech205 and the evening in america speech206 in reference to ronald reagans more optimistic morning in america campaign ad niall stanage of the hill argued that trumps speech brought stability to a turbulent convention and showed trump at his most comfortable and energized207 a politico poll found largely positive reactions among gop political insiders while democrats argued that trumps dark speech would prove damaging208 the new york post released a cover story the next day by michael goodwin praising trumps speech declaring it the speech of his life and also saying that the speech could signal the start of an american revival209 ratings figures released by the major networks showed that approximately 32 million viewers watched trumps speech slightly ahead of the number that watched mitt romneys 2012 speech210 some lgbt advocates critiqued trumps reference to lgbt people on the ground that it stood in contrast to positions he had taken on lgbt issues during the campaign activists such as chad griffin of the human rights campaign and rick zbur of equality california suggested that the statement was an attempt to turn lgbt people against muslims and pit minority groups against each other211212 pollingedit a gallup survey found that 35 of americans saw trumps speech positively either excellent or good while 36 saw it negatively213214 according to gallup the speech had the least positive reviews of any speech we have tested after the fact213 36 of americans said the convention made them more likely to vote for trump while 51 said it made them less likely to vote for him this is the highest less likely to vote percentage for a candidate in the 15 times gallup has asked this question after a convention213 it is also the first time in gallups convention polling that a democratic or republican convention has made more say that they are less likely to vote for the partys nominee215 according to a cnnorc poll the public rendered a split decision on whether the convention made them more or less likely to back trump with 42 saying more likely while 44 saying less so216 40 called the speech excellent or good and about half of voters 45 said trumps speech reflected the way they feel about things in the us today216 however some negative numbers included the fact that 18 called trumps speech terrible which was the highest number recorded in that category by cnn since it first started to ask the question in 1996216 according to fivethirtyeight poll averages suggested a postconvention bounce of 3 to 4 percentage points for trump217 demonstrationsedit the number of demonstrators was significantly lower than expected and according to cleveland records three of five officially permitted protests planned for the first three days of the convention did not occur lowerthanexpected was attributed to a variety of factors including fear of violence from the police and fear of violence from the trump supporters clevelands relatively small size compared to cities such as chicago or new york and a heavy police presence218 on july 18 the conventions first day dueling antitrump and protrump demonstrations took place at various places in cleveland
