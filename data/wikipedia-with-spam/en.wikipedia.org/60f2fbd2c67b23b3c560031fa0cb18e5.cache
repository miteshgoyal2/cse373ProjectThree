3d film from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about motion pictures that enhance the illusion of depth perception for motion pictures created using 3d modeling software see computergenerated imagery a threedimensional stereoscopic film also known as threedimensional film 3d film or s3d film1 is a motion picture that enhances the illusion of depth perception hence adding a third dimension the most common approach to the production of 3d films is derived from stereoscopic photography in it a regular motion picture camera system is used to record the images as seen from two perspectives or computergenerated imagery generates the two perspectives in postproduction and special projection hardware andor eyewear are used to limit the visibility of each image in the pair to the viewers left or right eye only 3d films are not limited to theatrical releases television broadcasts and directtovideo films have also incorporated similar methods especially since the advent of 3d television and bluray 3d 3d films have existed in some form since 1915 but had been largely relegated to a niche in the motion picture industry because of the costly hardware and processes required to produce and display a 3d film and the lack of a standardized format for all segments of the entertainment business nonetheless 3d films were prominently featured in the 1950s in american cinema and later experienced a worldwide resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s driven by imax highend theaters and disney themedvenues 3d films became more and more successful throughout the

and when to remove this template message early patents and testsedit the stereoscopic era of motion pictures began in the late 1890s when british film pioneer william friesegreene filed a patent for a 3d film process in his patent two films were projected side by side on screen the viewer looked through a stereoscope to converge the two images because of the obtrusive mechanics behind this method theatrical use was not practical2 frederic eugene ives patented his stereo camera rig in 1900 the camera had two lenses coupled together 1¾ inches 445 centimeters apart3 on june 10 1915 edwin s porter and william e waddell presented tests to an audience at the astor theater in new york city4 in redgreen anaglyph the audience was presented three reels of tests which included rural scenes test shots of marie doro a segment of john mason playing a number of passages from jim the penman a film released by famous playerslasky that year but not in 3d oriental dancers and a reel of footage of niagara falls5 however according to adolph zukor in his 1953 autobiography the public is never wrong my 50 years in the motion picture industry nothing was produced in this process after these tests early systems of stereoscopic filmmaking pre1952edit fairall in 1922 fairalls 3d camera audience wearing special glasses watch a 3d stereoscopic film at the telekinema on the south bank in london during the festival of britain 1951 the earliest confirmed 3d film shown to an outofhouse audience was the power of love which premiered at the ambassador hotel theater in los angeles on 27 september 1922678 the camera rig was a product of the films producer harry k fairall and cinematographer robert f elder2 it was projected dualstrip in the redgreen anaglyph format making it both the earliest known film that utilized dual strip projection and the earliest known film in which anaglyph glasses were used9 whether fairall used colored filters on the projection ports or whether he used tinted prints is unknown after a preview for exhibitors and press in new york city the film dropped out of sight apparently not booked by exhibitors and is now considered lost early in december 1922 william van doren kelley inventor of the prizma color system cashed in on the growing interest in 3d films started by fairalls demonstration and shot footage with a camera system of his own design kelley then struck a deal with samuel roxy rothafel to premiere the first in his series of plasticon shorts entitled movies of the future at the rivoli theater in new york city also in december 1922 laurens hammond later inventor of the hammond organ premiered his teleview system which had been shown to the trade and press in october teleview was the first alternatingframe 3d system seen by the public using lefteye and righteye prints and two interlocked projectors left and right frames were alternately projected each pair being shown three times to suppress flicker viewing devices attached to the armrests of the theater seats had rotary shutters that operated synchronously with the projector shutters producing a clean and clear stereoscopic result the only theater known to have installed teleview was the selwyn theater in new york city and only one show was ever presented with it a group of short films an exhibition of live 3d shadows and mars the only teleview feature the show ran for several weeks apparently doing good business as a novelty mars itself got poor reviews but teleview was never seen again10 in 1922 frederic eugene ives and jacob leventhal began releasing their first stereoscopic shorts made over a threeyear period the first film entitled plastigrams was distributed nationally by educational pictures in the redandblue anaglyph format ives and leventhal then went on to produce the following stereoscopic shorts in the stereoscopiks series released by pathé films in 1925 zowie april 10 lunacy may 18 the runaway taxi december 17 and ouch december 1711 on 22 september 1924 lunacy was rereleased in the deforest phonofilm soundonfilm system12 the late 1920s to early 1930s saw little interest in stereoscopic pictures in paris louis lumiere shot footage with his stereoscopic camera in september 1933 the following march he exhibited a remake of his 1895 short film larrivée du train this time in anaglyphic 3d at a meeting of the french academy of science13 in 1936 leventhal and john norling were hired based on their test footage to film mgms audioscopiks series the prints were by technicolor in the redandgreen anaglyph format and were narrated by pete smith the first film audioscopiks premiered january 11 1936 and the new audioscopiks premiered january 15 1938 audioscopiks was nominated for the academy award in the category best short subject novelty in 1936 with the success of the two audioscopiks films mgm produced one more short in anaglyph 3d another pete smith specialty called third dimensional murder 1941 unlike its predecessors this short was shot with a studiobuilt camera rig prints were by technicolor in redandblue anaglyph the short is notable for being one of the few liveaction appearances of the frankenstein monster as conceived by jack pierce for universal studios outside of their company while many of these films were printed by color systems none of them was actually in color and the use of the color printing was only to achieve an anaglyph effect14 introduction of polaroidedit while attending harvard university edwin h land conceived the idea of reducing glare by polarizing light he took a leave of absence from harvard to set up a lab and by 1929 had invented and patented a polarizing sheet15 in 1932 he introduced polaroid j sheet as a commercial product16 while his original intention was to create a filter for reducing glare from car headlights land did not underestimate the utility of his newly dubbed polaroid filters in stereoscopic presentations in january 1936 land gave the first demonstration of polaroid filters in conjunction with 3d photography at the waldorfastoria hotel17citation needed the reaction was enthusiastic and he followed it up with an installation at the new york museum of sciencecitation needed it is unknown what film was run for audiences at this exhibition using polaroid filters meant an entirely new form of projection however two prints each carrying either the right or left eye view had to be synced up in projection using an external selsyn motor furthermore polarized light would be largely depolarized by a matte white screen and only a silver screen or screen made of other reflective material would correctly reflect the separate images later that year the feature nozze vagabonde appeared in italy followed in germany by zum greifen nah you can nearly touch it and again in 1939 with germanys sechs mädel rollen ins wochenend six girls drive into the weekend the italian film was made with the gualtierotti camera the two german productions with the zeiss camera and the vierling shooting system all of these films were the first exhibited using polaroid filters the zeiss company in germany manufactured glasses on a commercial basis commencing in 1936 they were also independently made around the same time in germany by e käsemann and by j mahler18 in 1939 john norling shot in tune with tomorrow the first commercial 3d film using polaroid in the uscitation needed this short premiered at the 1939 new york worlds fair and was created specifically for the chrysler motors pavilion in it a full 1939 chrysler plymouth is magically put together set to music originally in black and white the film was so popular that it was reshot in color for the following year at the fair under the title new dimensionscitation needed in 1953 it was reissued by rko as motor rhythm another early short that utilized the polaroid 3d process was 1940s magic movies thrills for you produced by the pennsylvania railroad co for the golden gate international expositioncitation needed produced by john norling it was filmed by jacob leventhal using his own rig it consisted of shots of various views that could be seen from the pennsylvania railroads trains in the 1940s world war ii prioritized military applications of stereoscopic photography and it once again went on the back burner in most producers minds the golden era 1952–1954edit what aficionados consider the golden era of 3d began in late 1952 with the release of the first color stereoscopic feature bwana devil produced written and directed by arch oboler the film was shot in natural vision a process that was cocreated and controlled by m l gunzberg gunzberg who built the rig with his brother julian and two other associates shopped it without success to various studios before oboler used it for this feature which went into production with the title the lions of gulu19 the film starred robert stack barbara britton and nigel bruce as with practically all of the features made during this boom bwana devil was projected dualstrip with polaroid filters during the 1950s the familiar disposable anaglyph glasses made of cardboard were mainly used for comic books two shorts by exploitation specialist dan sonney and three shorts produced by lippert productions however even the lippert shorts were available in the dualstrip format alternatively because the features utilized two projectors a capacity limit of film being loaded onto each projector about 6000 feet 1800 m or an hours worth of film meant that an intermission was necessary for every featurelength film quite often intermission points were written into the script at a major plot point during christmas of 1952 producer sol lesser quickly premiered the dualstrip showcase called stereo techniques in chicago20 lesser acquired the rights to five dualstrip shorts two of them now is the time to put on your glasses and around is around were directed by norman mclaren in 1951 for the national film board of canada the other three films were produced in britain for festival of britain in 1951 by raymond spottiswoode these were a solid explanation royal river and the black swan james mage was also an early pioneer in the 3d craze using his 16 mm 3d bolex system he premiered his triorama program on february 10 1953 with his four shorts sunday in stereo indian summer american life and this is bolex stereo21 this show is considered lost another early 3d film during the boom was the lippert productions short a day in the country narrated by joe besser and composed mostly of test footage unlike all of the other lippert shorts which were available in both dualstrip and anaglyph this production was released in anaglyph only april 1953 saw two groundbreaking features in 3d columbias man in the dark and warner bros house of wax the first 3d feature with stereophonic sound house of wax outside of cinerama was the first time many american audiences heard recorded stereophonic sound it was also the film that typecast vincent price as a horror star as well as the king of 3d after he became the actor to star in the most 3d features the others were the mad magician dangerous mission and son of sinbad the success of these two films proved that major studios now had a method of getting filmgoers back into theaters and away from television sets which were causing a steady decline in attendance the walt disney studios waded into 3d with its may 28 1953 release of melody which accompanied the first 3d western columbias fort ti at its los angeles opening it was later shown at disneylands fantasyland theater in 1957 as part of a program with disneys other short working for peanuts entitled 3d jamboree the show was hosted by the mousketeers and was in color universalinternational released their first 3d feature on may 27 1953 it came from outer space with stereophonic sound following that was paramounts first feature sangaree with fernando lamas and arlene dahl columbia released several 3d westerns produced by sam katzman and directed by william castle castle would later specialize in various technical intheater gimmicks for such columbia and allied artists features as 13 ghosts house on haunted hill and the tingler columbia also produced the only slapstick comedies conceived for 3d the three stooges starred in spooks and pardon my backfire dialect comic harry mimmo starred in down the hatch producer jules white was optimistic about the possibilities of 3d as applied to slapstick with pies and other projectiles aimed at the audience but only two of his stereoscopic shorts were shown in 3d down the hatch was released as a conventional flat motion picture columbia has since printed down the hatch in 3d for film festivals john ireland joanne dru and macdonald carey starred in the jack broder color production hannah lee which premiered june 19 1953 the film was directed by ireland who sued broder for his salary broder countersued claiming that ireland went over production costs with the filmcitation needed another famous entry in the golden era of 3d was the 3 dimensional pictures production of robot monster the film was allegedly scribed in an hour by screenwriter wyott ordung and filmed in a period of two weeks on a shoestring budgetcitation needed despite these shortcomings and the fact that the crew had no previous experience with the newly built camera rig luck was on the cinematographers side as many find the 3d photography in the film is well shot and aligned robot monster also has a notable score by then upandcoming composer elmer bernstein the film was released june 24 1953 and went out with the short stardust in your eyes which starred nightclub comedian slick slavincitation needed 20th century fox produced their only 3d feature inferno in 1953 starring rhonda fleming fleming who also starred in those redheads from seattle and jivaro shares the spot for being the actress to appear in the most 3d features with patricia medina who starred in sangaree phantom of the rue morgue and drums of tahiti darryl f zanuck expressed little interest in stereoscopic systems and at that point was preparing to premiere the new widescreen film system cinemascope the first decline in the theatrical 3d craze started in august and september 1953 the factors causing this decline were two prints had to be projected simultaneously the prints had to remain exactly alike after repair or synchronization would be lost it sometimes required two projectionists to keep sync working properly when either prints or shutters became out of sync even for a single frame the picture became virtually unwatchable and accounted for headaches and eyestrain the necessary silver projection screen was very directional and caused sideline seating to be unusable with both 3d and regular films due to the angular darkening of these screens later films that opened in widerseated venues often premiered flat for that reason such as kiss me kate at the radio city music hall the few cartoons made in 3d had a cardboard cutout effect where flat objects appeared on different planes a mandatory intermission was needed to properly prepare the theaters projectors for the showing of the second half of the film because projection booth operators were at many times careless even at preview screenings of 3d films trade and newspaper critics claimed that certain films were hard on the eyescitation needed sol lesser attempted to follow up stereo techniques with a new showcase this time five shorts that he himself producedcitation needed the project was to be called the 3d follies and was to be distributed by rkocitation needed unfortunately because of financial difficulties and the general loss of interest in 3d lesser canceled the project during the summer of 1953 making it the first 3d film to be aborted in productioncitation needed two of the three shorts were shot carmenesque a burlesque number starring exotic dancer lili st cyr and fun in the sun a sports short directed by famed set designerdirector william cameron menzies who also directed the 3d feature the maze for allied artists although it was more expensive to install the major competing realism process was anamorphic first utilized by fox with cinemascope and its september premiere in the robe anamorphic features needed only a single print so synchronization was not an issue cinerama was also a competitor from the start and had better quality control than 3d because it was owned by one company that focused on quality control however most of the 3d features past the summer of 1953 were released in the flat widescreen formats ranging from 1661 to 1851 in early studio advertisements and articles about widescreen and 3d formats widescreen systems were referred to as 3d causing some confusion among scholars there was no single instance of combining cinemascope with 3d until 1960 with a film called september storm and even then that was a blowup from a nonanamorphic negativecitation needed september storm also went out with the last dualstrip short space attack which was actually shot in 1954 under the title the adventures of sam space in december 1953 3d made a comeback with the release of several important 3d films including mgms musical kiss me kate kate was the hill over which 3d had to pass to survive mgm tested it in six theaters three in 3d and three flatcitation needed according to trade ads of the time the 3d version was so wellreceived that the film quickly went into a wide stereoscopic releasecitation needed however most publications including kenneth macgowans classic film reference book behind the screen state that the film did much better as a regular release the film adapted from the popular cole porter broadway musical starred the mgm songbird team of howard keel and kathryn grayson as the leads supported by ann miller keenan wynn bobby van james whitmore kurt kasznar and tommy rall the film also prominently promoted its use of stereophonic sound several other features that helped put 3d back on the map that month were the john wayne feature hondo distributed by warner bros columbias miss sadie thompson with rita hayworth and paramounts money from home with dean martin and jerry lewis paramount also released the cartoon shorts boo moon with casper the friendly ghost and popeye ace of space with popeye the sailor paramount pictures released a 3d korean war film cease fire filmed on actual korean locations in 195322 top banana based on the popular stage musical with phil silvers was brought to the screen with the original cast although it was merely a filmed stage production the idea was that every audience member would feel they would have the best seat in the house through color photography and 3dcitation needed although the film was shot and edited in 3d united artists the distributor felt the production was uneconomical in stereoscopic form and released the film flat on january 27 1954citation needed it remains one of two golden era 3d features along with another united artists feature southwest passage with john ireland and joanne dru that are currently considered lost although flat versions survive a string of successful films filmed in 3d followed the second wave but many were widely or exclusively shown flat some highlights are the french line starring jane russell and gilbert roland a howard hughesrko production the film became notorious for being released without an mpaa seal of approval after several suggestive lyrics were included as well as one of ms russells particularly revealing costumescitation needed playing up her sex appeal one tagline for the film was itll knock both of your eyes out the film was later cut and approved by the mpaa for a general flat release despite having a wide and profitable 3d releasecitation needed taza son of cochise a sequel to 1950s broken arrow which starred rock hudson in the title role barbara rush as the love interest and rex reason billed as bart roberts as his renegade brother originally released flat through universalinternational it was directed by the great stylist douglas sirk and his striking visual sense made the film a huge success when it was repremiered in 3d in 2006 at the second 3d expo in hollywood two ape films phantom of the rue morgue featuring karl malden and patricia medina produced by warner bros and based on edgar allan poes the murders in the rue morgue and gorilla at large a panoramic production starring cameron mitchell distributed flat and 3d through fox creature from the black lagoon starring richard carlson and julie adams directed by jack arnold although arguably the most famous 3d film it was typically seen in 3d only in large urban theaters and shown flat in the many smaller neighborhood theaters23 it was the only 3d feature that spawned a 3d sequel revenge of the creature which was in turn followed by the creature walks among us shot flat dial m for murder directed by alfred hitchcock and starring ray milland robert cummings and grace kelly is considered by aficionados of 3d to be one of the best examples of the process although available in 3d in 1954 there are no known playdates in 3d since warner bros had just instated a simultaneous 3d2d release policy the films screening in 3d in february 1980 at the york theater in san francisco did so well that warner bros rereleased the film in 3d in february 1982 the film is now available on 3d bluray marking the first time it was released on home video in its 3d presentation gog the last episode in ivan tors office of scientific investigation osi trilogy dealing with realistic science fiction following the magnetic monster and riders to the stars most theaters showed it flat the diamond released in the united states as the diamond wizard a 1954 british crime film starring dennis okeefe the only stereoscopic feature shot in britain released flat in both the uk and us irwin allens dangerous mission released by rko in 1954 featuring allens trademarks of an allstar cast facing a disaster a forest fire bosley crowthers new york times review mentions that it was shown flat son of sinbad another rkohoward hughes production starring dale robertson lili st cyr and vincent price the film was shelved after hughes ran into difficulty with the french line and wasnt released until 1955 at which time it went out flat converted to the superscope process 3ds final decline was in the late spring of 1954 for the same reasons as the previous lull as well as the further success of widescreen formats with theater operators even though polaroid had created a welldesigned telltale filter kit for the purpose of recognizing and adjusting out of sync and phase 3dcitation needed exhibitors still felt uncomfortable with the system and turned their focus instead to processes such as cinemascope the last 3d feature to be released in that format during the golden era was revenge of the creature on february 23 1955 ironically the film had a wide release in 3d and was well received at the box office24 revival 1960–1984 in single strip formatedit stereoscopic films largely remained dormant for the first part of the 1960s with those that were released usually being anaglyph exploitation films one film of notoriety was the beaverchampionwarner bros production the mask 1961 the film was shot in 2d but to enhance the bizarre qualities of the dreamworld that is induced when the main character puts on a cursed tribal mask these scenes went to anaglyph 3d these scenes were printed by technicolor on their first run in redgreen anaglyph although 3d films appeared sparsely during the early 1960s the true second wave of 3d cinema was set into motion by arch oboler the same producer who started the craze of the 1950s using a new technology called spacevision 3d the origin of spacevision 3d goes back to colonel robert vincent bernier a forgotten innovator in the history of stereoscopic motion pictures his trioptiscope spacevision lens was the gold standard for the production and exhibition of 3d films for nearly 30 years25spacevision 3d stereoscopic films were printed with two images one above the other in a single academy ratio frame on a single strip and needed only one projector fitted with a special lens this socalled over and under technique eliminated the need for dual projector setups and produced widescreen but darker less vivid polarized 3d images unlike earlier dual system it could stay in perfect synchronization unless improperly spliced in repair arch oboler once again had the vision for the system that no one else would touch and put it to use on his film entitled the bubble which starred michael cole deborah walley and johnny desmond as with bwana devil the critics panned the bubble but audiences flocked to see it and it became financially sound enough to promote the use of the system to other studios particularly independents who did not have the money for expensive dualstrip prints of their productions in 1970 stereovision a new entity founded by directorinventor allan silliphant and optical designer chris condon developed a different 35 mm singlestrip format which printed two images squeezed sidebyside and used an anamorphic lens to widen the pictures through polaroid filters louis k sher sherpix and stereovision released the softcore sex comedy the stewardesses selfrated x but later rerated r by the mpaa the film cost 100000 usd to produce and ran for months in several marketscitation needed eventually earning 27 million in north america alone 140 million in constant2010 dollars in fewer than 800 theaters becoming the most profitable 3dimensional film to date and in purely relative terms one of the most profitable films ever it was later released in 70 mm 3d some 36 films worldwide were made with stereovision over 25 years using either a widescreen abovebelow anamorphic side by side or 70 mm 3d formatscitation needed in 2009 the stewardesses was remastered by chris condon and director ed meyer releasing it in xpand 3d reald cinema and dolby 3d the quality of the 1970s 3d films was not much more inventive as many were either softcore and even hardcore adult films horror films or a combination of both paul morriseys flesh for frankenstein aka andy warhols frankenstein was a superlative example of such a combination between 1981 and 1983 there was a new hollywood 3d craze started by the spaghetti western comin at ya when parasite was released it was billed as the first horror film to come out in 3d in over 20 years horror films and reissues of 1950s 3d classics such as hitchcocks dial m for murder dominated the 3d releases that followed the second sequel in the friday the 13th series friday the 13th part iii was released very successfully apparently saying part 3 in 3d was considered too cumbersome so it was shortened in the titles of jaws 3d and amityville 3d which emphasized the screen effects to the point of being annoying at times especially when flashlights were shone into the eyes of the audience the science fiction film spacehunter adventures in the forbidden zone was the most expensive 3d film made up to that point with production costs about the same as star wars but not nearly the same box office success causing the craze to fade quickly through spring 1983 other scififantasy films were released as well including metalstorm the destruction of jaredsyn and treasure of the four crowns which was widely criticized for poor editing and plot holes but did feature some truly spectacular closeups 3d releases after the second craze included the man who wasnt there 1983 silent madness and the 1985 animated film starchaser the legend of orin whose plot seemed to borrow heavily from star wars only comin at ya parasite and friday the 13th part iii have been officially released on vhs andor dvd in 3d in the united states although amityville 3d has seen a 3d dvd release in the united kingdom most of the 1980s 3d films and some of the classic 1950s films such as house of wax were released on the now defunct video disc vhd format in japan as part of a system that used shutter glasses most of these have been unofficially transferred to dvd and are available on the grey market through sites such as ebay stereoscopic movies were also popular in other parts of the world such as my dear kuttichathan a malayalam film which was shot with stereoscopic 3d and released in 1984 rebirth of 3d 1985–2003edit in the mid1980s imax began producing nonfiction films for its nascent 3d business starting with we are born of stars roman kroitor 1985 a key point was that this production as with all subsequent imax productions emphasized mathematical correctness of the 3d rendition and thus largely eliminated the eye fatigue and pain that resulted from the approximate geometries of previous 3d incarnations in addition and in contrast to previous 35mm based 3d presentations the very large field of view provided by imax allowed a much broader 3d stage arguably as important in 3d film as it is theatre the walt disney company also began more prominent use of 3d films in special venues to impress audiences with magic journeys 1982 and captain eo francis ford coppola 1986 starring michael jackson being notable examples in the same year the national film board of canada production transitions colin low created for expo 86 in vancouver was the first imax presentation using polarized glasses echoes of the sun roman kroitor 1990 was the first imax film to be presented using alternateeye shutterglass technology a development required because the dome screen precluded the use of polarized technology from 1990 onward numerous films were produced by all three parties to satisfy the demands of their various highprofile special attractions and imaxs expanding 3d network films of special note during this period include the extremely successful into the deep graeme ferguson 1995 and the first imax 3d fiction film wings of courage 1996 by director jeanjacques

thereafter higher quality computer animation competition from dvds and other media digital projection digital video capture and the use of sophisticated imax 70mm film projectors created an opportunity for another wave of 3d films2728 mainstream resurgence 2003–presentedit in 2003 ghosts of the abyss by james cameron was released as the first fulllength 3d imax feature filmed with the

3d short film for the track bowling balls shot in highdefinition video29 shooting of the film hidden universe 3d with imax camera30 in november 2004 the polar express was released as imaxs first fulllength animated 3d feature it was released in 3584 theaters in 2d and only 66 imax locations the return from those few 3d theaters was about 25 of the total the 3d version earned about 14 times as much per screen as the 2d version this pattern continued and prompted a greatly intensified interest in 3d and 3d presentation of animated films in june 2005 the manns chinese 6 theatre in hollywood became the first commercial film theatre to be equipped with the digital 3d format both singin in the rain and the polar express were tested in the digital 3d format over the course of several months in november 2005 walt disney studio entertainment released chicken little in digital 3d format the butlers in love a short film directed by david arquette and starring elizabeth berkley and thomas jane31 was released on june 23 2008 the film was shot at the former industrial light magic studios using kernerfxs prototype kernercam stereoscopic camera rig ben walters suggests that both filmmakers and film exhibitors regain interest in 3d film there is now more 3d exhibition equipment and more dramatic films being shot in 3d format one incentive is that the technology is more mature shooting in 3d format is less limited and the result is more stable another incentive is the fact that while 2d ticket sales are in an overall state of decline revenues from 3d tickets continue to grow32 through the entire history of 3d presentations techniques to convert existing 2d images for 3d presentation have existed few have been effective or survived the combination of digital and digitized source material with relatively costeffective digital postprocessing has spawned a new wave of conversion products in june 2006 imax and warner bros released superman returns including 20 minutes of 3d images converted from the 2d original digital footage george lucas announced that he would rerelease his star wars films in 3d based on a conversion process from the company inthree later on in 2011 it was announced that lucas was working with the company prime focus on this conversion33 in late 2005 steven spielberg told the press he was involved in patenting a 3d cinema system that does not need glasses and which is based on plasma screens a computer splits each filmframe and then projects the two split images onto the screen at differing angles to be picked up by tiny angled ridges on

during the twoweek festival over 30 of the 50 golden era stereoscopic features as well as shorts were screened many coming from the collection of film historian and archivist robert furmanek who had spent the previous 15 years painstakingly tracking down and preserving each film to its original glory in attendance were many stars from each film respectively and some were moved to tears by the soldout seating with audiences of film buffs from all over the world who came to remember their previous glories in may 2006 the second world 3d exposition was announced for september of that year presented by the 3d film preservation fund along with the favorites of the previous exposition were newly discovered features and shorts and like the previous expo guests from each film expo ii was announced as being the locale for the world premiere of several films never before seen in 3d including the diamond wizard and the universal short hawaiian nights with mamie van doren and pinky lee other repremieres of films not seen since their original release in stereoscopic form included cease fire taza son of cochise wings of the hawk and those redheads from seattle also shown were the longlost shorts carmenesque and a day in the country both 1953 and william van doren kelleys two plasticon shorts 1922 and 1923 reported audience declineedit in the wake of its initial popularity and corresponding increase in the number of screens more films are being released in the 3d format for instance only 45 of the premiere weekend box office earnings of kung fu panda 2 came from 3d screenings as opposed to 60 for shrek forever after in 201037 in addition the premiere of cars 2 opening weekend gross consisted of only 37 from 3d theatres38 harry potter and the deathly hallows – part 2 and captain america the first avenger were major releases that achieved similar percentages 43 and 40 respectively39 in view of this trend there has been box office analysis concluding the implementation of 3d presentation is apparently backfiring by discouraging people from going to film theatres at all as brandon gray of box office mojo notes in each case 3ds moremoneyfromfewerpeople approach has simply led to less money from even fewer people40 according to the motion picture association of america despite a record total of 47 3d films being released in 2011 the overall domestic box office receipts were down 18 to 18 billion from 22 billion in 201041 although revenues as a whole increased during 2012 the bulk has so far come from 2d presentations as exemplified by little over 50 of filmgoers opting to see the likes of the avengers and 32 choosing brave in their 3d versions conflicting reasons are respectively offered by studios and exhibitors whereas the former blame more expensive 3d ticket prices the latter argue that the quality of films in general is at fault however despite the perceived decline of 3d in the us market studio chiefs are optimistic of better receipts internationally where there still appears to be a strong appetite for the format4243 studios are also using 3d to generate additional income from films that are already commercially successful such rereleases usually involve a conversion from 2d for example disney has reissued both the lion king and beauty and the beast with plans to add some of its other wellknown titles44 titanic has also been modified for 3d45 and there are also plans to similarly present all six star wars films46 jeffrey katzenberg a producer of 3d films and one of the leading proponents of the format blames oversaturation of the market with inferior films especially ones photographed conventionally and then digitally processed in postproduction he claims that such films have led audiences to conclude that the format is not worth the often much higher ticket price47 daniel engber a columnist for slate comes to a similar conclusion what happened to 3d it may have died from a case of acute septicemia—too much crap in the system48 however at the global box office there are six films whose combined 2d and 3d versions achieved grosses of over 1 billion each three in 2011 two in 2010 and one in 2009 film critic mark kermode a noted detractor of 3d has surmised that there is an emerging policy of distributors to limit the availability of 2d versions thus railroading the 3d format into cinemas whether the paying filmgoer likes it or not this was especially prevalent during the release of prometheus in 2012 where only 30 of prints for theatrical exhibition at least in the uk were in 2d49 his suspicions were later reinforced by a substantial number of complaints about dredd from those who wished to see it in 2d but were denied the opportunity50 in july 2017 imax announced that they will begin to focus on screening more hollywood tentpole movies in 2d even if theres a 3d version and have fewer 3d screenings of movies in north america citing that moviegoers in north america prefer 2d films over 3d films51 techniquesedit see also stereoscopy stereoscopic motion pictures can be produced through a variety of different methods over the years the popularity of systems being widely employed in film theaters has waxed and waned though anaglyph was sometimes used prior to 1948 during the early golden era of 3d cinematography of the 1950s the polarization system was used for every single featurelength film in the united states and all but one short film52 in the 21st century polarization 3d systems have continued to dominate the scene though during the 1960s and 1970s some classic films which were converted to anaglyph for theaters not equipped for polarization and were even shown in 3d on television53 in the years following the mid1980s some films were made with short segments in anaglyph 3d the following are some of the technical details and methodologies employed in some of the more notable 3d film systems that have been developed producing 3d filmsedit live actionedit main article stereo photography techniques the standard for shooting liveaction films in 3d involves using two cameras mounted so that their lenses are about as far apart from each other as the average pair of human eyes recording two separate images for both the left eye and the right eye in principle two normal 2d cameras could be put sidetoside but this is problematic in many ways the only real option is to invest in new stereoscopic cameras moreover some cinematographic tricks that are simple with a 2d camera become impossible when filming in 3d this means those otherwise cheap tricks need to be replaced by expensive cgi54 in 2008 journey to the center of the earth became the first liveaction feature film to be shot with the earliest fusion camera system released in digital 3d and was later followed by several others avatar 2009 was shot in a 3d process that is based on how the human eye looks at an image it was an improvement to the existing 3d camera system many 3d camera rigs still in use simply pair two cameras side by side while newer rigs are paired with a beam splitter or both camera lenses built into one unit while digital cinema cameras are not a requirement for 3d they are the predominant medium for most of what is photographed film options include imax 3d and cine 160 animationedit in the 1930s and 1940s fleischer studio made several cartoons with extensive stereoscopic 3d backgrounds including several popeye cartoons betty boops and superman in the early to mid1950s only half of the major animation film studios operation experimented with creating traditional 3d animated short subjects walt disney studio produced two traditional animation short for stereoscopic 3d for cinemas adventures in music melody 1952 and the donald duck cartoon working for peanuts 1953 warner brothers only produced a single cartoon in 3d lumber jackrabbit 1953 starring bugs bunny famous studio produced two cartoons in 3d the popeye cartoon popeye the ace of space 1953 and the casper the friendly ghost cartoon boo moon 1954 walter lantz studio produced the woody woodpecker cartoon hypnotic hick 1953 which was distributed by universal from the late 1950s until the mid2000s almost no animation was produced for 3d display in theaters although several films used 3d backgrounds one exception is starchaser the legend of

cgianimated film in 3d the first 3d feature by dreamworks animation monsters vs aliens followed in 2009 and used a new digital rendering process called intru3d which was developed by intel to create more realistic animated 3d images intru3d is not used to exhibit 3d films in theaters they are shown in either reald 3d or imax 3d 2d to 3d conversionedit main article 2d to 3d conversion in the case of 2d cgi animated films that were generated from 3d models it is possible to return to the models to generate a 3d version for all other 2d films different techniques must be employed for example for the 3d rerelease of the 1993 film the nightmare before christmas walt disney pictures scanned each original frame and manipulated them to produce lefteye and righteye versions dozens of films have now been converted from 2d to 3d there are several approaches used for 2d to 3d conversion most notably depthbased methods55 however conversion to 3d has problems information is unavailable as 2d doesnt have information for a perspective view some tvs have a 3d engine to convert 2d content to 3d usually on high frame rate contentand on some slower processors even normal frame rate the processor isnt fast enough and lag is possible this can lead to strange visual effects56 displaying 3d filmsedit see also 3d television and 3d display anaglyphedit main article anaglyph 3d the archetypal 3d glasses with modern red and cyan color filters similar to the redgreen and redblue lenses used to view early anaglyph films anaglyph images were the earliest method of presenting theatrical 3d and the one most commonly associated with stereoscopy by the public at large mostly because of nontheatrical 3d media such as comic books and 3d television broadcasts where polarization is not practical they were made popular because of the ease of their production and exhibition the first anaglyph film was invented in 1915 by edwin s porter though the earliest theatrical presentations were done with this system most 3d films from the 1950s and 1980s were originally shown polarized57 in an anaglyph the two images are superimposed in an additive light setting through two filters one red and one cyan in a subtractive light setting the two images are printed in the same complementary colors on white paper glasses with colored filters in each eye separate the appropriate images by canceling the filter color out and rendering the complementary color black anaglyph images are much easier to view than either parallel sighting or crossed eye stereograms although the latter types offer bright and accurate color rendering particularly in the red component which is muted or desaturated with even the best color anaglyphs a compensating technique commonly known as anachrome uses a slightly more transparent cyan filter in the patented glasses associated with the technique process reconfigures the typical anaglyph image to have less parallax an alternative to the usual red and cyan filter system of anaglyph is colorcode 3d a patented anaglyph system which was invented in order to present an anaglyph image in conjunction with the ntsc television standard in which the red channel is often compromised colorcode uses the complementary colors of yellow and dark blue onscreen and the colors of the glasses lenses are amber and dark blue the polarization 3d system has been the standard for theatrical presentations since it was used for bwana devil in 195257 though early imax presentations were done using the eclipse system and in the 1960s and 1970s classic 3d films were sometimes converted to anaglyph for special presentations the polarization system has better color fidelity and less ghosting than the anaglyph system in the post50s era anaglyph has been used instead of polarization in feature presentations where only part of the film is in 3d such as in the 3d segment of freddys dead the final nightmare and the 3d segments of spy kids 3d game over anaglyph is also used in printed materials and in 3d television broadcasts where polarization is not practical 3d polarized televisions and other displays only became available from several manufacturers in 2008 these generate polarization on the receiving end polarization systemsedit cardboard 3d linear polarized glasses from the 1980s similar to those used in the 1950s though some were plain white they often had the name of the theatre andor graphics from the film main article polarized 3d system to present a stereoscopic motion picture two images are projected superimposed onto the same screen through different polarizing filters the viewer wears lowcost eyeglasses which also contain a pair of polarizing filters oriented differently clockwisecounterclockwise with circular polarization or at 90 degree angles usually 45 and 135 degrees58 with linear polarization as each filter passes only that light which is similarly polarized and blocks the light polarized differently each eye sees a different image this is used to produce a threedimensional effect by projecting the same scene into both eyes but depicted from slightly different perspectives since no head tracking is involved the entire audience can view the stereoscopic images at the same time additionally since both lenses have the same color people with one dominant eye amblyopia where one eye is used more are able to see the 3d effect previously negated by the separation of the two colors resembling sunglasses reald circular polarized glasses are now the standard for theatrical releases and theme park attractions circular polarization has an advantage over linear polarization in that the viewer does not need to have their head upright and aligned with the screen for the polarization to work properly with linear polarization turning the glasses sideways causes the filters to go out of alignment with the screen filters causing the image to fade and for each eye to see the opposite frame more easily for circular polarization the polarizing effect works regardless of how the viewers head is aligned with the screen such as tilted sideways or even upside down the left eye will still only see the image intended for it and vice versa without fading or crosstalk nonetheless 3d cinema films are made to be viewed without head tilt and any significant head tilt will result in incorrect parallax and prevent binocular fusion in the case of reald a circularly polarizing liquid crystal filter which can switch polarity 144 times per second is placed in front of the projector lens only one projector is needed as the left and right eye images are displayed alternately sony features a new system called reald xls which shows both circular polarized images simultaneously a single 4k projector 4096×2160 resolution displays both 2k images 2048×1080 resolution on top of each other at the same time a special lens attachment polarizes and projects the images59 optical attachments can be added to traditional 35mm projectors to adapt them for projecting film in the overandunder format in which each pair of images is stacked within one frame of film the two images are projected through different polarizers and superimposed on the screen this is a very costeffective way to convert a theater for 3d as all that is needed are the attachments and a nondepolarizing screen surface rather than a conversion to digital 3d projection thomson technicolor currently produces an adapter of this type60 a metallic screen is necessary for these systems as reflection from nonmetallic surfaces destroys the polarization of the light polarized stereoscopic pictures have been around since 1936 when edwin h land first applied it to motion pictures the socalled 3d movie craze in the years 1952 through 1955 was almost entirely offered in theaters using linear polarizing projection and glasses only a minute amount of the total 3d films shown in the period used the anaglyph color filter method linear polarization was likewise used with consumer level stereo projectors polarization was also used during the 3d revival of the 1980s in the 2000s computer animation competition from dvds and other media digital projection and the use of sophisticated imax 70mm film projectors have created an opportunity for a new wave of polarized 3d films2728 all types of polarization will result in a darkening of the displayed image and poorer contrast compared to non3d images light from lamps is normally emitted as a random collection of polarizations while a polarization filter only passes a fraction of the light as a result the screen image is darker this darkening can be compensated by increasing the brightness of the projector light source if the initial polarization filter is inserted between the lamp and the image generation element the light intensity striking the image element is not any higher than normal without the polarizing filter and overall image contrast transmitted to the screen is not affected active shutteredit a pair of lcd shutter glasses used to view xpand 3d films the thick frames conceal the electronics and batteries main article active shutter 3d system in this technology a mechanism is used to block light from each appropriate eye when the converse eyes image is projected on the screen the technology originated with the eclipse method in which the projector alternates between left and right images and opens and closes the shutters in the glasses or viewer in synchronization with the images on the screencitation needed this was the basis of the teleview system which was used briefly in 19221061 a newer implementation of the eclipse method came with lcd shutter glasses glasses containing liquid crystal that will let light through in synchronization with the images on the cinema television or computer screen using the concept of alternateframe sequencing this is the method used by nvidia xpand 3d and earlier imax systems a drawback of this method is the need for each person viewing to wear expensive electronic glasses that must be synchronized with the display system using a wireless signal or attached wire the shutterglasses are heavier than most polarized glasses though lighter models are no heavier than some sunglasses or deluxe polarized glasses62 however these systems do not require a silver screen for projected images liquid crystal light valves work by rotating light between two polarizing filters due to these internal polarizers lcd shutterglasses darken the display image of any lcd plasma or projector image source which has the result that images appear dimmer and contrast is lower than for normal non3d viewing this is not necessarily a usage problem for some types of displays which are already very bright with poor grayish black levels lcd shutter glasses may actually improve the image quality interference filter technologyedit main article anaglyph 3d § interference filter systems dolby 3d uses specific wavelengths of red green and blue for the right eye and different wavelengths of red green and blue for the left eye eyeglasses which filter out the very specific wavelengths allow the wearer to see a 3d image this technology eliminates the expensive silver screens required for polarized systems such as reald which is the most common 3d display system in theaters it does however require much more expensive glasses than the polarized systems it is also known as spectral comb filtering or wavelength multiplex visualization the recently introduced omega 3dpanavision 3d system also uses this technology though with a wider spectrum and more teeth to the comb 5 for each eye in the omegapanavision system the use of more spectral bands per eye eliminates the need to color process the image required by the dolby system evenly dividing the visible spectrum between the eyes gives the viewer a more relaxed feel as the light energy and color balance is nearly 5050 like the dolby system the omega system can be used with white or silver screens but it can be used with either film or digital projectors unlike the dolby filters that are only used on a digital system with a color correcting processor provided by dolby the omegapanavision system also claims that their glasses are cheaper to manufacture than those used by dolby63 in june 2012 the omega 3dpanavision 3d system was discontinued by dpvo theatrical who marketed it on behalf of panavision citing challenging global economic and 3d market conditions64 although dpvo dissolved its business operations omega optical continues promoting and selling 3d systems to nontheatrical markets omega opticals 3d system contains projection filters and 3d glasses in addition to the passive stereoscopic 3d system omega optical has produced enhanced anaglyph 3d glasses the omegas redcyan anaglyph glasses use complex metal oxide thin film coatings and high quality annealed glass optics autostereoscopyedit main article autostereoscopy in this method glasses are not necessary to see the stereoscopic image lenticular lens and parallax barrier technologies involve imposing two or more images on the same sheet in narrow alternating strips and using a screen that either blocks one of the two images strips in the case of parallax barriers or uses equally narrow lenses to bend the strips of image and make it appear to fill the entire image in the case of lenticular prints to produce the stereoscopic effect the person must be positioned so that one eye sees one of the two images and the other sees the other both images are projected onto a highgain corrugated screen which reflects light at acute angles in order to see the stereoscopic image the viewer must sit within a very narrow angle that is nearly perpendicular to the screen limiting the size of the audience lenticular was used for theatrical presentation of numerous shorts in russia from 1940–194853 and in 1946 for the featurelength film robinson crusoe65 though its use in theatrical presentations has been rather limited lenticular has been widely used for a variety of novelty items and has even been used in amateur 3d photography6667 recent use includes the fujifilm finepix real 3d with an autostereoscopic display that was released in 2009 other examples for this technology include autostereoscopic lcd displays on monitors notebooks tvs mobile phones and gaming devices such as the nintendo 3ds health effectsedit some viewers have complained of headaches and eyestrain after watching 3d films68 motion sickness in addition to other health concerns69 are more easily induced by 3d presentations one published study shows that of those who watch 3d films nearly 55 experience varying levels of headaches nausea and disorientation70 there are two primary effects of 3d film that are unnatural for human vision crosstalk between the eyes caused by imperfect image separation and the mismatch between convergence and accommodation caused by the difference between an objects perceived position in front of or behind the screen and the real origin of that light on the screen it is believed that approximately 12 of people are unable to properly see 3d images due to a variety of medical conditions7172 according to another experiment up to 30 of people have very weak stereoscopic vision preventing them from depth perception based on stereo disparity this nullifies or greatly decreases immersion effects of digital stereo to them73 it has recently been discovered that each of the rods and cones in animal eyes can measure the distance to the point on the object that is in focus at the particular rod or cone each rod or cone can act as a passive lidar light detection and ranging the lens selects the point on the object for each pixel to which the distance is measured that is humans can see in 3d separately with each eye74 if the brain uses this ability in addition to the stereoscopic effect and other cues no stereoscopic system can present a true 3d picture to the brain the french national research agency anr has sponsored multidisciplinary research in order to understand the effects of 3d film viewing its grammar and its acceptance75 criticismedit “ after toy story there were 10 really bad cg movies because everybody thought the success of that film was cg and not great characters that were beautifully designed and heartwarming now youve got people quickly converting movies from 2d to 3d which is not what we did theyre expecting the same result when in fact they will probably work against the adoption of 3d because theyll be putting out an inferior product ” —  avatar director james cameron76 most of the cues required to provide humans with relative depth information are already present in traditional 2d films for example closer objects occlude further ones distant objects are desaturated and hazy relative to near ones and the brain subconsciously knows the distance of many objects when the height is known eg a human figure subtending only a small amount of the screen is more likely to be 2 m tall and far away than 10 cm tall and close in fact only two of these depth cues are not already present in 2d films stereopsis or parallax and the focus of the eyeball accommodation 3d filmmaking addresses accurate presentation of stereopsis but not of accommodation and therefore is insufficient in providing a complete 3d illusion however promising results from research aimed at overcoming this shortcoming were presented at the 2010 stereoscopic displays and applications conference in san jose us77 film critic mark kermode78 argued that 3d adds not that much value to a film and said that while he liked avatar the many impressive things he saw in the film had nothing to do with 3d kermode has been an outspoken critic of 3d film describing the effect as a nonsense and recommends using two right or left lenses from the 3d glasses to cut out the pointy pointy 3d stereoscopic vision although this technique still does not improve the huge brightness loss from a 3d film79 versions of these 2d glasses are being marketed80 as pointed out in the article virtual space – the movies of the future81not in citation given in real life the 3d effect or stereoscopic vision depends on the distance between the eyes which is only about 2 12 inches the depth perception this affords is only noticeable near to the head – at about arms length it is only useful for such tasks as threading a needle it follows that in films portraying real life the 3d effect is barely noticeable and is soon forgotten as the film proceeds director christopher nolan has criticised the notion that traditional film does not allow depth perception saying i think its a misnomer to call it 3d versus 2d the whole point of cinematic imagery is its three dimensional you know 95 of our depth cues come from occlusion resolution color and so forth so the idea of calling a 2d movie a 2d movie is a little misleading82 nolan also criticised that shooting on the required digital video does not offer a high enough quality image83 and that 3d cameras cannot be equipped with prime nonzoom lenses82 late film critic roger ebert repeatedly criticized 3d film as being too dim sometimes distracting or even nauseainducing and argued that it is an expensive technology that adds nothing of value to the filmgoing experience since 2d films already provide a sufficient illusion of 3d84 while ebert was not opposed to 3d as an option he opposed it as a replacement for traditional film and preferred 2d technologies such as maxivision48 that improve image arearesolution and frames per second84 brightness concernsedit most 3d systems will cut down the brightness of the picture considerably – the light loss can be as high as 88 some of this loss may be compensated by running the projectors bulb at higher power or using more powerful bulbs85 the 2d brightness cinema standard is 14 footlamberts 48 candela per square metre as set by the smpte standard 196m as of 2012update there is no official standard for 3d brightness according to the industry de facto standard however the acceptable brightness range goes as low as 35 fl 12 cdm2 – just 25 of the standard 2d brightness86 among others christopher nolan has criticized the huge brightness loss youre not that aware of it because once youre in that world your eye compensates but having struggled for years to get theaters up to the proper brightness were not sticking polarized filters in everything87 in september 2012 the dci standards body issued a recommended practice calling for a 3d projection brightness of 7 fl 24 cdm2 with an acceptable range of 5–9 fl 17–31 cdm23 it is not known how many theaters actually achieve such light levels with current technology prototype laser projection systems have reached 14 fl 48 cdm2 for 3d on a cinema screen4 postconversionedit main article 2d to 3d conversion another major criticism is that many of the films in the 21st century to date were not filmed in 3d but converted into 3d after filming filmmakers who have criticized the quality of this process include james cameron whose film avatar was created mostly in 3d from the ground up with some portions of the film created in 2d88 and is largely credited with the revival of 3d and michael bay76 however cameron has said that quality 2d conversions can be done if they take the time they need and the director is involved89 in contrast computeranimated films for which the original computer models are still available can be rendered in 3d easily as the depth information is still available and does not need to be inferred or approximated this has been done with toy story
