roosevelt 1860–1894 and anna rebecca hall 1863–18929 from an early age she preferred to be called by her middle name eleanor through her father she was a niece of president theodore roosevelt 1858–1919 through her mother she was a niece of tennis champions valentine gill vallie hall iii 1867–1934 and edward ludlow hall 1872–1932 her mother nicknamed her granny because she acted in such a serious manner as a child10 her mother was also somewhat ashamed of eleanors plainness10 eleanor had two younger brothers elliott jr 1889–1893 and gracie hall roosevelt usually called hall 1891–1941 she also had a half brother elliott roosevelt mann 1891–1976 through her fathers affair with katy mann a servant employed by the family11 roosevelt was born into a world of immense wealth and privilege as her family was part of new york high society called the swells12 her mother died from diphtheria on december 7 1892 and elliott jr died of the same disease the following may13 her father an alcoholic confined to a sanitarium died on august 14 1894 after jumping from a window during a fit of delirium tremens he survived the fall but died from a seizure14 eleanors childhood losses left her prone to depression throughout her life14 her brother hall later suffered from alcoholism15 before her father died he implored her to act as a mother towards hall and it was a request she made good upon for the rest of halls life eleanor doted on hall and when he enrolled at groton school in 1907 she accompanied him as a chaperone while he was attending groton she wrote him almost daily but always felt a touch of guilt that hall had not had a fuller childhood she took pleasure in halls brilliant performance at school and was proud of his many academic accomplishments which included a masters degree in engineering from harvard16 after the deaths of her parents eleanor was raised in the household of her maternal grandmother mary livingston ludlow 1843–1919 of the livingston family in tivoli new york14 in his pulitzer prizewinning biography of eleanor roosevelt eleanor and franklin the story of their relationship based on eleanor roosevelts private papers 1971 joseph p lash describes her in childhood as insecure and starved for affection and she considered herself the ugly duckling12 however roosevelt wrote at 14 that ones prospects in life were not totally dependent on physical beauty no matter how plain a woman may be if truth and loyalty are stamped upon her face all will be attracted to her17 roosevelt was tutored privately and with the encouragement of her aunt anna bamie roosevelt 15yearold eleanor was sent to allenswood academy a private finishing school in wimbledon outside london england18 where she was educated from 1899 to 1902 the headmistress marie souvestre was a noted feminist educator who sought to cultivate independent thinking in young women souvestre took a special interest in roosevelt who learned to speak french fluently and gained selfconfidence19 roosevelt and souvestre maintained a correspondence until march 1905 when souvestre died and after this eleanor placed souvestres portrait on her desk and brought her letters with her19 eleanors first cousin corinne douglas robinson whose first term at allenswood overlapped with eleanors last said that when she arrived at the school eleanor was everything at the school she was beloved by everybody20 roosevelt wished to continue at allenswood but she was summoned home by her grandmother in 1902 to make her social debut19 at age 17 in 1902 roosevelt completed her formal education and returned to the united states she was presented at a debutante ball at the waldorfastoria hotel on december 14 she was later given her own coming out party21 she said of her debut in a public discussion once as later recounted in her new york times obituary it was simply awful it was a beautiful party of course but i was so unhappy because a girl who comes out is so utterly miserable if she does not know all the young people of course i had been so long abroad that i had lost touch with all the girls i used to know in new york i was miserable through all that5 roosevelt was active with the new york junior league shortly after its founding teaching dancing and calisthenics in the east side slums21 the organization had been brought to roosevelts attention by her friend organization founder mary harriman and a male relative who criticized the group for drawing young women into public activity22 marriage and family life in the summer of 1902 eleanor encountered her fathers fifth cousin franklin delano roosevelt on a train to tivoli new york23 the two began a secret correspondence and romance and became engaged on november 22 190324 franklins mother sara ann delano opposed the union and made him promise that the engagement would not be officially announced for a year i know what pain i must have caused you he wrote his mother of his decision but he added i know my own mind and known it for a long time and know that i could never think otherwise25 sara took her son on a caribbean cruise in 1904 hoping that a separation would squelch the romance but franklin remained determined25 the wedding date was set to accommodate president theodore roosevelt who was scheduled to be in new york city for the st patricks day parade and who agreed to give the bride away26 eleanor and franklin were married on march 17 1905 in a wedding officiated by endicott peabody the grooms headmaster at groton school2327 her cousin corinne douglas robinson was a bridesmaid theodore roosevelts attendance at the ceremony was frontpage news in the new york times and other newspapers when asked for his thoughts on the rooseveltroosevelt union the president said it is a good thing to keep the name in the family the couple spent a preliminary honeymoon of one week at hyde park then set up housekeeping in an apartment in new york that summer they went on their formal honeymoon a threemonth tour of europe28 eleanor and franklin with their first two children 1908 returning to the us the newlyweds settled in a new york city house that was provided by franklins mother as well as in a second residence at the familys estate overlooking the hudson river in hyde park new york from the beginning eleanor had a contentious relationship with her controlling motherinlaw the townhouse that sara gave to eleanor and franklin was connected to her own residence by sliding doors and sara ran both households in the decade after the marriage early on eleanor had a breakdown in which she explained to franklin that i did not like to live in a house which was not in any way mine one that i had done nothing about and which did not represent the way i wanted to live but little changed29 sara also sought to control the raising of her grandchildren and eleanor reflected later that franklins children were more my motherinlaws children than they were mine30 eleanors eldest son james remembered sara telling her grandchildren your mother only bore you i am more your mother than your mother is30 eleanor and franklin had six children anna eleanor roosevelt 1906 – 1975 james roosevelt ii 1907 – 1991 franklin roosevelt 1909 – 1909 elliott roosevelt 1910 – 1990 franklin delano roosevelt jr 1914 – 1988 john aspinwall roosevelt ii 1916 – 1981 despite becoming pregnant six times eleanor disliked having sex with her husband she once told her daughter anna that it was an ordeal to be borne31 she also considered herself illsuited to motherhood later writing it did not come naturally to me to understand little children or to enjoy them30 in september 1918 eleanor was unpacking one of franklins suitcases when she discovered a bundle of love letters to him from her social secretary lucy mercer he had been contemplating leaving eleanor for lucy however following pressure from his political advisor louis howe and from his mother who threatened to disinherit franklin if he followed through with a divorce the couple remained married32 their union from that point on was more of a political partnership disillusioned eleanor again became active in public life and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife as she had for the previous decade33 in august 1921 the family was vacationing at campobello island new brunswick canada when franklin was diagnosed with polio3435 which permanently paralyzed his legs when the extent of his disability became clear eleanor fought a protracted battle with her motherinlaw over his future persuading him to stay in politics despite saras urgings that he retire and become a country gentleman later joseph p lash noted that franklins attending physician dr william keen had commended eleanors devotion to the stricken franklin during the time of his travail with polio you have been a rare wife and have borne your heavy burden most bravely he said proclaiming her one of my heroines36 this proved a turning point in eleanor and saras longrunning struggle and as eleanors public role grew she increasingly broke from saras control3738 tensions between sara and eleanor over her new political friends rose to the point that the family constructed a cottage at valkill in which eleanor and her guests lived when franklin and the children were away from hyde park3940 eleanor herself named the place valkill loosely translated as waterfallstream41 from the dutch language common to the original european settlers of the area franklin encouraged eleanor to develop this property as a place where she could implement some of her ideas for work with winter jobs for rural workers and women each year when eleanor held a picnic at valkill for delinquent boys her granddaughter eleanor roosevelt seagraves assisted her she was close to eleanor throughout her life seagraves concentrated her career as an educator and librarian on keeping alive many of the causes eleanor began and supported in 1924 she campaigned for democrat alfred e smith in his successful reelection bid as governor of new york state against the republican nominee and her first cousin theodore roosevelt jr42 theodore never forgave eleanor her aunt anna bamie roosevelt publicly broke with eleanor after she wrote of eleanor to her son i just hate to see eleanor let herself look as she does though never handsome she always had to me a charming effect alas and alack ever since politics have become her choicest interest all her charm has disappeared eleanor dismissed bamies criticisms by referring to her as an aged woman bamie and eleanor eventually reconciled and in an article in the ladies home journal how to take criticism eleanor referred to her saying i can honestly say that i hate no one and perhaps the best advice i can give to anyone who suffers from criticism and yet must be in the public eye would be contained in the words of my aunt mrs william sheffield cowles she was president theodore roosevelts sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice i had asked her whether i should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism and her answer was do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are sure that you are doing what seems right to you but be sure that you face yourself honestly43 theodores elder daughter alice also broke with eleanor over her campaign alice and eleanor reconciled after eleanor wrote alice a comforting letter upon the death of alices daughter paulina longworth eleanor and her daughter anna became estranged after she took over some of her mothers social duties at the white house the relationship was further strained because eleanor desperately wanted to go with her husband to yalta in february 1945 two months before fdrs death but he took anna instead a few years later the two were able to reconcile and cooperate on numerous projects anna took care of her mother when she was terminally ill in 1962 eleanors son elliott authored numerous books including a mystery series in which eleanor was the detective however these murder mysteries were researched and written by william harrington they continued until harringtons death in 2000 ten years after elliotts death44 with james brough elliot also wrote a highly personal book about his parents called the roosevelts of hyde park an untold story in which he revealed details about the sexual lives of his parents including his fathers relationships with mistress lucy mercer and secretary marguerite missy lehand45 as well as graphic details surrounding the illness that crippled his father published in 1973 the biography also contains valuable insights into fdrs run for vicepresident his rise to the governorship of new york and his capture of the presidency in 1932 particularly with the help of louis howe when elliott published this book in 1973 franklin delano roosevelt jr led the familys denunciation of him the book was fiercely repudiated by all elliots siblings another of the siblings james published my parents a differing view with bill libby 1976 which was written in part as a response to elliots book a sequel to an untold story with james brough published in 1975 and titled a rendezvous with destiny carried the roosevelt saga to the end of world war ii mother r eleanor roosevelts untold story also with brough was published in 1977 eleanor roosevelt with love a centenary remembrance came out in 1984 other relationships roosevelt with her dog fala in 1951 in the 1930s eleanor had a very close relationship with legendary aviator amelia earhart one time the two sneaked out from the white house and went to a party dressed up for the occasion after flying with earhart roosevelt obtained a student permit but did not further pursue her plans to learn to fly franklin was not in favor of his wife becoming a pilot however the two friends communicated frequently throughout their lives46 roosevelt also had a close relationship with associated press ap reporter lorena hickok who covered her during the last months of the presidential campaign and fell madly in love with her47 during this period roosevelt wrote daily 10 to 15page letters to hick who was planning to write a biography of the first lady48 the letters included such endearments as i want to put my arms around you kiss you at the corner of your mouth49 and i cant kiss you so i kiss your picture good night and good morning50 at franklins 1933 inauguration eleanor wore a sapphire ring hickok had given her51 fbi director j edgar hoover despised roosevelts liberalism her stance regarding civil rights and her and her husband fdrs criticisms of hoovers surveillance tactics and so hoover maintained a large file on roosevelt52 which the filmmakers of the biopic j edgar 2011 indicate included compromising evidence of this relationship which hoover intended to blackmail roosevelt with compromised as a reporter hickok soon resigned her position with the ap to be closer to eleanor who secured her a job as an investigator for a new deal program53 there is considerable debate about whether or not roosevelt had a sexual relationship with hickok it was known in the white house press corps at the time that lorena hickok was a lesbian54 scholars including lillian faderman51 and hazel rowley55 have asserted that there was a physical component to the relationship while hickok biographer doris faber has argued that the insinuative phrases have misled historians doris kearns goodwin stated in her 1994 pulitzer prize–winning account of the roosevelts that whether hick and eleanor went beyond kisses and hugs could not be determined with certainty56 roosevelt was close friends with several lesbian couples such as nancy cook and marion dickerman and esther lape and elizabeth read suggesting that she understood lesbianism marie souvestre roosevelts childhood teacher and a great influence on her later thinking was also a lesbian55 faber published some of roosevelt and hickoks correspondence in 1980 but concluded that the lovestruck phrasing was simply an unusually belated schoolgirl crush57 and warned historians not to be misled56 researcher leila j rupp criticized fabers argument calling her book a case study in homophobia and arguing that faber unwittingly presented page after page of evidence that delineates the growth and development of a love affair between the two women58 in 1992 roosevelt biographer blanche wiesen cook argued that the relationship was in fact romantic generating national attention575960 a 2011 essay by russell baker reviewing two new roosevelt biographies in the new york times review of books franklin and eleanor an extraordinary marriage by hazel rowley and eleanor roosevelt transformative first lady by maurine h beasley stated that the hickok relationship was indeed erotic now seems beyond dispute considering what is known about the letters they exchanged50 in the same years washington gossip linked eleanor romantically with new deal administrator harry hopkins with whom she worked closely61 roosevelt also had a close relationship with new york state police sergeant earl miller who was assigned by the president to be her bodyguard62 roosevelt was 44 years old when she met miller 32 in 1929 he became her friend as well as official escort taught her different sports such as diving and riding and coached her in tennis biographer blanche wiesen cook writes that miller was eleanors first romantic involvement in her middle years63 hazel rowley concludes there is no doubt that eleanor was in love with earl for a time  but they are most unlikely to have had an affair64 eleanors friendship with miller occurred at the same time that her husband had a rumored relationship with his secretary marguerite missy lehand smith writes remarkably both er and franklin recognized accepted and encouraged the arrangementeleanor and franklin were strongwilled people who cared greatly for each others happiness but realized their own inability to provide for it65 eleanor and millers relationship is said to have continued until her death in 1962 they are thought to have corresponded daily but all letters have been lost according to rumor the letters were anonymously purchased and destroyed or locked away when she died66 eleanor was longtime friends with carrie chapman catt and gave her the chi omega award at the white house in 194167 in later years eleanor was said to have developed a romantic attachment to her physician david gurewitsch though it was likely limited to a deep friendship6869 public life before the white house roosevelt in 1932 eleanor and franklin roosevelt in august 1932 in the 1920 presidential election franklin was nominated as the running mate of democratic presidential candidate james m cox eleanor joined franklin in touring the country making her first campaign appearances70 cox and roosevelt were defeated by republican warren g harding who won with 404 electoral votes to 127 electoral votes71 following the onset of franklins polio in 1921 eleanor began serving as a standin for her incapacitated husband making public appearances on his behalf often carefully coached by louis howe72 she also started working with the womens trade union league wtul raising funds in support of the unions goals a 48hour work week minimum wage and the abolition of child labor12 throughout the 1920s eleanor became increasingly influential as a leader in the new york state democratic party while franklin used her contacts among democratic women to strengthen his standing with them winning their committed support for the future72 in 1924 she campaigned for democrat alfred e smith in his successful reelection bid as governor of new york state against the republican nominee and her first cousin theodore roosevelt jr42 franklin had spoken out on theodores wretched record as assistant secretary of the navy during the oil scandals and in return theodore said of him hes a maverick he does not wear the brand of our family which infuriated eleanor she dogged theodore on the new york state campaign trail in a car fitted with a papiermâché bonnet shaped like a giant teapot that was made to emit simulated steam to remind voters of theodores supposed but later disproved connections to the teapot dome scandal and countered his speeches with those of her own calling him immature73 she would later decry these methods admitting that they were below her dignity but saying that they had been contrived by democratic party dirty tricksters theodore was defeated by 105000 votes and he never forgave eleanor by 1928 eleanor was promoting smiths candidacy for president and franklins nomination as the democratic partys candidate for governor of new york succeeding smith although smith lost the presidential race franklin won handily and the roosevelts moved into the governors mansion in albany new york74 during franklins term as governor eleanor traveled widely in the state to make speeches and inspect state facilities on his behalf reporting her findings to him at the end of each trip75 in 1927 she joined friends marion dickerman and nancy cook in buying the todhunter school for girls a finishing school which also offered college preparatory courses in new york city at the school roosevelt taught upperlevel courses in american literature and history emphasizing independent thought current events and social engagement she continued to teach three days a week while fdr served as governor but was forced to leave teaching after his election as president7677 also in 1927 she established valkill industries with nancy cook marion dickerman and caroline oday three friends she met through her activities in the womens division of the new york state democratic party it was located on the banks of a stream that flowed through the roosevelt family estate in hyde park new york roosevelt and her business partners financed the construction of a small factory to provide supplemental income for local farming families who would make furniture pewter and homespun cloth using traditional craft methods capitalizing on the popularity of the colonial revival most valkill products were modeled on eighteenthcentury forms roosevelt promoted valkill through interviews and public appearances valkill industries never became the subsistence program that roosevelt and her friends imagined but it did pave the way for larger new deal initiatives during franklins presidential administration nancys failing health and pressures from the great depression compelled the women to dissolve the partnership in 1938 at which time roosevelt converted the shop buildings into a cottage at valkill that eventually became her permanent residence after franklin died in 1945 otto berge acquired the contents of the factory and the use of the valkill name to continue making colonialstyle furniture until he retired in 1975 in 1977 roosevelts cottage at valkill and its surrounding property of 181 acres 073 km278 was formally designated by an act of congress as the eleanor roosevelt national historic site to commemorate for the education inspiration and benefit of present and future generations the life and work of an outstanding woman in american history78 first lady of the united states 1933–1945 play media roosevelt making an appeal for the red cross may 22 1940 eleanor became first lady of the united states when fdr was inaugurated on march 4 1933 having known all of the twentieth centurys previous first ladies she was seriously depressed at having to assume the role which had traditionally been restricted to domesticity and hostessing79 her immediate predecessor lou henry hoover had ended her feminist activism on becoming first lady stating her intention to be only a backdrop for bertie80 eleanors distress at these precedents was severe enough that hickok subtitled her biography of roosevelt reluctant first lady81 with support from howe and hickok roosevelt set out to redefine the position according to her biographer cook she became the most controversial first lady in united states history in the process81 despite criticism of them both with her husbands strong support she continued with the active business and speaking agenda she had begun before assuming the role of first lady in an era when few married women had careers she was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences and in 1940 became the first to speak at a national party convention82 she also wrote a daily and widely syndicated newspaper column my day another first for a presidential spouse8384 she was also the first first lady to write a monthly magazine column and to host a weekly radio show85 in the first year of fdrs administration eleanor was determined to match her husbands presidential salary and she earned 75000 from her lectures and writing most of which she gave to charity86 by 1941 she was receiving lecture fees of 100040 roosevelt maintained a heavy travel schedule in her twelve years in the white house frequently making personal appearances at labor meetings to assure depressionera workers that the white house was mindful of their plight in one famous cartoon of the time from the new yorker magazine june 3 1933 satirizing a visit she had made to a mine an astonished coal miner peering down a dark tunnel says to a coworker for gosh sakes here comes mrs roosevelt6987 roosevelt center king george vi and queen elizabeth in london october 23 1942 in early 1933 the bonus army a protest group of world war i veterans marched on washington for the second time in two years calling for their veteran bonus certificates to be awarded early the previous year president herbert hoover had ordered them dispersed and the us army cavalry charged and bombarded the veterans with tear gas88 this time first lady eleanor roosevelt visited the veterans at their muddy campsite listening to their concerns and singing army songs with them89 the meeting defused the tension between the veterans and the administration and one of the marchers later commented hoover sent the army roosevelt sent his wife90 also in 1933 after she became first lady a rose was discovered and named after eleanor with the name mrs franklin d roosevelt rosa x hybrida “mrs franklin d roosevelt”91 it is a hybrid tea rose91 however though this is true there is no evidence to support the story that eleanor later quipped i once had a rose named after me and i was very flattered but i was not pleased to read the description in the catalogue no good in a bed but fine up against a wall92 in 1937 she began writing her autobiography all volumes of which were compiled into the autobiography of eleanor roosevelt in 1961 harper brothers isbn 030680476x american youth congress and national youth administration the american youth congress was formed in 1935 to advocate for youth rights in us politics and was responsible for introducing the american youth bill of rights to the us congress roosevelts relationship with the ayc eventually led to the formation of the national youth administration a new deal agency in the united states founded in 1935 that focused on providing work and education for americans between the ages of 16 and 25939495 the nya was headed by aubrey willis williams a prominent liberal from alabama who was close to roosevelt and harry hopkins speaking of the nya in the 1930s roosevelt expressed her concern about ageism stating that i live in real terror when i think we may be losing this generation we have got to bring these young people into the active life of the community and make them feel that they are necessary96 in 1939 the dies committee subpoenaed leaders of the ayc who in addition to serving the ayc also were members of the young communist league roosevelt was in attendance at the hearings and afterward invited the subpoenaed witnesses to board at the white house during their stay in washington dc joseph p lash was one of her boarders on february 10 1940 members of the ayc as guests of roosevelt in her capacity as first lady attended a picnic on the white house lawn where they were addressed by franklin from the south portico the president admonished them to condemn not merely the nazi regime but all dictatorships97 the president was reportedly booed by the group afterwards many of the same youth picketed the white house as representatives of the american peace mobilization among them was joseph cadden one of roosevelts overnight boarders later in 1940 despite roosevelts publication of her reasons why i still believe in the youth congress the american youth congress was disbanded98 the nya was shut down in 194399 arthurdale roosevelts chief project during her husbands first two terms was the establishment of a planned community in arthurdale west virginia100101 on august 18 1933 at hickoks urging roosevelt visited the families of homeless miners in morgantown west virginia who had been blacklisted following union activities102 deeply affected by the visit roosevelt proposed a resettlement community for the miners at arthurdale where they could make a living by subsistence farming handicrafts and a local manufacturing plant101 she hoped the project could become a model for a new kind of community in the us in which workers would be better cared for103 her husband enthusiastically supported the project101 after an initial disastrous experiment with prefab houses construction began again in 1934 to roosevelts specifications this time with every modern convenience including indoor plumbing and central steam heat families occupied the first fifty homes in june and agreed to repay the government in thirty years time100104 though roosevelt had hoped for a racially mixed community the miners insisted on limiting membership to white christians after losing a community vote roosevelt recommended the creation of other communities for the excluded black and jewish miners105 the experience motivated roosevelt to become much more outspoken on the issue of racial discrimination106 roosevelt remained a vigorous fundraiser for the community for several years as well as spending most of her own income on the project107 however the project was criticized by both the political left and right conservatives condemned it as socialist and a communist plot while democratic members of congress opposed government competition with private enterprise108 secretary of the interior harold ickes also opposed the project citing its high perfamily cost109 arthurdale continued to sink as a government spending priority for the federal government until 1941 when the us sold off the last of its holdings in the community at a loss110 later commentators generally described the arthurdale experiment as a failure111 roosevelt herself was sharply discouraged by a 1940 visit in which she felt the town had become excessively dependent on outside assistance112 however the residents considered the town a utopia compared to their previous circumstances and many were returned to economic selfsufficiency110 roosevelt personally considered the project a success later speaking of the improvements she saw in peoples lives there and stating i dont know whether you think that is worth half a million dollars but i do111 civil rights activism roosevelt flying with tuskegee airman charles chief anderson in march 1941 during franklins administration eleanor became an important connection to the africanamerican population in the era of segregation despite the presidents desire to placate southern sentiment eleanor was vocal in her support of the civil rights movement after her experience with arthurdale and her inspections of new deal programs in southern states she concluded that new deal programs were discriminating against africanamericans who received a disproportionately small share of relief moneys eleanor became one of the only voices in the roosevelt white house insisting that benefits be equally extended to americans of all races113 eleanor also broke with tradition by inviting hundreds of africanamerican guests to the white house114 when the black singer marian anderson was denied the use of washingtons constitution hall by the daughters of the american revolution in 1939 eleanor resigned from the group in protest and helped arrange another concert on the steps of the lincoln memorial69 roosevelt later presented anderson to the king and queen of the united kingdom after anderson performed at a white house dinner115 roosevelt also arranged the appointment of africanamerican educator mary mcleod bethune with whom she had struck up a friendship as director of the division of negro affairs of the national youth administration116117 to avoid problems with the staff when bethune would visit the white house eleanor would meet her at the gate embrace her and walk in with her arminarm118 she was involved by being the eyes and the ears119 of the new deal she looked to the future and was committed to social reform one of those programs helped working women receive better wages the new deal also placed women into less machine work and more white collar work women did not have to work in the factories making war supplies because men were coming home so they could take over the long days and nights women had been working to contribute to the war efforts roosevelt brought unprecedented activism and ability to the role of the first lady120 roosevelt and mary mcleod bethune a member of franklin d roosevelts black cabinet 1943 in contrast to her usual support of africanamerican rights the sundown town eleanor in west virginia was named for her and was established in 1934 when she and franklin visited the county and developed it as a test site for families as a sundown town like other franklin roosevelt towns around the nation such as greenbelt greenhills greendale hanford or norris it was for whites only121 it was established as a new deal project122 eleanor lobbied behind the scenes for the 1934 costiganwagner bill to make lynching a federal crime including arranging a meeting between franklin and naacp president walter francis white123 fearing he would lose the votes of southern congressional delegations for his legislative agenda however franklin refused to publicly support the bill which proved unable to pass the senate124 in 1942 eleanor worked with activist pauli murray to persuade franklin to appeal on behalf of sharecropper odell waller convicted of killing a white farmer during a fight though franklin sent a letter to virginia governor colgate darden urging him to commute the sentence to life imprisonment waller was executed as scheduled125 roosevelts support of africanamerican rights made her an unpopular figure among whites in the south rumors spread of eleanor clubs formed by servants to oppose their employers and eleanor tuesdays on which africanamerican men would knock down white women on the street though no evidence has ever been found of either practice126 when race riots broke out in detroit in june 1943 critics in both the north and south wrote that roosevelt was to blame127 at the same time she grew so popular among africanamericans previously a reliable republican voting bloc that they became a consistent base of support for the democratic party128 following the japanese attack on pearl harbor on december 7 1941 roosevelt spoke out against japaneseamerican prejudice warning against the great hysteria against minority groups129 she also privately opposed her husbands executive order 9066 which required japaneseamericans in many areas of the us to enter internment camps130 she was widely criticized for her defense of japaneseamerican citizens including in a call by the los angeles times that she be forced to retire from public life over her stand on the issue131 norvelt on may 21 1937 roosevelt visited westmoreland homesteads to mark the arrival of the community’s final homesteader accompanying her on the trip was the wife of henry morgenthau jr the presidents secretary of the treasury132 i am no believer in paternalism i do not like charities she had said earlier but cooperative communities such as westmoreland homesteads she went on offered an alternative to our rather settled ideas that could provide equality of opportunity for all and prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster depression in the future residents were so taken by her personal expression of interest in the program that they promptly agreed to rename the community in her honor the new town name norvelt was a combination of the last syllables in her names eleanor roosevelt133 the norvelt firefighters hall is also named roosevelt hall in honor of her132 use of media eleanor roosevelt george t bye her literary agent upper right deems taylor upper left westbrook pegler lower left quaker lake pawling new york home of lowell thomas 1938 roosevelt was an unprecedentedly outspoken first lady who made far more use of the media than her predecessors she held 348 press conferences over the span of her husbands 12year presidency134 inspired by her relationship with hickok roosevelt placed a ban on male reporters attending the press conferences effectively forcing newspapers to keep female reporters on staff in order to cover them she relaxed the rule only once on her return from her 1943 pacific trip135 because the gridiron club banned women from its annual gridiron dinner for journalists roosevelt hosted a competing event for female reporters at the white house which she called gridiron widows 136 she was interviewed by many newspapers the new orleans journalist iris kelso described mrs roosevelt as her most interesting interviewee ever137 in the early days of her allfemale press conferences she said they would not address politics legislation or executive decision138 since the role of the first lady was expected to be nonpolitical at that time she also agreed at first that she would avoid discussing her views on pending congressional measures still the press conferences provided a welcome opportunity for the women reporters to speak directly with mrs roosevelt access that had been unavailable in previous administrations139 roosevelt with shirley temple in 1938 just before franklin assumed the presidency in february 1933 eleanor published an editorial in the womens daily news that conflicted so sharply with his intended public spending policies that he published a rejoinder in the following issue140 on entering the white house she signed a contract with the magazine womans home companion to provide a monthly column in which she answered mail sent to her by readers the feature was canceled in 1936 as another presidential election approached141 she continued her articles in other venues publishing more than sixty articles in national magazines during her tenure as first lady142 eleanor also began a syndicated newspaper column titled my day which appeared six days a week from 1936 to her death in 1962136 in the column she wrote about her daily activities but also her humanitarian concerns143 hickok and george t bye eleanors literary agent encouraged her to write the column144145 beasley has argued that roosevelts publications which often dealt with womens issues and invited reader responses represented a conscious attempt to use journalism to overcome social isolation for women by making public communication a twoway channel146 with lucille ball during a tour of washington dc hotels presenting fundraisers for the presidents birthday ball to fight infantile paralysis 1944 mrs roosevelt also made extensive use of radio she was not the first first lady to broadcast—her predecessor lou henry hoover had done that already but mrs hoover did not have a regular radio program whereas mrs roosevelt did she first broadcast her own programs of radio commentary beginning on july 9 1934147 on that first show she talked about the effect of movies on children the need for a censor who could make sure movies did not glorify crime and violence and her opinion about the recent allstar baseball game she also read a commercial from a mattress company which sponsored the broadcast she said she would not accept any salary for being on the air and that she would donate the amount 3000 to charity148 later that year in november 1934 she broadcast a series of programs about childrens education it was heard on the cbs radio network sponsored by a typewriter company mrs roosevelt once again donated the money giving it to the american friends service committee to help with a school it operated149 during 1934 eleanor roosevelt set a record for the most times a first lady had spoken on radio she spoke as a guest on other peoples programs as well as the host of her own for a total of 28 times that year150 in 1935 mrs roosevelt continued to host programs aimed at the female audience including one called its a womans world each time she donated the money she earned to charity151 the association of a sponsor with the popular first lady resulted in increases in sales for that company when the selby shoe company sponsored a series of eleanor roosevelts programs sales increased by 200152 the fact that her programs were sponsored created controversy with her husbands political enemies expressing skepticism about whether she really did donate her salary to charity they accused her of profiteering but her radio programs proved to be so popular with listeners that the criticisms had little effect153 she continued to broadcast throughout the 1930s sometimes on cbs and sometimes on nbc world war ii gen millard harmon eleanor roosevelt and admiral halsey in the south pacific theater 1943154 on may 10 1940 germany invaded belgium luxembourg and the netherlands marking the end of the relatively conflictfree phoney war phase of world war ii as the us began to move toward war footing roosevelt found herself again depressed fearing that her role in fighting for domestic justice would become extraneous in a nation focused on foreign affairs she briefly considered traveling to europe to work with the red cross but was dissuaded by presidential advisers who pointed out the consequences should the presidents wife be captured as a prisoner of war155 she soon found other wartime causes to work on however beginning with a popular movement to allow the immigration of european refugee children156 she also lobbied her husband to allow greater immigration of groups persecuted by the nazis including jews but fears of fifth columnists caused franklin to restrict immigration rather than expanding it157 eleanor successfully secured political refugee status for eightythree jewish refugees from the ss quanza in august 1940 but was refused on many other occasions158 her son james later wrote that her deepest regret at the end of her life was that she had not forced franklin to accept more refugees from nazism during the war159 roosevelt visiting troops eleanor was also active on the home front beginning in 1941 she cochaired the office of civilian defense ocd with new york city mayor fiorello h laguardia working to give civilian volunteers expanded roles in war preparations160 she soon found herself in a power struggle with laguardia who preferred to focus on narrower aspects of defense while she saw solutions to broader social problems as equally important to the war effort161 though laguardia resigned from the ocd in december 1941 eleanor was forced to resign following anger in the house of representatives over high salaries for several ocd appointments including two of her close friends162 also in 1941 the short film women in defense written by roosevelt was released it was produced by the office of emergency management and briefly outlines the way in which women could help prepare the country for the possibility of war there is also a segment on the types of costumes women would wear while engaged in war work at the end of the film the narrator explains women are vital to securing a healthy american home life and raising children which has always been the first line of defense in october 1942 roosevelt toured england visiting with american troops and inspecting british forces her visits drew enormous crowds and received almost unanimously favorable press in both england and america163 in august 1943 she visited american troops in the south pacific on a moralebuilding tour of which admiral william halsey jr later said she alone accomplished more good than any other person or any groups of civilians who had passed through my area164 for her part roosevelt was left shaken and deeply depressed by seeing the wars carnage165 a number of congressional republicans criticized her for using scarce wartime resources for her trip prompting franklin to suggest that she take a break from traveling166 play media eleanor roosevelt entertains soldiers as she tells a story september 1943 roosevelt supported increased roles for women and africanamericans in the war effort and began to advocate for women to be given factory jobs a year before it became a widespread practice167168 in 1942 she urged women of all social backgrounds to learn trades saying if i were of a debutante age i would go into a factory–any factory where i could learn a skill and be useful169 roosevelt learned of the high rate of absenteeism among working mothers and she campaigned for governmentsponsored day care170 she notably supported the tuskegee airmen in their successful effort to become the first black combat pilots visiting the tuskegee air corps advanced flying school in alabama she also flew with africanamerican chief civilian instructor c alfred chief anderson anderson had been flying since 1929 and was responsible for training thousands of rookie pilots he took her on a halfhour flight in a piper j3 cub171 after landing she cheerfully announced well you can fly all right172 the subsequent brouhaha over the first ladys flight had such an impact it is often mistakenly cited as the start of the civilian pilot training program at tuskegee even though the program was already five months old eleanor roosevelt did use her position as a trustee of the julius rosenwald fund to arrange a loan of 175000 to help finance the building of moton field172 after the war eleanor was a strong proponent of the morgenthau plan to deindustrialize germany in the postwar period173 in 1947 she attended the national conference on the german problem in new york which she had helped organize it issued a statement that any plans to resurrect the economic and political power of germany would be dangerous to international security174 years after the white house franklin died on april 12 1945 after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage at the little white house in warm springs georgia eleanor later learned that fdrs mistress lucy mercer rutherfurd had been with him when he died175 a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter anna had also been aware of the ongoing relationship between the president and rutherfurd176 it was anna who told her that franklin had been with lucy when he died in addition she told her that franklin had continued the relationship for decades and people surrounding him had hidden the information from eleanor after the funeral eleanor temporarily returned to valkill177 franklin left instructions for eleanor in the event of his death he proposed turning over hyde park to the federal government as a museum and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging for the transfer after fdrs death eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 washington square west in greenwich village in 1950 she rented suites at the park sheraton hotel 202 west 56th street she lived here until 1953 when she moved to

assembly on december 10 1948 the vote was unanimous with eight abstentions six soviet bloc countries as well as south africa and saudi arabia roosevelt attributed the abstention of the soviet bloc nations to article 13 which provided the right of citizens to leave their countries183 roosevelt also served as the first united states representative to the united nations commission on human rights184 and stayed on at that position until 1953 even after stepping down as chair of the commission in 1951185 the un posthumously awarded her one of its first human rights prizes in 1968 in recognition of her work186 roosevelt speaking at the united nations in july 1947 other postwar activities and honors in the late 1940s democrats in new york and throughout the country courted roosevelt for political office at first i was surprised that anyone should think that i would want to run for office or that i was fitted to hold office then i realized that some people felt that i must have learned something from my husband in all the years that he was in public life they also knew that i had stressed the fact that women should accept responsibility as citizens i heard that i was being offered the nomination for governor or for the united states senate in my own state and even for vice president and some particularly humorous souls wrote in and suggested that i run as the first woman president of the united states the simple truth is that i have had my fill of public life of the more or less stereotyped kind187 roosevelt with frank sinatra in 1960 catholics comprised a

for democratic voters a group dedicated to opposing desapios reincarnated tammany hall their efforts were eventually successful and desapio was forced to relinquish power in 1961193 despite her
