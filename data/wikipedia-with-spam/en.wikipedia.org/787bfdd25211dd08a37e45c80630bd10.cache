opportunity with a drive to the seattle 10yard line however on thirdandsix tom brady threw a pass that was intercepted by cornerback jeremy lane and returned to the 14yard line lane broke his wrist and tore his acl on the play when he tried to break his fall with his arm extended after being tackled by julian edelman and subsequently missed the rest of the game the game remained scoreless until new englands first drive of the second quarter which began with bradys 17yard completed pass to danny amendola brady later completed a 23yard pass to edelman on thirdandnine and eventually finished the drive with a 11yard touchdown pass to receiver brandon lafell seattle began to make progress when russell wilson completed his first pass of the day a sixyard completion to jermaine kearse on thirdandsix and with 536 left in the second quarter after a fiveyard run by marshawn lynch wilson completed a 44yard pass to receiver chris matthews on the patriots 11yard line setting up lynchs threeyard touchdown run to tie the game only 216 remained in the half after lynchs touchdown but the scoring was far from over brady completed 56 passes for 59 yards on new englands ensuing possession the last one a 22yard touchdown completion to tight end rob gronkowski with 31 seconds remaining taking the ball back on their own 20 seattle started off their drive with a 19yard burst from robert turbin and a 17yard scramble by wilson then wilson completed a 23yard pass to ricardo lockette with a facemask penalty on defensive back kyle arrington adding additional yardage that gave the team a first down on the patriots 11yard line only six seconds remained until halftime at this point but coach pete carroll decided to take a shot at the end zone rather than kick a field goal a gamble that paid off as wilson threw an 11yard touchdown pass to matthews on the next play tying the game at 14 with just two seconds showing on the clock75 second halfedit seattle took the second half kickoff and drove 72 yards to the patriots eightyard line featuring a 15yard run by lynch and a 45yard reception by matthews after lynch was stopped on thirdandone in the red zone steven hauschka finished the drive with a 27yard field goal giving seattle their first lead of the game at 17–1476 on new englands next possession linebacker bobby wagners interception of a brady pass and sixyard return gave the seahawks the ball at midfield just as with their last interception seattle lost a player for the game on the play due to injury this time defensive end cliff avril who departed with a concussion the offense was able to take advantage of the turnover driving 50 yards in six plays and scoring on wilsons threeyard touchdown pass to doug baldwin who was penalized 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct for an improper endzone celebration77 this made the score 24–14 and it would remain this way going into the fourth quarter until this game no team in super bowl history had come back to win after facing a fourthquarter deficit of more than seven points with 1210 left in the game new england mounted a 68yard drive to cut their deficit to 24–21 on bradys fouryard touchdown toss to amendola the drive included two 21yard completions from brady to edelman the first one converting a thirdand14 from the patriots 28yard line following a threeandout for seattle new england got the ball back on their own 32 at the 652 mark brady started off the possession with two completions to running back shane vereen for 13 total yards and followed it up with a nineyard pass to edelman following a penalty against new england gronkowski caught a pair of passes that moved the team up 33 yards to the seattle 19 over the next three plays vereen rushed for seven yards brady passed to lafell for seven more and blount ran the ball two yards to the threeyard line finally with 202 left in the game brady gave his team a 28–24 lead with a threeyard touchdown toss to edelman78 after a touchback gave seattle the ball on their 20 wilson started off the seahawks drive with a 31yard completion to lynch then after two incompletions he picked up another first down with an 11yard pass to lockette the following play gave seattle an opportunity to win the game wilson threw a deep pass down the right sideline to kearse who was covered by reserve rookie cornerback malcolm butler both players dove through the air for the ball and butler managed to deflect it with one hand but the pass fell right into the hands of kearse who tipped it to himself and caught the ball while he was lying on his back butler managed to recognize the catch and recover in time to shove kearse out of bounds as he got up preventing a seattle touchdown but the play netted 33 yards and gave the seahawks a first down at the patriots fiveyard line with 105 left in regulation announcer cris collinsworth compared the play to two other unusual receptions by patriots opponents that had defeated them in prior super bowls david tyrees helmet catch in super bowl xlii and mario manninghams sideline catch in super bowl xlvi al michaels also compared it to antonio freemans famous monday night football catch known as he did what a play that michaels had himself called on the next play lynch ran the ball four yards to the patriots oneyard line where he was brought down by donta hightower since new england did not call a timeout seattle was able to run the clock down to 26 seconds before taking the snap for the next play the seahawks called a pass play in which kearse would run a pick on the right side of the field to draw defensive backs away from lockette as lockette ran a slant to the middle but brandon browner blocked kearse at the line of scrimmage preventing him from reaching butler lockette appeared to be uncovered at the oneyard line when wilson threw him the ball but before the ball arrived butler correctly read the play and rushed into position to make the interception the turnover—after an unsportsmanlike conduct call for excessive celebration—gave new england the ball on their own oneyard line with 20 seconds remaining in regulation the game was not quite over at this point since the ball was placed on the oneyard line brady had to take the snap in the end zone if he took a knee or the patriots otherwise failed to advance the ball beyond the goal line this would be a safety awarding seattle two points and forcing the patriots to kick the ball back to the seahawks seattle would then have one time out and about 18 seconds to advance the ball into field goal range with the chance to win however the patriots took a time out then held the ball as the play clock ran in the attempt to draw a seattle defense player across the line of scrimmage had it run out the delay of game penalty would have merely moved the ball back half the distance to the goal the strategy worked defensive lineman michael bennett moved across the line of scrimmage earning a fiveyard encroachment penalty and moving the ball to the new england sixyard line brady then took a knee seattle called its final timeout and seattle linebacker bruce irvin rushed some of the patriots players

patriots in super bowl xxxix in a poll conducted by nflcom a couple of months after the game super bowl xlix was voted by its readers as the greatest super bowl game of all time84 the article does

of greatest super bowls continue to list it in the top few games85 reactions to seattles final playedit after the game seattle faced heavy criticism for their decision to call a pass play on second and goal from the 1yard line with 26 seconds and one timeout left instead of a rushing play following the play collinsworth stated im sorry but i cant believe the call … i cannot believe the call youve got marshawn lynch in the backfield youve got a guy that has been borderline unstoppable in this part of the field i cant believe the call he further added if i lose the super bowl because marshawn lynch can’t get it in from the 1 yard line so be it so be it but there is no way i don’t believe the call8687 sports illustrated writer peter king called the play one of the worst calls in super bowl history88 as did retired pro football hall of famer deion sanders89 retired running back emmitt smith the nfls alltime leading rusher went even further calling it the worst play call in the history of football90 others including university of michigan head coach jim harbaugh and hall of fame quarterback joe namath defended the call crediting butler for the play he made and pointing out that the seahawks only had one timeout left9192 writing for grantland bill simmons said the seahawks took too much heat for the final play call and noted carroll opted to run the ball on fourth down at the end of the 2006 rose bowl costing his team the game93 in the game lynch had gained at least one yard on 22 of 24 carries94 while the patriots in 2014 were ranked fifthworst 28th overall in the league in holding opposing backs for no gain or a loss they had stopped him for no gain on both a thirdand2 and a thirdand1 the latter in the red zone769495 on the season lynch had scored just once on his five attempts from his opponents 1yard line from 2010 to 2014 he scored 45 percent of the time ranking 30th out of 39 running backs for his career to that point he was successful on 42 percent of his attempts 15 of 36ab seattle offensive coordinator darrell bevell acknowledged making the call97 but also remarked that lockette could have been more aggressive on the play98 wilson said the play was a good call and lamented throwing the interception and not making that play97 carroll though said the last play was all my fault and called bevell crucially important to our future97 the head coach added that seattle would have run the ball on a subsequent play9799 as well that we dont ever call a play thinking we might throw an interception100 butlers interception was the only one against
