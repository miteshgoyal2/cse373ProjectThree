abrams baker began his political career in 1964 when he lost to the liberal democrat ross bass in a us senate election to fill the unexpired term of the late senator estes kefauver in the 1966 us senate election for tennessee bass lost the democratic primary to former governor frank g clement and baker handily won his republican primary race over kenneth roberts 112617 757 percent to 36043 242 percent5 baker won the general election capitalizing on clements failure to energize the democratic base including specifically organized labor he won by a somewhat largerthanexpected margin of 557 percent to clements 442 percent baker thus became the first republican senator from tennessee since reconstruction and the first republican to be popularly elected to the senate from tennessee harry w wellford then a private attorney but later a us district court justice and then us 6th circuit court of appeals justice served as bakers campaign chair and closest confidantcitation needed baker was reelected in 1972 and again in 1978 serving altogether from january 3 1967 to january 3 1985 in 1969 he was already a candidate for the minority leadership position that opened up with the death of his fatherinlaw everett dirksen but baker was defeated 19–24 by hugh scott6 at the beginning of the following congress in 1971 baker ran again losing to scott this time 20–247 president richard nixon asked baker in 1971 to fill one of the two empty seats on the us supreme court8 when baker took too long to decide whether he wanted the appointment nixon changed his mind and nominated william rehnquist instead9 in 197374 baker became the influential ranking minority member of the senate committee chaired by senator sam ervin that investigated the watergate scandal baker is famous for having asked aloud what did the president know and when did he know it the question is sometimes attributed to being given to him by his counsel and former campaign manager future us senator fred thompson10 john dean former counsel to nixon revealed to senate watergate chief counsel sam dash in executive session that baker had secret dealings with the white house during the congressional investigation though a juror in any future impeachment trial baker was recorded on february 22 1973 promising nixon im your friend im going to see that your interests are protected following this writes watergate reporter bob woodward both the majority democrats and minority republicans agreed to share all information ultimately one such document shared by nixon lawyer fred buzhardt inadvertently suggested the presence of nixons secret taping system11 when hugh scott retired baker was elected senate minority leader in 1977 by his republican colleagues defeating robert griffin 191812 baker served two terms as senate minority leader 1977–81 and two terms as senate majority leader 1981–85 baker was frequently mentioned by insiders as a possible nominee for vice president of the united states on a ticket headed by incumbent president gerald ford in 1976 according to many sources baker was a frontrunner for this post but then he disclosed that his wife joy was an alcoholic13 ford evidently concluding that one alcoholic spouse in the campaign—his wife betty for whom it would be necessary to stage an intervention in a few years—was sufficient chose kansas senator bob dole14 baker ran for us president in 1980 dropping out of the race for the republican nomination after losing the iowa caucuses to george hw bush and the new hampshire primary to ronald reagan even though a gallup poll had him in second place in the presidential race at eighteen percent behind reagan at 41 percent as late as november 197915 ted stevens served as acting minority leader during his primary campaign16 bakers support of the 1978 panama canal treaties was overwhelmingly unpopular especially among republicans117 and it cost him politically when he ran for president two years later it was a factor in reagans choosing george hw bush instead of baker as his running mate1 further activitiesedit baker did not seek reelection to the senate in 1984 he was succeeded by democratic congressman and future vice president al gore in 1984 baker received the presidential medal of freedomcitation needed as a testament to bakers skill as a negotiator and an honest and amiable broker reagan tapped him to serve as chief of staff during part of reagans second term 1987–1988 many saw this as a move by reagan to mend relations with the senate which had deteriorated somewhat under the previous chief of staff donald regancitation needed in accepting this appointment baker chose to skip another bid for the white house in 198818 in 2003 the howard h baker jr center
