professional ratings aggregate scores source rating metacritic 6710095 review scores source rating imdb 96 rotten tomatoes 97 rolling stone 98 the daily telegraph 99 roger ebert 100 the av club 101 the film received mostly positive reviews from film critics review aggregator rotten tomatoes reports that 80 of 162 critics have given the film a positive review with a rating average of 71 out of 10 the sites general consensus is that while it may not be the definitive concert film or the insightful backstage look some will hope for michael jacksons this is it packs more than enough entertainment value to live up to its ambitious title102 metacritic which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from film critics has a rating score of 67 based on 32 reviews103 roger ebert of the chicago sun times described the film as being an extraordinary documentary and stated that the film was nothing at all like what he was expecting to see104 ebert dismissed reports that jackson was in poor health and was underperforming stating that the film did not show a sick and drugged man forcing himself through grueling rehearsals but a spirit embodied by music and referred to jacksons rehearsal performances as having been something else104 kirt honeycutt of the hollywood reporter praised the film for being strange yet strangely beguiling for capturing jackson in feverish grips of pure creativity and stated that while the film presents that audience with a screen filled with everyone ranging from performers musicians choreographers crew members craftsmen she took notice that the film had primarily focused on jackson105106 honeycutt perceived based on what he had seen from the behindthescenes look of rehearsals that he understood what it takes to attain such dizzying heights in entertainment and that he understood why jackson chose to stay away from performing for a decade and based on what he saw from footage from rehearsals that it looks like the world has missed one helluva concert105106 honeycutt cited that the only thing that frustrated him more than knowing the tragedy that prevented the concert from happening was not knowing what youre looking at and commented that the film did not feel like a complete concert film because it had a grip on the audience stating where are jackson and his conspirators at any given moment in the creative process the film tries to be a concert film without having the actual footage so when everything comes to a halt audiences get thrown105106 peter travers of rolling stone described watching jacksons struggle as being illuminating unnerving and unforgettable and felt that the film was a great transcendent tribute to jackson because it did not have nor need a safety net107 more important however is that we rarely witness jackson giving 100 he frequently comments that he is saving his voice and body for the actual performances jackson certainly cant be faulted for this but its questionable whether he would really want his fans to see him thus dont get me wrong 60 of michael jackson is still a pretty good thing jackson the noted perfectionist at work correcting others dance moves without missing a beat himself and giving notes sometimes revelatory and other times inscrutable to his music director and others marjorie baumgarten of austin chronicle108 joshua rothkopf of time out new york referred to being a mustsee danceumentary109 rothkopf described jackson as obviously having been shooting for the moon right before his death based on what he could tell from the stunning bits of concert spectacle of phalanxes of computergenerated dancers tempo changes on a dime a bombshell of a blond guitarist who plays eddie van halens beat it solo flawlessly109 rothkopf stated that but the true value of this raw rehearsal footage is its emphasis less known on mjs laserlike attention to detail as he works his band and troupe up to speed a firm floor manager himself hes often exposed — and probably wouldnt have approved of this film one on one high school musicals kenny ortega meanwhile treats him with kid gloves i agree michael but to see him sweetly lose himself in human nature i like living this way is to feel a creature of the stage finally returned home and possibly on the cusp of redemption109 peter paras of e online felt that watching jackson and his performances in a positive aspect is the genius and the sadness of the entire film110 he did note that jacksons performance of earth song which consists of using jacksons voiceover to emphasize his environmental concerns while a bulldozer threatens to eat him was wellintentioned — because it brought attention to environmental concerns — but felt it was a little over the top110 paras felt the film showed an exacting and refreshingly funny side of jackson to be revealed and had jackson lived we never would have seen those moments and felt the film was a proper way to finally say goodbye to jackson110 marjorie baumgarten of austin chronicle referred to the film as being neither a true concert film nor a strict behindthescenes documentary this is it is like jackson himself a real hybrid and felt that while the films made up of lots of grainy footage which ortega has edited together seamlessly it will also provide a fitting farewell108 baumgarten noted that the finished film is a fairly complete concert runthrough with each song edited and that while the film will easily show that it was made for a profit that the audience will see a film to be a fitting elegy108 joe morgenstern of the wall street journal felt the film was expertly packaged—brilliantly packaged and noted that the film quite convincingly had emphasized that jackson had enough energy to perform even with his wraiththin body111 ann powers of los angeles times said that while the film offers only a few such insights into jacksons artistic process though enough surface to make this a useful document as well as a beautiful one that the film is a piece with jacksons body of work dazzling and strange blurring the line between fantasy and reality112 she described ortegas editing to make the film feel like a real concert film as being almost too good to believe112 powers praised the film for showing intimate views of jackson like his vulnerable moments during performances and felt the film was made to honor not just the memory of jackson but the hard work of a big cast and crew that never made it to opening night which she felt mostly is a tribute to the power of jacksons body and voice112 powers stated she had felt the film was such a tragic teaser for the shows that might have been this is it hurts if jackson had been able to perform as he frequently does during these scenes he would have accomplished the comeback for which he was so hungry112 she noted that jacksons total lack of engagement with the cameras adds to the unreal mood because he was always performing — but for the imagined masses not for the filmgoer and that the film does not entirely acknowledge that reality and thats a little odd112 we see jackson as a perfectionist a generous boss a tough taskmaster and a playful child off guard and probably unaware that it would ever be seen by the public we find jackson pushing his band and production team to the limit with demands to let it sizzle and make the music simmer obsessive jacko fans may be shocked by his divaish behaviour as he complains about earpieces but its heartening to finally view the late singer as a rounded human with regular failings and imperfections similarly a scene featuring jackson screaming weeeee with childish glee as he moves around the stage on a giant cherrypicker will surely bring a smile to even the most cynical viewer alex fletcher of digital spy113 lou lumenick of the new york post strongly criticized both the film and jacksons performances lumenicks criticism of jacksons performances was he felt jackson moves stiffly and lethargically and that it was clear that jackson was lipsynching while performing thriller114 he felt jacksons performance of smooth criminal looked incongruous to say the least and that the hokey environmental visuals accompanying earth song are even worse and cited beat it as being the movies only halfdecent number114 lumenick said that he was certain that a perfectionist like jackson would not want to have been remembered by a shoddy piece of exploitation114 david edwards of daily mirror stated that while he felt that the film is a success he overall disliked the film having felt that as an exercise in wringing every last penny from jacksons legacy the film most certainly isnt it a tribute115 alex fletcher of digital spy described the film as having been an essential viewing and praised the film for showing the real michael jackson — which consisted of difficult odd kind obsessive and funny he cited jacksons best performances as thriller and billie jean and the worst material as earth song113 however fletcher did feel that while based on the rehearsal footage jackson falls short of his groundbreaking dangerous and bad world tours he noted that jacksons age and thinness was mostly likely a factor in his performances and described jackson as having more star quality and charisma than a million simon cowell factoryline production pop singers113 home mediaedit this is it
