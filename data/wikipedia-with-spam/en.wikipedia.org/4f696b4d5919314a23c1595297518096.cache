in the revised code of washington rcw these routes are defined generally by termini and points along the route wsdot may otherwise choose the details and may bypass the designated points as long as the road serves the general vicinity456 wsdots duties include locating designing constructing improving repairing operating and maintaining these state highways including bridges and other related structures7 within cities and towns the local governments are responsible for certain aspects of the streets maintained as parts of a state highway including their grade and the portion not used for highway purposes8 all routes even interstate and us highways are defined as state route number plus the number for instance interstate 5 is state route number 5 and us route 395 is state route number

spur are defined as part of the main routes as is us route 101 alternate12 wsdot has also defined some spurs that mainly serve to provide full access between intersecting routesa although most state highways as defined by law are open to traffic state route 109 deadends at taholah state route 501 has a gap in the middle and state routes 35 168 230 276 and most of sr 171 213 and 704 have not been

floating bridges the evergreen point bridge hood canal bridge and lake washington bridge the washington state ferries except the route to sidney british columbia were legally included in the state highway system in 1994 a new state route 339 was created at that time for the passengeronly seattlevashon ferry11 according to the washington state department of licensing ocean beaches are legally state highways with a general speed limit of 25 mph 40 kmh many only open to vehicles between the day after labor day and april 1412 but state law places the beaches under the control of the washington state parks and recreation commission and only designates them as public highways131415 most state routes are numbered in a grid with evennumbered routes running east–west and oddnumbered routes running north–southb even twodigit routes increase from south to north in three strips with sr 4 sr 6 and sr 8 in the western part of the state sr 14 sr 16 sr 18 and sr 20 along the interstate

following this general progression sr 19 was added in 1991 and lies west of sr 3 sr 35 and sr 41 are extensions of highways in adjacent states threedigit routes and sr 92 and sr 96 are usually numbered by taking the first one or two digits of a route it connects to and adding another digit or two in some cases instead of using the twodigit routes actual number a number that would fit the

history of washingtons state highway system washingtons first connected state highway system 1913 after passing several early laws designating state roads starting in 1893 the washington state legislature created the state highway board in 1905 and appropriated funds to construct but not maintain twelve numbered state roads in sparsely settled areas of the state main highways in more populated areas would continue to be entirely under county control though sometimes built with 50 state aid six of these highways were east–west crossings of the cascades others included a portion of chuckanut drive and a road around the west side of the olympic peninsula16 under a 1909 law the state highway board surveyed a connected network of proposed state roads17 the legislature added most of these routes to the state highway system in 1913 when they formed a twotiered system of primary and secondary roads primary roads were completely controlled by the state including maintenance and received only names while secondary roads kept their numbers and county maintenance unlike the earlier state roads these primary roads mostly followed existing passable county roads181920 a 1923 restructuring of the system reassigned numbers to almost all the primary state highways21 which were soon marked on signscitation needed in 1937 the old primarysecondary split was abolished and a new system of primary and secondary state highways was created all to be maintained by the state in the same manner the old state roads all kept their numbers as new primary state highways and secondary state highways were created as alphanumeric branches of those primary highways for instance ssh 8d was a branch of psh 82223 the final renumbering2425 was authorized by law in 1963 and posted in january 1964 when new sign route numbers were assigned that matched the interstate systems and otherwise formed the present grid until 1970 these numbers coexisted with the older primary and secondary state highways when the legislature adopted the sign route numbers as state routescitation needed finally eliminating all vestiges of the 1905 numberingc see alsoedit washington roads portal notesedit the only ones listed in the 2006 log that do not provide such missing movements are sr 9 spur to the truck customs in sumas and sr 504 spur and sr 906 spur to wsdot maintenance areas only sr 501 sr 523 sr 531 and sr 548 run in a perpendicular direction for example sr 4 from 1905 kept its number as psh 4 until 1970 referencesedit a b c staff rcw 4717 state highway routes revised code of
