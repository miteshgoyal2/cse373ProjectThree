the download revolution by making legal services attractive for users even legal music downloads have faced a number of challenges from artists record labels and the recording industry association of america in july 2007 the universal music group decided not to renew their longterm contracts with itunes this decision was primarily based upon the issue of pricing of songs as universal wanted to be able to charge more or less depending on the artist a shift away from itunes standard—at the time—99 cents per song pricing many industry leaders feel that this is only the first of many showdowns between apple inc and the various record labels3 music downloads offered by artistsedit some artists allow downloading their songs from their websites or an online music store often as a short preview or lowquality sample as an example itunes allows listening to a short preview of any song to listen to it before buying this replaces listening to music in a store before purchase others embed
