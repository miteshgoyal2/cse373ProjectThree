greatest hits album from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search greatest hits and best of redirect here for a list of greatest hits albums see list of greatest hits albums for other uses see greatest hits disambiguation a greatest hits album sometimes called a best of album or a catalog album is a compilation of songs by a particular artist or band most often the track list contains previously released recordings with a high degree of notability however to increase the appeal especially to people who already own the original release it is common to include remixes or alternate takes of popular songs sometimes even new material previously unreleased will function as bonus tracks at times a greatest hits compilation is the original album release for songs that have themselves been released as a single and charted successfully many of these albums surface despite the unwillingness of original artists to support them the songwriters being embroiled in fighting record company decisions despite the rolling stones conflicts over the control of their tracks the bandopposed hot rocks 1964–1971 surfaced in december 1971 and the contentious legal issues failed to clip the wings of the records commercial success1 nonetheless many other of these albums actually receive detailed cooperation from the musicians involved which can mean trying to present a specific goal or sound in the work roughly akin to that in concept albums one example of the latter is the us band dream theaters release greatest hit and 21 other pretty cool songs which came out on rhino records on april 1 2008 the tongueincheek title notes how the song pull me under has such outsize knowledge compared to the rest of the bands discography2 contents 1 notable compilations 2 criticism and popularity 3 gaming and television 4 see also 5 references notable compilationsedit madonnas the immaculate collection 1990 is the best selling greatest hits compilation by a solo artist all of the songs on it are presented in different versions than the original hit versions3 the eagles their greatest hits 1971–1975 1976 is the best selling greatest hits compilation by a group and also one of the ten best selling albums in history greatest hits albums are typically produced after an artist has had enough successful songs to fill out an album release some artists such as selena david bowie cliff richard mariah carey aaliyah madonna janet jackson britney spears elvis presley michael jackson the beatles kenny rogers aerosmith kiss tlc dolly parton journey los tigres del norte queen kylie minogue and billy joel have released multiple greatest hits albums through their long careers some greatest hits albums are released only at the end of the artist or groups career for example my chemical romance released a greatest hits album may death never stop you the greatest hits 2001–2013 in 2014 after they disbanded other artists like eminem have released hits albums in the center of their success he released curtain call the hits in 2005 and then shady xv as a compilation album in 2014 some bands refuse to release a greatest hits album notably acdc tool and metallica acdc however has released two compilation albums in the past in 1986 who made who and in 2010 iron man 2 which are both movie soundtracks manic street preachers initially refused to do a greatest hits but in the end forever delayed was released in 2002 a later release national treasures the complete singles 2011 was selected and endorsed by the band radiohead also refused to do such a compilation but upon their departure from parlophone records radiohead the best of was released in 2008 without their cooperation4 this was initially to be the case with oasis but upon realization that the release was inevitable the band took direct involvement with the album titled stop the clocks 2006 and selected the track listing track order artwork and title oasis later endorsed a second collection time flies 1994–2009 2010 although as a singles collection they had less control over its contents the country music star garth brooks long opposed the release of a greatest hits collection but agreed to it in 19945 but only for a limited time6 his release the hits was quickly deleted but not until selling well over ten million copies canadian singersongwriter joni mitchell known for her eclectic interest in different musical styles also resisted releasing a greatest hits album for many years reportedly fearing that the availability of a greatest hits compilation would lead her record label to take her actual studio albums out of print she agreed to release hits in 1996 along with a second album titled misses which came out that same year and the latter compiled nonhit songs that mitchell personally selected as being representative of her work mitchells assumptions proved correct as both releases earned mixed to positive critical reviews one of the most notorious examples of a greatest hits compilation released against the artists intentions is uk rock group the rolling stones compilation hot rocks 1964–1971 1971 the music magazine rolling stone remarked that the album served as a beautifully packaged purely mercenary item put together by the stones former record company to cash in on the christmas season and wring some more bucks out in the name of the mod princes they once owned1 after their manager tricked the band into signing over the copyrights to their 19631970 song catalog the band did succeed in changing management and record labels however they could neither prevent the release of hot rocks nor its successor which was titled more hot rocks big hits fazed cookies 1972 a testament to the selling power of greatest hits albums hot rocks remains the best selling album of the rolling stones career note that mick jagger and keith richards continue to collect significant songwriting royalties from the hot rocks sales but not the ownership royalties greatest hits collections can also boost a falling music career the beautiful souths first greatest hits album carry on up the charts 1994 was originally strongly opposed by the band however upon release it became one of the fastest selling albums in chart history7 often a greatest hits vhs or dvd collection can be released which features the music videos to the hits these are often released concurrently with a greatest hits album a more recent example being the oasis release time flies 1994–2009 however sometimes a greatest hits vhs or dvd can be released as a solo release without a companion album a good example being the guns n roses vhsdvd welcome to the videos released in 1998 guns n roses would eventually release a greatest hits album in 2004 another example of a video greatest hits without a companion audio album would be positive mental octopus by the red hot chili peppers released in 1990 however in 1992 the band released a video called what hits which contained all the videos from positive mental octopus 1990 and also had an accompanying album occasionally a dvd release will feature music videos for singles that were not included on the greatest hits album whilst the greatest hits album might only contain a small number of singles a dvd release will often contain all the bands music videos up until that point two examples of this are blurs the best of dvd 2000 and jamiroquais high times singles 1992–2006 2006 queen have released greatest video hits 1 2002 and greatest video hits 2 2003 several bands that have experienced highly varied chart success such as being labeled one hit wonders or two hit wonders have released albums using comedic titles including things such as puns in reference to that fact in their best of albums two examples are men without hats a canadian new wave group who released greatest hats 1996 as well as the michael stanley band a us rock n roll group who released greatest hints 1979 notably the us progressive rock band dream theater directly poked fun at itself with the release greatest hit and 21 other pretty cool songs 2008 which came out on rhino records on april 1 2008 the album referred openly to how their single pull me under has such outsize knowledge compared to the rest of the bands discography2 some radio stations are emerging that only play greatest hits albums as their source material8 criticism and popularityedit another criticism has been including one or two new songs with a package of hits this trend started in the early 1980s and made it necessary for collectors to purchase the greatest hits album if they wished to have the complete catalog of an artists songs even if those collectors owned all the albums containing the preexisting hits by contract another solution to acquire only the songs via an online music store may also be restricted to purchase of the album only even online for example in 2002 the paperboys released tenure which out of its eighteen tracks contains six new songs the quality of a greatest hits package released early in an artists career depends upon the artist elvis presley released elvis golden records in 1958 which only covered 1956–1958 although this album still sells today remaining in print on compact disc despite the many presley hits collections issued since the bee gees released best of bee gees in 1969 only two years after their international debut yet nine of the twelve tracks were hit singles in america sly and the family stone released their greatest hits album in 1970 after only three years ringo starrs blast from your past and john lennons shaved fish came out in 1975 after fiveyear solo careers both had been in the beatles though none of that material was featured on either album zz tops greatest hits was released in 1978 as a contractual obligation with no new tracks but since its cd release has been popular because of its use of the original mixes of songs the cd releases of their parent albums have overdubs made in the 1980s all of these compilations were well received and continue to garner critical kudos9101112 bob marleys legend 1984 remains his best selling album despite having many more posthumous hits since and more thorough compilations being released later on in japan it is common for artists to have greatest hits compilations released early in their career many acts release a compilation after three albums which commonly means after only three years of career in the music market ayumi hamasaki mai kuraki hikaru utada glay and greeeen are a few examples the band mcfly from england also released a greatest hits album after three albums and three active years many times the decision of having a greatest hits released is due to the popularity of the artist at the moment which results in bigger sales it is also common for the japanese artists to have many compilations throughout their careers gaming and televisionedit a recent trend is for television shows to release compilation dvds of their most wellregarded and highestrated episodes to drive new viewers to watch a program two examples of this are family guys freakin sweet collection and south park the hits several video game companies have game rereleases after they have sold a certain number sonys playstation has a greatest hits banner nintendo has the nintendo selects label formerly players choice and microsoft has the xbox platinum hits label the european title and original north american title for guitar hero smash hits was guitar hero greatest hits see alsoedit grandes éxitos disambiguation the spanish
