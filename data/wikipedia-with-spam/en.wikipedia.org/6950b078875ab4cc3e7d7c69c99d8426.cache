controlled position rotations of the rod after striking the ball are permitted generally shots short of a full 360degree rotation before or after striking the ball are legal since the establishment of the itsf the rules have become standardised in most international competitions however since january 2012 the annual world championships and the world cup will permit two full 360degree rotations4 the
