a presidential nominating convention held at the exposition hall in chicago illinois on june 3–6 18841 it resulted in the nomination of former house speaker james g blaine from maine for president and senator john a logan of illinois for vice president the ticket lost in the election of 1884 to democrats grover cleveland and thomas a hendricks in attendance were 1600 delegates and alternates and 6000 spectators1 there were 820 official delegates 411 votes were needed to win the nomination2 the incumbent president chester arthur was not a serious contender due to ill health blaine was the favorite going in but there was a possibility that president arthur could build a coalition with smaller candidates such as george f edmunds1 there were also rumors that members of the party would bolt if blaine won the nomination3 neither blaine nor arthur were in attendance blaine was at his home in augusta maine and arthur followed the events from the white house by telegraphy4 to test the waters blaine supporters nominated powell clayton as temporary chair of the convention a former arthur supporter clayton was now in blaines camp he was popular with veterans but was also associated with the star route frauds edmunds supporters led by henry c lodge moved to nominate john r lynch instead an africanamerican from mississippi the speech supporting lynch was given by theodore roosevelt lynch won the vote 424 to 384 and blaines nomination seemed for the first time vulnerable1 blaines future seemed more vulnerable the next day when to address the rumors of party members bolting his supporters made a motion to remove seats of delegates who failed to pledge support of the eventual nominee the motion failed again by the fortitude of edmunds supporters3 the day closed with john b henderson being elected permanent chair of the convention3 that evening leaders of arthurs and edmunds camps met in private in the grand pacific hotel and tried to create a viable coalition arthurs team could not guarantee that his supporters would back edmunds it was more likely that the second choice of arthur delegates was blaine3 the roll call of the states began the next evening when maine blaines state was called the cheering lasted ten minutes during which time william h west came to the platform and gave a rabblerousing speech to second the nomination after wests speech pandemonium continued in the building much to wests chagrin5 further speeches seconding the nomination were given by cushman kellogg davis and thomas c platt6 when the roll call reached new york it was arthurs turn to be nominated martin i townsends speech was lackluster at best and poorly prepared townsend having been selected for the responsibility only after the roll call began his speech was occasionally drowned out by hisses and eruptions of side conversations6 the nomination was seconded by harry h bingham john r lynch and patrick h winston binghams speech was strong lynchs brief and winstons irritating although it was already 11 pm a motion to adjourn failed another speech for arthur was given by p b s pinchback but like the others it did not sway any support7 to close the night joseph b foraker nominated john sherman and john davis long nominated edmunds the delegates adjourned just after midnight2 the next morning june 6 the balloting began on the first ballot blaine received 344½ arthur 278 edmunds 93 logan 63½ sherman 30 with joseph roswell hawley robert todd lincoln and william tecumseh sherman receiving parts of the remainder arthur received only a third of his votes from the north none from ohio 1 of 44 from illinois 9 of 30 from indiana 11 of 60 from pennsylvania and only 31 of 71 from his home state of new york it was expected that logans delegates would shift to blaine on the second ballot blaine received 375 gaining delegates from edmunds arthur 274 on the fourth ballot blaine received 541 arthur 207 and edmunds 41 blaine received 130 more than the majority needed grabbing 67 from arthurs camp and 28 from edmunds that evening logan was selected to be blaines running mate3 as of 2017 this was the last convention where an incumbent president was refused renomination republican candidates speaker james g blaine of maine president chester a arthur of new york senator george f edmunds of vermont senator john a logan of
