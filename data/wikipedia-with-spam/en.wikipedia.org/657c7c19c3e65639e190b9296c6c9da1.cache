representation by the communications workers of americatu136 on september 25 2013 metropcs workers in harlem ny voted for a union voice and representation by cwatu137 2009 coordinated organizing effortedit cwa president larry cohen and a disguised unidentified tmobile usa employee pictured at a 2009 press conference announcing a coordinated unionizing effort in 2008 the cwa and verdi launched a coordinated effort to unionize company employees a spokesman for the cwa called on the company to stop resisting mobilization efforts and allow company employees to unionize as german employees of tmobile usas parent company dt have done in response the company released an employee satisfaction study showing that more than seventy percent of the companys 40000 workers were very satisfied with their jobs through a spokesman the company stated despite the communication workers of americas periodic organizing efforts for more than nine years no group of tmobile employees has ever chosen to be represented by a union while our company is always striving to find ways to improve year after year employees continue to view tmobile as a good place to work where they have no need for or interest in a union136 political pressureedit in 2009 a number of politicians in one case acting after lobbying efforts by cwa union activists wrote letters to rené obermann dts chief executive officer in an effort to influence tmobile usas labor practices in the us138 in a march 13 2009 letter us senator john kerry dma asked why the companys approach to labor rights are different in germany than in the united states in an april 30 2010 letter sent after lobbying by communications workers of america activists 26 democratic members of congress called on dt to protect and respect workers rights in the

published in 2009 by american rights at work on december 9 2009 the nonprofit organization american rights at work published a report written by prof john logan director of labor studies at san francisco state university titled lowering the bar or setting the standard deutsche telekoms us labor practices the report details behavior by the company that the author perceives as antiunion including dissemination of antiunion materials intimidation and threats directed at prounion workers captive audience meetings and the retention of antiunion specialists142 in the report which is based on documents from the national labor relations board internal company memos and handbooks and interviews with workers logan asserts that the company engaged in a systematic campaign to prevent employees from forming a union and that dt was guilty of operating by a double standard he claims that deutsche telekom respects workers rights in germany where it cooperates closely with unions but mistreats workers in the united states and interferes with their right to organizeclarification needed143 on september 2 2010 human rights watch released a report written by lance compa titled a strange case violations of workers freedom of association in the united states by european multinational corporations the report concludes that company policy has translated into practices that leave the workforce fearful about even seeking union representation144 dt proclaims its adherence to international labor law and standards that are embodied in german domestic laws but hrw found that tmobile usas harsh opposition to workers freedom of association in the united states betrays deutsche telekoms purported commitment to social responsibility impedes constructive dialogue with employee representatives and in several cases has violated ilo and oecd labor and human rights standards145 workplace activitiesedit at the companys allentown pennsylvania call center security guards were ordered by company managers to write up incident reports whenever union supporters appeared on nearby public grounds and to record the license plate numbers of employees who stopped to take leaflets in 2006 the national labor relations board found that these activities violated section 8a1 of the national labor relations act146 in 2008 company management in the pacific northwest and southwest retail divisions sent a memorandum to store managers instructing them to immediately report any union activity to their supervisors147 human rights watch states the nlrb has long held that such activity interferes with restrains and coerces employees in the exercise of section 7 rights in violation of workers right to freedom of association148 information securityedit nicolas jacobsen was charged with intruding into the companys internal network in january 2005149 reports indicated that for about a year jacobsen had access to customer passwords email address books social security numbers birth dates and sidekick photos affected customers included members of the united states secret service secret service informant identified jacobsen as part of operation firewall which provided evidence that jacobsen had attempted to sell customer information to others for identity theft tmobile usa and the secret service did not elaborate on the methods jacobsen used to gain access but sources close to the case indicated that jacobsen exploited an unpatched flaw in the oracle weblogic server application software used by the company150 additional sql injection vulnerabilities with the companys web site were reported by jack koziol of the infosec institute151 tmobile offers access to voice mail without the input of a password by default parties acting in bad faith may be able to access such voice mailboxes via caller id spoofing to avoid this possibility tmobile recommends that all customers password protect their mailboxes but still offers the no password configuration by default due to customer demand152 on june 6 2009 a message posted from an email account pwnmobileatsafemailnet to the full disclosure mailing list claimed that the companys network had been breached and showed sample data the sender offered databases confidential documents scripts and programs from their servers financial documents up to 2009 to the highest bidder153154 on june 9 the company issued a statement confirming the breach but stating that customer data was safe it claimed to have identified the source document for the sample data and believe it was not obtained by hacking155 a later statement claimed that there was not any evidence of a breach156 privacy and surveillanceedit tmobile usa received a portion of the 13 million largely warrantless law enforcement requests for subscriber information including text messages and phone location data made in 2011 but refused to state how many requests it received157 it did say that in the last decade the number of requests have increased by 12 to 16 percent annually158 data retention policiesedit according to tmobiles privacy policy highlights retention and disposal information is retained for as long as there is business or tax need or as applicable laws regulations or government orders require tmobile notes that it disposes of personal information uses reasonable procedures designed to erase or render it unreadable for example shredding documents and wiping electronic media159 in 2010 the department of justice doj released a document entitled retention periods of major cellular providers to advise law enforcement agents seeking to obtain cell phone records this document was uncovered by the aclus coordinated records request on cell phone location tracking by police notably the document showed that tmobile subscriber information was retained for 5 years and call detail records were kept for 2 years prepaid and 5 years postpaid160 in 2013 massachusetts sen edward markey revealed responses from the top four us wireless providers as well as us cellular c spire and cricketleap wireless to his inquiry regarding user information disclosed to law enforcement officials the following was tmobiles response regarding data retention tmobile us retains customers historic cell site information and cell tower dump information 180 days call details records 7–10 years text message content data requests and geolocation data not stored voicemail content up to 21 days subscriber information 6 years after account is closed161 comparing the 2010 doj memo released by the aclu and massachusetts senator edward markeys 2013 wireless data retention disclosures it should be noted that tmobile increased the retention period for subscriber information from 5 years to 6 years tmobile also increased its call detail record retention from 2 years prepaid and 5 years postpaid to 7–10 years see alsoedit companies portal telecommunication portal washington portal list of companies based in bellevue
