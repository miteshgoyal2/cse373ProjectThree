english mathematician educator philosopher and logician he worked in the fields of differential equations and algebraic logic and is best known as the author of the laws of thought 1854 which contains boolean algebra boolean logic is credited with laying the foundations for the information age3 boole maintained that no general method for the solution of questions in the theory of probabilities can be established which does not explicitly recognise not only the special numerical bases of the science but also those universal laws of thought which are the basis of all reasoning and which whatever they may be as to their essence are at least mathematical as to their form4 contents 1 early life 2 professor at cork 3 honours and awards 4 works 41 differential equations 42 analysis 43 symbolic

son of john boole sr 1779–1848 a shoemaker5 and mary ann joyce6 he had a primary school education and received lessons from his father but due to a serious decline in business he had little further formal and academic teaching7 william brooke a bookseller in lincoln may have helped him with latin which he may also have learned at the school of thomas bainbridge he was selftaught in modern languages2 in fact when a local newspaper printed his translation of a latin poem a scholar accused him of plagiarism under the pretense that he was not capable of such achievements8 at age 16 boole became the breadwinner for his parents and three younger siblings taking up a junior teaching position in doncaster at heighams school9 he taught briefly in liverpool1 greyfriars lincoln which housed the mechanics institute boole participated in the mechanics institute in the greyfriars lincoln which was founded in 1833210 edward bromhead who knew john boole through the institution helped george boole with mathematics books11 and he was given the calculus text of sylvestre françois lacroix by the rev george stevens dickson of st swithins lincoln12 without a teacher it took him many years to master calculus1 at age 19 boole successfully established his own school in lincoln four years later he took over halls academy in waddington outside lincoln following the death of robert hall in 1840 he moved back to lincoln where he ran a boarding school1 boole immediately became involved in the lincoln topographical society serving as a member of the committee and presenting a paper entitled on the origin progress and tendencies polytheism especially amongst the ancient egyptians and persians and in modern india 13 on 30 november 1841 boole became a prominent local figure an admirer of john kaye the bishop14 he took part in the local campaign for early closing2 with e r larken and others he set up a building society in 184715 he associated also with the chartist thomas cooper whose wife was a relation16 plaque from the house in lincoln from 1838 onwards boole was making contacts with sympathetic british academic mathematicians and reading more widely he studied algebra in the form of symbolic methods as far as these were understood at the time and began to publish research papers1 professor at corkedit the house at 5 grenville place in cork in which boole lived between 1849 and 1855 and where he wrote the laws of thought booles status as mathematician was recognised by his appointment in 1849 as the first professor of mathematics at queens college cork now university college cork ucc in ireland he met his future wife mary everest there in 1850 while she was visiting her uncle john ryall who was professor of greek they married some years later in 185517 he maintained his ties with lincoln working there with e r larken in a campaign to reduce prostitution18 honours and awardsedit boole was awarded the keith medal by the royal society of edinburgh in 1855 19 and was elected a fellow of the royal society frs in 185712 he received honorary degrees of lld from the university of dublin and the university of oxford20 booles gravestone in blackrock cork ireland detail of stained glass window in lincoln cathedral dedicated to boole plaque beneath booles window in lincoln cathedral worksedit booles first published paper was researches in the theory of analytical transformations with a special application to the reduction of the general equation of the second order printed in the cambridge mathematical journal in february 1840 volume 2 no 8 pp 64–73 and it led to a friendship between boole and duncan farquharson gregory the editor of the journal his works are in about 50 articles and a few separate publications21 in 1841 boole published an influential paper in early invariant theory12 he received a medal from the royal society for his memoir of 1844 on a general method of analysis it was a contribution to the theory of linear differential equations moving from the case of constant coefficients on which he had already published to variable coefficients22 the innovation in operational methods is to admit that operations may not commute23 in 1847 boole published the mathematical analysis of logic the first of his works on symbolic logic24 differential equationsedit boole completed two systematic treatises on mathematical subjects during his lifetime the treatise on differential equations25 appeared in 1859 and was followed the next year by a treatise on the calculus of finite differences26 a sequel to the former work analysisedit in 1857 boole published the treatise on the comparison of transcendents with certain applications to the theory of definite integrals27 in which he studied the sum of residues of a rational function among other results he proved what is now called booles identity m e s x ∈ r ∣ ℜ 1 π ∑ a k x − b k ≥ t ∑ a k π t displaystyle mathrm mes leftxin mathbb r mid re frac 1pi sum frac akxbkgeq trightfrac sum akpi t for any real numbers ak  0 bk and t  028 generalisations of this identity play an important role in the theory of the hilbert transform28 symbolic logicedit main article boolean algebra in 1847 boole published the pamphlet mathematical analysis of logic he later regarded it as a flawed exposition of his logical system and wanted an investigation of the laws of thought on which are founded the mathematical theories of logic and probabilities to be seen as the mature statement of his views contrary to widespread belief boole never intended to criticise or disagree with the main principles of aristotles logic rather he intended to systematise it to provide it with a foundation and to extend its range of applicability29 booles initial involvement in logic was prompted by a current debate on quantification between sir william hamilton who supported the theory of quantification of the predicate and booles supporter augustus de morgan who advanced a version of de morgan duality as it is now called booles approach was ultimately much further reaching than either sides in the controversy30 it founded what was first known as the algebra of logic tradition31 among his many innovations is his principle of wholistic reference which was later and probably independently adopted by gottlob frege and by logicians who subscribe to standard firstorder logic a 2003 article32 provides a systematic comparison and critical evaluation of aristotelian logic and boolean logic it also reveals the centrality of wholistic reference in booles philosophy of logic 1854 definition of universe of discourseedit in every discourse whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts or of the individual in his intercourse with others there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined the most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application and for them the limits of discourse are coextensive with those of the universe itself but more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field sometimes in discoursing of men we imply without expressing the limitation that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak as of civilised men or of men in the vigour of life or of men under some other condition or relation now whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse furthermore this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse33 treatment of addition in logicedit boole conceived of elective symbols of his kind as an algebraic structure but this general concept was not available to him he did not have the segregation standard in abstract algebra of postulated axiomatic properties of operations and deduced properties34 his work was a beginning to the algebra of sets again not a concept available to boole as a familiar model his pioneering efforts encountered specific difficulties and the treatment of addition was an obvious difficulty in the early days boole replaced the operation of multiplication by the word and and addition by the word or but in booles original system was a partial operation in the language of set theory it would correspond only to disjoint union of subsets later authors changed the interpretation commonly reading it as exclusive or or in set theory terms symmetric difference this step means that addition is always defined3135 in fact there is the other possibility that should be read as disjunction34 this other possibility extends from the disjoint union case where exclusive or and nonexclusive or both give the same answer handling this ambiguity was an early problem of the theory reflecting the modern use of both boolean rings and boolean algebras which are simply different aspects of one type of structure boole and jevons struggled over just this issue in 1863 in the form of the correct evaluation of x x jevons argued for the result x which is correct for as disjunction boole kept the result as something undefined he argued against the result 0 which is correct for exclusive or because he saw the equation x x 0 as implying x 0 a false analogy with ordinary algebra12 probability theoryedit the second part of the laws of thought contained a corresponding attempt to discover a general method in probabilities here the goal was algorithmic from the given probabilities of any system of events to determine the consequent probability of any other event logically connected with those events36 deathedit in late november 1864 boole walked in heavy rain from his home at lichfield cottage in ballintemple37 to the university a distance of three miles and lectured wearing his wet clothes38 he soon became ill developing pneumonia3940 booles condition worsened and on 8 december 1864 he died of feverinduced pleural effusion he was buried in the church of ireland cemetery of st michaels church road blackrock a suburb of cork there is a commemorative plaque inside the adjoining church41 legacyedit boolean algebra is named after him as is the crater boole on the moon the keyword bool represents a boolean datatype in many programming languages though pascal and java among others both use the full name boolean42 the library underground lecture theatre complex and the boole centre for research in informatics43 at university college cork are named in his honour a road called boole heights in bracknell berkshire is named after him 19thcentury developmentedit booles work was extended and refined by a number of writers beginning with william stanley jevons augustus de morgan had worked on the logic of relations and charles sanders peirce integrated his work with booles during the 1870s44 other significant figures were platon sergeevich poretskii and william ernest johnson the conception of a boolean algebra structure on equivalent statements of a propositional calculus is credited to hugh maccoll 1877 in work surveyed 15 years later by johnson44 surveys of these developments were published by ernst schröder louis couturat and clarence irving lewis 20thcentury developmentedit in modern notation the free boolean algebra on basic propositions p and q arranged in a hasse diagram the boolean combinations make up 16 different propositions and the lines show which are logically related in 1921 the economist john maynard keynes published a book on probability theory a treatise of probability keynes believed that boole had made a fundamental error in his definition of independence which vitiated much of his analysis45 in his book the last challenge problem david miller provides a general method in accord with booles system and attempts to solve the problems recognised earlier by keynes and others theodore hailperin showed much earlier that boole had used the correct mathematical definition of independence in his worked out problems 46 booles work and that of later logicians initially appeared to have no engineering uses claude shannon attended a philosophy class at the university of michigan which introduced him to booles studies shannon recognised that booles work could form the basis of mechanisms and processes in the real world and that it was therefore highly relevant in 1937 shannon went on to write a masters thesis at the massachusetts institute of technology in which he showed how boolean algebra could optimise the design of systems of electromechanical relays then used in telephone routing switches he also proved that circuits with relays could solve boolean algebra problems employing the properties of electrical switches to process logic is the basic concept that underlies all modern electronic digital computers victor shestakov at moscow state university 1907–1987 proposed a theory of electric switches based on boolean logic even earlier than claude shannon in 1935 on the testimony of soviet logicians and mathematicians sofya yanovskaya gaazerapoport roland dobrushin lupanov medvedev and uspensky though they presented their academic theses in the same year 1938clarification needed but the first publication of shestakovs result took place only in 1941 in russian hence boolean algebra became the foundation of practical digital circuit design and boole via shannon and shestakov provided the theoretical grounding for the information age47 21stcentury celebrationedit booles legacy surrounds us everywhere in the computers information storage and retrieval electronic circuits and controls that support life learning and communications in the 21st century his pivotal advances in mathematics logic and probability provided

of his life bears a memorial plaque his former residence in grenville place is being restored through a collaboration between ucc and cork city council as the george boole house of innovation after the city council acquired the premises under the derelict sites act50 viewsedit booles views were given in four published addresses the genius of sir isaac newton the right use of leisure the claims of science and the social aspect of intellectual culture51 the first of these was from 1835 when charles andersonpelham 1st earl of yarborough gave a bust of newton to the mechanics institute in lincoln52 the second justified and celebrated in 1847 the outcome of the successful campaign for early closing in lincoln headed by alexander lesliemelville of branston hall53 the claims of science was given in 1851 at queens college cork54 the social aspect of intellectual culture was also given in cork in 1855 to the cuvierian society55 though his biographer des machale describes boole as an agnostic deist5657 boole read a wide variety of christian theology combining his interests in mathematics and theology he compared the christian trinity of father son and holy ghost with the three dimensions of space and was attracted to the hebrew conception of god as an absolute unity boole considered converting to judaism but in the end was said to have chosen unitarianism boole came to speak against a what he saw as prideful scepticism and instead favoured the belief in a supreme intelligent cause58 he also declared i firmly believe for the accomplishment of a purpose of the divine mind5960 in addition he stated that he perceived teeming evidences of surrounding design and concluded that the course of this world is not abandoned to chance and inexorable fate6162 two influences on boole were later claimed by his wife mary everest boole a universal mysticism tempered by jewish thought and indian logic63 mary boole stated that an adolescent mystical experience provided for his lifes work my husband told me that when he was a lad of seventeen a thought struck him suddenly which became the foundation of all his future discoveries it was a flash of psychological insight into the conditions under which a mind most readily accumulates knowledge for a few years he supposed himself to be convinced of the truth of the bible as a whole and even intended to take orders as a clergyman of the english church but by the help of a learned jew in lincoln he found out the true nature of the discovery which had dawned on him this was that mans mind works by means of some mechanism which functions normally towards monism64 in ch 13 of laws of thought boole used examples of propositions from baruch spinoza and samuel clarke the work contains some remarks on the relationship of logic to religion but they are slight and cryptic65 boole was apparently disconcerted at the books reception just as a mathematical toolset george afterwards learned to his great joy that the same conception of the basis of logic was held by leibnitz the contemporary of newton de morgan of course understood the formula in its true sense he was booles collaborator all along herbert spencer jowett and robert leslie ellis understood i feel sure and a few others but nearly all the logicians and mathematicians ignored 953 the statement that the book was meant to throw light on the nature of the human mind and treated the formula entirely as a wonderful new method of reducing to logical order masses of evidence about external fact64 mary boole claimed that there was profound influence — via her uncle george everest — of indian thought on george boole as well as on augustus de morgan and charles babbage think what must have been the effect of the intense hinduizing of three such men as babbage de morgan and george boole on the mathematical atmosphere of 1830–65 what share had it in generating the vector analysis and the mathematics by which investigations in physical science are now conducted64 familyedit in 1855 he married mary everest niece of george everest who later wrote several educational works on her husbands principles the booles had five daughters mary ellen1856–190866 who married the mathematician and author charles howard hinton and had four children george 1882–1943 eric 1884 william 1886–190967 and sebastian 1887–1923 inventor of

william h hinton 1919–2004 visited china in the 1930s and 40s and wrote an influential account of the communist land reform joan hinton 1921–2010 worked for the manhattan project and lived in china from 1948 until her death on 8 june 2010 she was married to sid engst margaret 1858 – 1935 married edward ingram taylor an artist their elder son geoffrey ingram taylor became a mathematician and a

selected manuscripts on logic and its philosophy 1997 p xlvi google books chapter xvi p 167 section 6 of a treatise on probability volume 4 the central error in his system of probability arises out of his giving two inconsistent definitions of independence 2 he first wins the readers acquiescence by giving a perfectly correct definition two events are said to be independent when the probability of either of them is unaffected by our expectation of the occurrence or failure of the other 3 but a moment later he interprets the term in quite a different sense for according to booles second definition we must regard the events as independent unless we are told either that they must concur or that they cannot concur that is to say they are independent unless we know for certain that there is in fact an invariable connection between them the simple events x y z will be said to be conditioned when they are not free to occur in every possible combination in other words when some compound event depending upon them is precluded from occurring simple unconditioned events are by definition independent 1 in fact as long as xz is possible x and z are independent this is plainly inconsistent with booles first definition with which he makes no attempt to reconcile it the consequences of his employing the term independence in a double sense are farreaching for he uses a method of reduction which is only valid when the arguments to which it is applied are independent in the first sense and assumes that it is valid if they are independent in second sense while his theorems are true if all propositions or events involved are independent in the first sense they are not true as he supposes them to be if the events are independent only in the second sense zetetic gleanings  that
