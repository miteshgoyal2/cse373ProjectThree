1860s some had settled in seattle many of the first chinese immigrants to washington came from guangdong province especially taishan6 the first chinese quarters were near yeslers mill on the waterfront according to chinese oral history the waterfront was the first chinatown where the chinese dock workers lived in 1886 whites drove out most of seattles chinese population however some took shelter with native americans on the reservations while others came under the protection of white employers and a judge the great seattle fire of 1889 further hindered the community eventually the chinese reestablished new quarters farther inland along washington st and second avenue south this was the second chinatown land values rose especially with impending construction of the smith tower and the people of chinatown moved again to the present and third location along king street only the hop sing tong managed to retain its building on 2nd and washington it sold this building about 2006

forced to other areas by the early 1900s a new chinatown began to develop along king street in 1910 goon dip a prominent businessman in seattles chinese american community9 led a group of chinese americans to form the kong yick investment company a benefit society their funding and efforts led to the construction of two buildings—the east kong yick building and the west kong yick building10 meanwhile filipino americans began arriving to replace the chinese dock workers who had moved inland according to pamana i a history of filipino americans in seattle they settled along first hill and the hotels and boarding houses of chinatown and japantown beginning in the early 1920s they were attracted to work as contract laborers in agriculture and salmon canneries1112 among them was filipino

japanese ancestry from seattle and the west coast in the wake of the attack on pearl harbor authorities moved them to inland internment camps where they lived from 1942 to 1946 most of seattles japanese residents were sent to minidoka in idaho14 after the war many returned to the pacific northwest but relocated to the suburbs or other districts in seattle a remaining vestige of the old
