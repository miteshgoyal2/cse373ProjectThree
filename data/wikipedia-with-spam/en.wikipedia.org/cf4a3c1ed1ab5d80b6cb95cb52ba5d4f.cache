broadcaster mike blowers in 2007 during a game against the cincinnati reds a fan tried to catch a foul ball along the rightfield line but in turn spilled his tray of french fries along the track while chatting on the air and seeing the mishap blowers partner dave sims suggested that he should send a new tray of fries to the fan blowers agreed and sent his intern to deliver a plate of fries to the man41 at the mariners next game fans made signs and boards asking blowers for fries as well coincidentally every time the fries were delivered the mariners seem to score or rally from a deficit and thus the rally fries were created this became so popular with the fans that signs were even seen when the mariners were the visiting team although on august 1 2009 blowers established that he only gives out fries at home games42 generally blowers will select a person or a group of people that appeals to him whether it is through fans wearing elaborate costumes or waving funny signs and boards the fries are usually delivered from ivars a seattlebased seafood restaurant with a location at safeco field the amount of fries given out varies with the size of the winning group of fans the winners are generally selected around the 5th or 6th inning although potential candidates are shown in almost every inning beforehand kings courtedit as the 2011 season progressed the mariners marketing staff came up with an idea to encourage the growing fanbase of star pitcher king félix hernández every hernandez start at safeco field is now accompanied by the kings court a designated cheering section for fans to sing chant and cheer while donning yellow tshirts and k cards that are supplied by the team the kings court is both a personal rooting section for hernandez and trendsetter for safeco field the team encouraged fans to dress like larry bernandez hernandezs alter ego from a mariners tv commercial or show up in wacky costumes rewarding the best with a ceremonial turkey leg43 the supreme court is a special occurrence when the kings court is extended to the entirety of safeco field the first supreme court was félixs first home game following his perfect game in 2012 since then it has
