and economic rightlibertarianism1 the philosophy is most closely associated with frank meyer2 contents 1 intellectual founding and positions 2 political history 3 prominent fusionists 4 critics 5 see also 6 notes 7 references 8 external links intellectual founding and positionsedit the philosophy of fusionism was developed at national review magazine during the 1950s under the editorship of william f buckley jr and is most identified with his associate editor frank meyer as buckley recounted the founding he brokered between an extraordinary mix of libertarians traditional conservatives anticommunists and even an anarchist to produce the ideas and writings that produced modern conservatism3 he identified meyers synthesis as the most likely best solution of defining conservatism4 in his most influential book in defense of freedom meyer defined freedom in what isaiah berlin would label negative terms as the minimization of the use of coercion by the state in its essential role of preventing one persons freedom from intruding upon anothers the state should protect freedom but otherwise leave virtue to individuals the state has only three legitimate functions – police military and operating a legal system all necessary to control coercion which is immoral if not restricted virtue is critical for society and freedom must be balanced by responsibility but both are inherently individual in form coerced values cannot be virtuous freedom by itself has no goal no intrinsic end freedom is not abstract or utopian as with the utilitarians who also make freedom an end rather than a means in a real society traditional order and freedom can only exist together the solution is a philosophical synthesis of both freedom and tradition the solution to the dilemma is grasping it by both horns and accepting the tension between the two5 fusionisms most famous advocate was ronald reagan as an early admirer of national review and associate of both editors on assuming the presidency in 1981 he met with conservative leaders around the country in washington and reminded them of their intellectual roots after listing intellectual leaders like russell kirk friedrich hayek henry hazlitt milton friedman james burnham and ludwig von mises as the ones who shaped so much of our thoughts he discussed only one of these influences at length its especially hard to believe that it was only a decade ago on a cold april day on a small hill in upstate new york that another of these great thinkers frank meyer was buried hed made the awful journey that so many others had he pulled himself from the clutches of the communist god that failed and then in his writing fashioned a vigorous new synthesis of traditional and libertarian thought – a synthesis that is today recognized by many as modern conservatism as he recalled him the new president outlined the ideas meyer synthesized as the principles for this new conservative movement it was frank meyer who reminded us that the robust individualism of the american experience was part of the deeper current of western learning and culture he pointed out that a respect for law an appreciation for tradition and regard for the social consensus that gives stability to our public and private institutions these civilized ideas must still motivate us even as we seek a new economic prosperity based on reducing government interference in the marketplace our goals complement each other were not cutting the budget simply for the sake of sounder financial management this is only a first step toward returning power to the states and communities only a first step toward reordering the relationship between citizen and government we can make government again responsive to the people by cutting its size and scope and thereby ensuring that its legitimate functions are performed efficiently and justly because ours is a consistent philosophy of government we can be very clear we do not have a separate social agenda separate economic agenda and a separate foreign agenda we have one agenda just as surely as we seek to put our financial house in order and rebuild our nations defenses so too we seek to protect the unborn to end the manipulation of schoolchildren by utopian planners and permit the acknowledgement of a supreme being in our classrooms just as we allow such acknowledgements in other public institutions6 political historyedit fusionism saw its height during the presidency of ronald reagan who had brought together the divided factions after gerald fords loss in the 1976 election rich lowry has argued that reagan maintained a fusionist sweet spot of both ideological flexibility and respect for conservative principles7 in the immediate aftermath of the republican takeover of congress in 1994 fusionism was also at its height the social conservative element of the republican party was seen on the ascent at least with respect to domestic politics during the presidency of george w bush increased spending angered traditional conservatives fiscal conservatives and libertarians8 in addition the longstanding tensions between neoconservatives and paleoconservatives bubbled over in the wake of the iraq war8 wisconsin congressman paul ryan said during a june 2009 hudson institute conference speech a libertarian who wants limited government should embrace the means to his freedom thriving mediating institutions that create the moral preconditions for economic markets and choice a social issues conservative with a zeal for righteousness should insist on a free market economy to supply the material needs for families schools and churches that inspire moral and spiritual life in a nutshell the notion of separating the social from the economic issues is a false choice they stem from the same root7 while both these principles are traditionally conservative the equal emphasis of traditional morality and free markets is a characteristic of fusionism following the republican partys defeat in the 2006 midterm elections some were calling for a new fusionism between libertarians and liberals in the democratic party to address what is seen as increasing governmental interference in private activity9 the results of the 2008 elections and the financial crisis of 2007–2010 have brought renewed tension between the libertarians and the social conservatives with centrist economic views8 fusionists tend to see the unpopularity of george w bush’s keynesian economic stimulus policies his “compassionate conservatism” such as in his new entitlement prescription drug program and his party’s following defeat by president barack obama in 2008 and 2012 as reasons requiring a fusionist renewal if conservatism was ever to regain the presidency 10 prominent fusionistsedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed
