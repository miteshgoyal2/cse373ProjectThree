for trade with asia seattle is the fourthlargest port in north america in terms of container handling as of 2015update10 the seattle area was previously inhabited by native americans for at least 4000 years before the first permanent european settlers11 arthur a denny and his group of travelers subsequently known as the denny party arrived from illinois via portland oregon on the schooner exact at alki point on november 13 185112 the settlement was moved to the eastern shore of elliott bay and named seattle in 1852 after chief siahl of the local duwamish and suquamish tribes logging was seattles first major industry but by the late 19th century the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to alaska during the klondike gold rush growth after world war ii was partially due to the local boeing company which established seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing the seattle area developed as a technology center beginning in the 1980s with companies like microsoft becoming established in the region internet retailer amazon was founded in seattle in 1994 the stream of new software biotechnology and internet companies led to an economic revival which increased the citys population by almost 50000 between 1990 and 2000 seattle has a noteworthy musical history from 1918 to 1951 nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs existed along jackson street from the current chinatowninternational district to the central district the jazz scene developed the early careers of ray charles quincy jones ernestine anderson and others seattle is also the birthplace of

of seattle and timeline of seattle founding archaeological excavations suggest that native americans have inhabited the seattle area for at least 4000 years11 by the time the first european settlers arrived the people subsequently called the duwamish tribe occupied at least seventeen villages in the areas around elliott bay141516 the first european to visit the seattle area was george vancouver in may 1792 during his 1791–95 expedition to chart the pacific northwest17 in 1851 a large party led by luther collins made a location on land at the mouth of the duwamish river they formally claimed it on september 14 185118 thirteen days later members of the collins party on the way to their claim passed three scouts of the denny party19 members of the denny party claimed land on alki point on september 28 185120 the rest of the denny party set sail from portland oregon and landed on alki point during a rainstorm on november 13 185120 duwamps 1852–1853 the battle of seattle 1856 after a difficult winter most of the denny party relocated across elliott bay and claimed land a second time at the site of presentday pioneer square20 naming this new settlement duwamps charles terry and john low remained at the original landing location and reestablished their old land claim and called it new york but renamed new york alki in april 1853 from a chinook word meaning roughly by and by or someday21 for the next few years new york alki and duwamps competed for dominance but in time alki was abandoned and its residents moved across the bay to join the rest of the settlers22 david swinson doc maynard one of the founders of duwamps was the primary advocate to name the settlement after chief sealth seattle of the duwamish and suquamish tribes232425 incorporations the name seattle appears on official washington territory papers dated may 23 1853 when the first plats for the village were filed in 1855 nominal land settlements were established on january 14 1865 the legislature of territorial washington incorporated the town of seattle with a board of trustees managing the city the town of seattle was disincorporated on january 18 1867 and remained a mere precinct of king county until late 1869 when a new petition was filed and the city was reincorporated december 2 1869 with a mayorcouncil government2026 the corporate seal of the city of seattle carries the date 1869 and a likeness of chief sealth in left profile27 timber town seattles first streetcar at the corner of occidental and yesler 1884 all of the buildings visible in this picture were destroyed by fire five years later seattle has a history of boomandbust cycles like many other cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources seattle has risen several times economically then gone into precipitous decline but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure28 the first such boom covering the early years of the city rode on the lumber industry during this period the road now known as yesler way won the nickname skid road supposedly after the timber skidding down the hill to henry yeslers sawmill the later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider american lexicon as skid row29 like much of the american west seattle saw numerous conflicts between labor and management as well as ethnic tensions that culminated in the antichinese riots of 1885–188630 this violence originated with unemployed whites who were determined to drive the chinese from seattle antichinese riots also occurred in tacoma in 1900 asians were 42 of the population31 authorities declared martial law and federal troops arrived to put down the disorder seattle achieved sufficient economic success that when the great seattle fire of 1889 destroyed the central business district a far grander citycenter rapidly emerged in its place32 finance company washington mutual for example was founded in the immediate wake of the fire33 however the panic of 1893 hit seattle hard34 gold rush world war i and the great depression the alaskayukonpacific exposition had just over 37 million visitors during its 138day run35 the second and most dramatic boom resulted from the klondike gold rush which ended the depression that had begun with the panic of 1893 in a short time seattle became a major transportation center on july 14 1897 the ss portland docked with its famed ton of gold and seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in alaska and the yukon few of those working men found lasting wealth however it was seattles business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run along with seattle other cities like everett tacoma port townsend bremerton and olympia all in the puget sound region became competitors for exchange rather than mother lodes for extraction of precious metals36 the boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century and funded many new seattle companies and products in 1907 19yearold james e casey borrowed 100 from a friend and founded the american messenger company later ups other seattle companies founded during this period include nordstrom and eddie bauer33 seattle brought in the olmsted brothers landscape architecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards37 pioneer square in 1917 featuring the smith tower the seattle hotel and to the left the pioneer building the gold rush era culminated in the alaskayukonpacific exposition of 1909 which is largely responsible for the layout of todays university of washington campus38 a shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during world war i making seattle somewhat of a company town the subsequent retrenchment led to the seattle general strike of 1919 the first general strike in the country39 a 1912 city development plan by virgil bogue went largely unused seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the great depression experiencing some of the countrys harshest labor strife in that era violence during the maritime strike of 1934 cost seattle much of its maritime traffic which was rerouted to the port of los angeles40 the great depression in seattle affected many minority groups one being the asian pacific americans they were subject to racism loss of property and failed claims of unemployment due to citizenship status41 seattle was one of the major cities that benefited from programs such as the wpa ccc ucl and pwa4243 the workers mostly men built roads parks dams schools railroads bridges docks and even historical and archival record sites and buildings however seattle faced massive unemployment loss of lumber and construction industries as los angeles prevailed as the bigger west coast city seattle had building contracts that rivaled new york city and chicago but lost to la as well seattle’s eastern farm land faded due to oregon’s and the midwest’s forcing people into town4445 the famous hooverville arose during the depression leading to seattle’s growing homeless population stationed outside seattle the hooverville housed thousands of men but very very few children and no women with work projects close to the city hooverville grew and the wpa settled into the city46 a movement by women arose from seattle during the depression fueled by eleanor roosevelt’s book it’s up to the women women pushed for recognition not just as housewives but as the backbone to family using newspapers and journals working woman and the woman today women pushed to be seen as equal and receive some recognition47 seattle’s university of washington was greatly affected during the depression era as schools across washington lost funding and attendance the uw actually prospered during the time period while seattle public schools were influenced by washington’s superintendent worth mcclure48 they still struggled to pay teachers and maintain attendance the uw despite academic challenges that plagued the college due to differing views on teaching and learning focused on growth in student enrollment rather than improving the existing school49 seattle was also the home base of impresario alexander pantages who starting in 1902 opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies his activities soon expanded and the thrifty greek went on and became one of americas greatest theater and movie tycoons between pantages and his rival john considine seattle was for a while the western united states vaudeville mecca b marcus priteca the scottishborn and seattlebased architect built several theaters for pantages including some in seattle the theaters he built for pantages in seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses but many other theaters survive in other cities of the us often retaining the pantages name seattles surviving paramount theatre on which he collaborated was not a pantages theater postwar years aircraft and software building the seattle center monorail 1961 looking north up fifth avenue from virginia street war work again brought local prosperity during world war ii this time centered on boeing aircraft the war dispersed the citys numerous japaneseamerican businessmen due to the japanese american internment after the war the local economy dipped it rose again with boeings growing dominance in the commercial airliner market50 seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the century 21 exposition the 1962 worlds fair51 another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s at a time when boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises loss of government contracts and costs and delays associated with the boeing 747 many people left the area to look for work elsewhere and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading will the last person leaving seattle – turn out the lights52 seattle remained the corporate headquarters of boeing until 2001 when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities the headquarters were moved to chicago53 the seattle area is still home to boeings renton narrowbody plant where the 707 720 727 and 757 were assembled and the 737 is assembled today and everett widebody plant assembly plant for the 747 767 777 and 787 the companys credit union for employees becu remains based in the seattle area though it is now open to all residents of washington as prosperity began to return in the 1980s the city was stunned by the wah mee massacre in 1983 when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the seattle chinatowninternational district54 beginning with microsofts 1979 move from albuquerque new mexico to nearby bellevue washington55 seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including amazoncom f5 networks realnetworks nintendo of america mccaw cellular now part of att mobility voicestream now tmobile and biomedical corporations such as heartstream later purchased by philips heart technologies later purchased by boston scientific physiocontrol later purchased by medtronic zymogenetics icos later purchased by eli lilly and company and immunex later purchased by amgen this success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50000 between 1990 and 200056 and saw seattles real estate become some of the most expensive in the country57 in 1993 the movie sleepless in seattle brought the city further national attention58 many of the seattle areas tech companies remained relatively strong but the frenzied dotcom boom years ended in early 20015960 seattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to these many companies but also by hosting the 1990 goodwill games61 and the apec leaders conference in 1993 as well as through the worldwide popularity of grunge a sound that had developed in seattles independent music scene62 another bid for worldwide attention—hosting the world trade organization ministerial conference of 1999—garnered visibility but not in the way its sponsors desired as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself63 the city was further shaken by the mardi gras riots in 2001 and then literally shaken the following day by the nisqually earthquake64 another boom began as the city emerged from the great recession which commenced when amazoncom moved its headquarters from north beacon hill to south lake union this initiated a historic construction boom which resulted in the completion of twice as many apartments in seattle in 2017 which is more than any other year in the city’s history65 for the next five years beginning in 2010 seattle gained an average of 14511 residents per year with the growth strongly skewed toward the center of the city66 as unemployment dropped from roughly 9 percent to 36 percent67 the city has found itself bursting at the seams with over 45000 households spending more than half their income on housing and at least 2800 people homeless and with the countrys sixthworst rush hour traffic67 geography with a land area of 839 square miles 2173 km²68 seattle is the northernmost city with at least 500000 people in the united states farther north than canadian cities such

the 1965 quake caused three deaths in seattle directly and one more by heart failure79 although the seattle fault passes just south of the city center neither it80 nor the cascadia subduction zone has caused an earthquake since the citys founding the cascadia subduction zone poses the threat of an earthquake of magnitude 90 or greater capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many

and september69 seattles climate is classified as oceanic or temperate marine with cool wet winters and mild relatively dry summers83 84 the city and environs are part of usda hardiness zone 8b with isolated coastal pockets falling under 9a85 temperature extremes are moderated by the adjacent puget sound greater pacific ocean and lake washington thus extreme heat waves are rare in the seattle area as are very cold temperatures below about 15 °f −9 °c the seattle area is the most cloudy region of the united states due in part to frequent storms and lows moving in from the adjacent pacific ocean despite having a reputation for frequent rain seattle receives less precipitation than many other us cities like chicago or new york city however unlike many other us cities seattle has many more rain days when a very light drizzle falls from the sky for many days86 in an average year at least 001 inches 025 mm of precipitation falls on 150 days more than nearly all us cities east of the rocky mountains87 it is cloudy 201 days out of the year and partly cloudy 93 days69 official weather and climatic data is collected at seattle–tacoma international airport located about 19 km 12 mi south of downtown in the city of seatac which is at a higher elevation and records more cloudy days and fewer partly cloudy days per year69 hot temperature extremes are enhanced by dry compressed wind from the west slopes of the cascades88 while cold temperatures are generated mainly from the fraser valley in british columbia89 from 1981 to 2010 the average annual precipitation measured at seattle–tacoma international airport was 3749 inches 952 mm annual precipitation has ranged from 2378 in 604 mm in 1952 to 5514 in 1401 mm in 1950 for water year october 1 – september 30 precipitation the range is 2316 in 588 mm in 1976–77 to 5182 in 1316 mm in 1996–9790 due to local variations in microclimate seattle also receives significantly lower precipitation than some other locations west of the cascades around 80 mi 129 km to the west the hoh rain forest in olympic national park on the western flank of the olympic mountains receives an annual average precipitation of 142 in 361 m sixty miles 95 km to the south of seattle the state capital olympia which is out of the olympic mountains rain shadow receives an annual average precipitation of 50 in 1270 mm90 the city of bremerton about 15 mi 24 km west of downtown seattle on the other side of the puget sound receives 564 in 1430 mm of precipitation annually90 conversely the northeastern portion of the olympic peninsula which lies east of the olympic mountains is located within the olympic rain shadow and receives significantly less precipitation than its surrounding areas prevailing airflow from the west is forced to cool and compress when colliding with the mountain range resulting in high levels of precipitation within the mountains and its western slopes once the airflow reaches the leeward side of the mountains it then lowers and expands resulting in warmer and significantly dryer air sequim washington nicknamed sunny sequim is located approximately 40 mi 64 km northwest of downtown seattle and receives just 1651 inches 419 mm of annual precipitation more comparable to that of los angeles oftentimes an area devoid of cloud cover can be seen extending out over the puget sound to the north and east of sequim on average sequim observes 127 sunny days per year in addition to 127 days with partial cloud cover other areas influenced by the olympic rain shadow include port angeles port townsend extending as far north as victoria british columbia91 in november seattle averages more rainfall than any other us city of more than 250000 people it also ranks highly in winter precipitation conversely the city receives some of the lowest precipitation amounts of any large city from june to september seattle is one of the five rainiest major us cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation and it receives some of the lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the lower 48 states along with some cities in the northeast ohio and michigan thunderstorms are rare92 as the city reports thunder on just seven days per year93 by comparison fort myers florida reports thunder on 93 days per year kansas city on 52 and new york city on 25 seattle experiences its heaviest rainfall during the months of november december and january receiving roughly half of its annual rainfall by volume during this period in late fall and early winter atmospheric rivers also known as pineapple express systems strong frontal systems and pacific low pressure systems are common light rain drizzle are the predominant forms of precipitation during the remainder of the year for instance on average less than 16 in 41 mm of rain falls in july and august combined when rain is rare on occasion seattle experiences somewhat more significant weather events one such event occurred on december 2–4 2007 when sustained hurricaneforce winds and widespread heavy rainfall associated with a strong pineapple express event occurred in the greater puget sound area and the western parts of washington and oregon precipitation totals exceeded 138 in 350 mm in some areas with winds topping out at 209 kmh 130 mph along coastal oregon94 it became the second wettest event in seattle history when a little over 130 mm 51 in of rain fell on seattle in a 24hour period lack of adaptation to the heavy rain contributed to five deaths and widespread flooding and damage95 autumn winter and early spring are frequently characterized by rain winters are cool and wet with december the coolest month averaging 406 °f 48 °c with 28 annual days with lows that reach the freezing mark and 20 days where the temperature stays at or below freezing all day90 the temperature rarely lowers to 20 °f −7 °c90 summers are sunny dry and warm with august the warmest month with high temperatures averaging 761 °f 245 °c and reaching 90 °f 32 °c on 31 days per year in 2015 the city recorded 13 days over 90 °f90 the hottest officially recorded temperature was 103 °f 39 °c on july 29 200996 the coldest recorded temperature was 0 °f −18 °c on january 31 195097 the record cold daily maximum is 16 °f −9 °c on january 14 1950 while conversely the record warm daily minimum is 71 °f 22 °c the day the official record high was set90 the average window for freezing temperatures is november 16 through march 10 allowing a growing season of 250 days90 seattle typically receives some snowfall on an annual basis but heavy snow is rare average annual snowfall as measured at seatac airport is 68 inches 173 cm single calendarday snowfall of six inches 15 cm or greater has occurred on only 15 days since 1948 and only once since february 17 1990 when 68 in 173 cm of snow officially fell at seatac airport on january 18 2012 this moderate snow event was officially the 12th snowiest calendar day at the airport
