reading 11 external links historyedit beginnings 1887–1929edit original home of columbia in washington dc in 1889 the columbia phonograph company was founded in 1887 by stenographer lawyer and new jersey native edward d easton 1856–1915 and a group of investors it derived its name from the district of columbia where it was headquartered78 at first it had a local monopoly on sales and service of edison phonographs and phonograph cylinders in washington dc maryland and delaware as was the custom of some of the regional phonograph companies columbia produced many commercial cylinder recordings of its own and its catalogue of musical records in 1891 was 10 pages columbias ties to edison and the north american phonograph company were severed in 1894 with the north american phonograph companys breakup thereafter it sold only records and phonographs of its own manufacture in 1902 columbia introduced the xp record a molded brown wax record to use up old stock columbia introduced black wax records in 1903 and according to tim gracyk continued to mold brown waxes until 1904 the highest number known to gracyk is 32601 heinie which is a duet by arthur collins and byron g harlan according to gracyk the molded brown waxes may have been sold to sears for distribution possibly under sears oxford trademark for columbia products9 columbia began selling disc records invented and patented by victor talking machine companys emile berliner and phonographs in addition to the cylinder system in 1901 preceded only by their toy graphophone of 1899 which used small vertically cut records for a decade columbia competed with both the edison phonograph company cylinders and the victor talking machine company disc records as one of the top three names in american recorded sound in order to add prestige to its early catalog of artists columbia contracted a number of new york metropolitan opera stars to make recordings from 1903 onward these stars included marcella sembrich lillian nordica antonio scotti and edouard de reszke but the technical standard of their recordings was not considered to be as high as the results achieved with classical singers during the pre–world war i period by victor edison englands his masters voice the gramophone company ltd or italys fonotipia records after an abortive attempt in 1904 to manufacture discs with the recording grooves stamped into both sides of each disc—not just one—in 1908 columbia commenced successful mass production of what they called their doublefaced discs the 10inch variety initially selling for 65 cents apiece the firm also introduced the internalhorn grafonola to compete with the extremely popular victrola sold by the rival victor talking machine company a columbia type at cylinder graphophone first released in 189810 during this era columbia used the famous magic notes logo—a pair of sixteenth notes semiquavers in a circle—both in the united states and overseas where this particular logo would never substantially change columbia stopped recording and manufacturing wax cylinder records in 1908 after arranging to issue celluloid cylinder records made by the indestructible record company of albany new york as columbia indestructible records in july 1912 columbia decided to concentrate exclusively on disc records and stopped manufacturing cylinder phonographs although they continued selling indestructibles cylinders under the columbia name for a year or two more columbia was split into two companies one to make records and one to make players columbia phonograph was moved to connecticut and ed easton went with it eventually it was renamed the dictaphone corporation7 in late 1923 columbia went into receivership the company was bought by its english subsidiary the columbia graphophone company in 1925 and the label record numbering system and recording process changed the new process still acoustic was used on budget labels until 1930 see more at american columbia single record cataloging systems on february 25 1925 columbia began recording with the new electric recording process licensed from western electric the new vivatonal records set a benchmark in tone and clarity unequaled on commercial discs during the 78rpm era the first electrical recordings were made by art gillham the popular whispering pianist in a secret agreement with victor neither company made the new recording technology public knowledge for some months in order not to hurt sales of their existing acoustically recorded catalog while a new electrically recorded catalog was being compiled the label of an electrically recorded columbia disc by art gillham from the midtwenties the label of an electrically recorded columbia disc by paul whiteman in 1926 columbia acquired okeh records and its growing stable of jazz and blues artists including louis armstrong and clarence williams columbia had already built an impressive catalog of blues and jazz artists including bessie smith in their highly successful 14000d race series columbia also had a very successful hillbilly series 15000d in 1928 paul whiteman the nations most popular orchestra leader left victor to record for columbia that same year columbia executive frank buckley walker pioneered some of the first country music or hillbilly genre recordings with the johnson city sessions in tennessee including artists such as clarence horton greene and the legendary fiddler and entertainer fiddlin charlie bowman he followed that with a return to tennessee the next year as well as recording sessions in other cities of the south 1929 saw industry legend ben selvin signing on as house bandleader and a r director other favorites in the vivatonal era included ruth etting paul whiteman fletcher henderson ipana troubadours a sam lanin group ben selvin and ted lewis columbia kept using acoustic recording for budget label pop product well into 1929 on the labels harmony velvet tone both general purpose labels and diva sold exclusively at wt grant stores 1929 was the year that columbias older rival and former affiliate edison records folded leaving columbia as the oldest surviving record label columbia ownership separation 1931–1936edit in 1931 the british columbia graphophone company itself originally a subsidiary of american columbia records then to become independent actually went on to purchase its former parent american columbia in late 1929 merged with the gramophone company to form electric musical industries ltd emi emi was forced to sell its american columbia operations because of antitrust concerns and the grigsbygrunow company makers of the majestic radio were the purchaser but majestic soon fell on hard times an abortive attempt in 1932 around the same time that victor was experimenting with its 33 1⁄3 program transcriptions was the longer playing record a finergrooved 10 78 with 430 to 500 playing time per side columbia issued about eight of these in the 18000d series as well as a shortlived series of doublegrooved longer playing records on its clarion records harmony and velvet tone labels all of these experiments and indeed the clarion harmony and velvet tone labels were discontinued by mid1932 a longerlived marketing ploy was the columbia royal blue record a brilliant blue laminated product with matching label royal blue issues made from late 1932 through 1935 are particularly popular with collectors for their rarity and musical interest the columbla plant in oakland california did columbias pressings for sale west of the rockies and continued using the royal blue material for these until about mid1936 with the great depressions tightened economic stranglehold on the country in a day when the phonograph itself had become a passé luxury nothing slowed columbias decline it was still producing some of the most remarkable records of the day especially on sessions produced by john hammond and financed by emi for overseas release grigsbygrunow went under in 1934 and was forced to sell columbia for a mere 70000 to the american record corporation arc11 this combine already included brunswick as its premium label so columbia was relegated to slower sellers such as the hawaiian music of andy iona the irving mills stable of artists and songs and the still unknown benny goodman by late 1936 pop releases were discontinued leaving the label essentially defunct in 1935 herbert m greenspon an 18yearold shipping clerk led a committee to organize the first trade union shop at the main manufacturing factory in bridgeport connecticut elected as president of the congress of industrial unions cio local greenspon negotiated the first contract between factory workers and columbia management in a career with columbia that lasted 30 years greenspon retired after achieving the position of executive vice president of the company the former columbia records factory in bridgeport which closed in 196412 has been converted into an apartment building called columbia towers13 as southern gospel developed columbia had astutely sought to record the artists associated with the emerging genre for example columbia was the only company to record charles davis tillman most fortuitously for columbia in its depression era financial woes in 1936 the company entered into an exclusive recording contract with the chuck wagon gang a hugely successful relationship which continued into the 1970s a signature group of southern gospel the chuck wagon gang became columbias bestsellers with at least 37 million records14 many of them through the aegis of the mull singing convention of the air sponsored on radio and later television by southern gospel broadcaster j bazzel mull 1914–2006 another event in this period that would prove to be of incalculable future importance to columbia was the 1937 hiring of a new talent scout music writer producer and impresario john hammond alongside his extraordinary significance as a discoverer promoter connector and producer of jazz blues and folk artists during the swing music era hammond had already been of great help to columbia in 1932–33 through his involvement in the uk music paper melody maker hammond had arranged for the struggling us columbia label to provide recordings for the uk columbia label mostly using the specially created columbia w265000 matrix series hammond recorded fletcher henderson benny carter joe venuti and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough that many of them would not have had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz a handful of these in this special series were issued in the us hammonds work for columbia was interrupted by his service during wwii and he had less involvement with the music scene during the bebop era but when returned to work as a talent scout for columbia in the 1950s his career proved to be of incalculable historical and cultural importance the list of superstar artists he would discover and sign to columbia over the course of his career included charlie christian count basie teddy wilson pete seeger bob dylan leonard cohen aretha franklin bruce springsteen and stevie ray vaughan and in the early 1960s hammond would also exert an enormous cultural effect on the emerging rock music scene thanks to his championing of reissue lps of the music of blues artists robert johnson and bessie smith cbs takes over 1938–1947edit columbia notes and mic logo in 1938 arc including the columbia label in the usa was bought by william s paley of the columbia broadcasting system for us75000015 columbia records had originally cofounded cbs in 1927 along with new york talent agent arthur judson but soon cashed out of the partnership leaving only the name paley acquired the fledgling radio network in 1928 cbs revived the columbia label in place of brunswick and the okeh label in place of vocalion cbs renamed the company columbia recording corporation16 and retained control of all of arcs past masters but in a complicated move the pre1931 brunswick and vocalion masters as well as trademarks of brunswick and vocalion reverted to warner bros who had leased their whole recording operation to arc in early 1932 and warners sold the lot to decca records in 194117 the columbia trademark from this point until the late 1950s was two overlapping circles with the magic notes in the left circle and a cbs microphone in the right circle the royal blue labels now disappeared in favor of a deep red which caused rca victor to claim infringement on its red seal trademark rca lost the case the blue columbia label was kept for its classical music columbia masterworks records line until it was later changed to a green label before switching to a gray label in the late 1950s and then to the bronze that is familiar to owners of its classical and broadway albums columbia phonograph company of canada did not survive the great depression so cbs made a distribution deal with sparton records in 1939 to release columbia records in canada under the columbia name during the 1940s columbia had a contract with frank sinatra sinatra helped boost columbia in revenue sinatra recorded over 200 songs with columbia which include his most popular songs from his early years other popular artists on columbia included benny goodman signed from rca victor count basie jimmie lunceford both signed from decca eddy duchin ray noble both moved to columbia from brunswick kate smith mildred bailey and will bradley in 1947 cbs founded its mexican record company discos columbia de mexico18 1948 also saw the first classical lp nathan milsteins recording of the mendelssohn violin concerto columbias 33 rpm format quickly spelled the death of the classical 78 rpm record and for the first time gave columbia a commanding lead over rca victor red seal1920 the lp record 1948–1959edit columbias president edward wallerstein instrumental in steering paley to the arc purchase at this time set his talents to the goal as he saw it of hearing an entire movement of a symphony on one side of an album ward botsford writing for the twentyfifth anniversary issue of high fidelity magazine relates he was no inventor—he was simply a man who seized an idea whose time was ripe and begged ordered and cajoled a thousand men into bringing into being the now accepted medium of the record business despite wallersteins stormy tenure in 1948 columbia introduced the long playing microgroove lp record format sometimes written lp in early advertisements which rotated at 33⅓ revolutions per minute to be the standard for the gramophone record for half a century cbs research director dr peter goldmark played a managerial role in the collaborative effort but wallerstein credits engineer william savory with the technical prowess that brought the longplaying disc to the public21 by the early 1940s columbia had been experimenting with higher fidelity recordings as well as longer masters which paved the way for the successful release of the lps in 1948 one such record that helped set a new standard for music listeners was the 10 lp reissue of the voice of frank sinatra originally released on march 4 1946 as an album of four 78 rpm records which was the first pop album issued in the new lp format sinatra was arguably columbias hottest commodity and his artistic vision combined with the direction columbia were taking the medium of music both popular and classic were well suited the voice of frank sinatra was also considered to be the first genuine concept album since the term lp has come to refer to the 12 inch 33  1⁄3 rpm vinyl disk the first lp is the mendelssohn violin concerto in e minor played by nathan milstein with bruno walter conducting the new york philharmonic then called the philharmonicsymphony orchestra of new york columbia ml 4001 found in the columbia record catalog for 1949 published in july 1948 the other lps listed in the catalog were in the 10 inch format starting with ml 2001 for the light classics cl 6001 for popular songs and jl 8001 for childrens records21 the library of congress washington dc now holds the columbia records paperwork archive which shows the label order for ml 4001 being written on march 1 1948 one can infer that columbia was pressing the first lps for distribution to their dealers for at least 3 months prior to the introduction of the lp in june 194822 the catalog numbering system has had minor changes ever since columbias lps were particularly wellsuited to classical musics longer pieces so some of the early albums featured such artists as eugene ormandy and the philadelphia orchestra bruno walter and the new york philharmonic orchestra and sir thomas beecham and the royal philharmonic orchestra the success of these recordings eventually persuaded capitol records to begin releasing lps in 1949 rca victor began releasing lps in 1950 quickly followed by other major american labels decca records in the uk was the first to release lps in europe beginning in 1949 an original cast recording of rodgers hammersteins south pacific with ezio pinza and mary martin was recorded in 1949 both conventional metal masters and tape were used in the sessions in new york city for some reason the taped version was not used until sony released it as part of a set of cds devoted to columbias broadway albums23 over the years columbia joined decca and rca victor in specializing in albums devoted to broadway musicals with members of the original casts in the 1950s columbia also began releasing lps drawn from the soundtracks of popular films many album covers put together by columbia and the other major labels were put together using one piece of cardboard folded in half and two paper slicks one for the front and one for the back the front slick bended around the top bottom and left sides the right side is open for the record to be inserted into the cover and glued the two halves of cardboard together at the top and bottom the back slick is pasted over the edges of the pastedon front slick to make it appear that the album cover is one continuous piece columbia discovered that printing two front cover slicks one for mono and one for stereo was inefficient and therefore needlessly costly starting in the summer of 1959 with some of the albums released in august they went to the pasteover front slick which had the stereo information printed on the top and the mono information printed on the bottom for stereo issues they moved the front slick down so the stereo information was showing at the top and the mono information was bent around the bottom to the back and pasted over by the back slick conversely for a mono album they moved the slick up so the mono information showed at the bottom and the stereo information was pasted over the 1950sedit transitional 1955 promo 45 rpm label showing both the old notes and mike and new walking eye logos columbia used this label for its 45 rpm records from 1951 until 1958 in 1951 columbia usa began issuing records in the 45 rpm format rca had introduced two years earlier24 the same year ted wallerstein retired as columbia records chairman25 and columbia usa also severed its decadeslong distribution arrangement with emi and signed a distribution deal with philips records to market columbia recordings outside north america26 emi continued to distribute okeh and later epic label recordings until 1968 emi also continued to distribute columbia recordings in australia and new zealand american columbia was not happy with emis reluctance to introduce long playing records27 columbia became the most successful nonrock record company in the 1950s after it lured producer and bandleader mitch miller away from the mercury label in 1950 despite its many successes columbia remained largely uninvolved in the teenage rocknroll market until the mid1960s despite a handful of crossover hits largely because of millers famous and frequently expressed loathing of rocknroll miller was a classically trained oboist who had been a friend of columbia executive goddard lieberson since their days at the eastman school of music in the 1930s28 miller quickly signed up mercurys biggest artist at the time frankie laine and discovered several of the decades biggest recording stars including tony bennett mahalia jackson jimmy boyd guy mitchell whose stage surname was taken from millers first name johnnie ray the four lads rosemary clooney ray conniff jerry vale and johnny mathis he also oversaw many of the early singles by the labels top female recording star of the decade doris day in 1953 columbia formed a new subsidiary label epic records29 1954 saw columbia end its distribution arrangement with sparton records and form columbia records of canada30 despite the appearance of favoring a country music genre columbia bid 15000 for elvis presleys contract from sun records in 195531 miller made no secret of the fact that he was not a fan of rock music and was saved from having to deal with it when presleys manager colonel tom parker turned down their offer presley ended up signing with columbias nowsister label rca victor31 however columbia did sign two sun artists in 1958 johnny cash and carl perkins31 with 1954 columbia usa decisively broke with its past when it introduced its new moderniststyle walking eye logo32 designed by columbias art director s neil fujita this logo actually depicts a stylus the legs on a record the eye however the eye also subtly refers to cbss main business in television and that divisions iconic eye logo columbia continued to use the notes and mike logo on record labels and even used a promo label showing both logos until the notes and mike was phased out along with the 78 in the us in 1958 in canada columbia 78s were pressed with the walking eye logo in 1958 the original walking eye was tall and solid it was modified in 196133 to the familiar one still used today pictured on this page despite the fact that the walking eye was not used during most of the 1990s although the onset of longplaying vinyl hifi records coincided with the publics loss of interest in big bands columbia maintained duke ellington under contract capturing the historic moment when ellingtons band provoked a postmidnight frenzy followed by international headlines at the 1956 newport jazz festival which proved a boost not only to the venerable bandleader and the barely established venue of the outdoor music festival but a harbinger of the musical lovefest that was woodstock under new head producer george avakian columbia became the most vital label to the general publics appreciation and understanding with help from avakians prolific and perceptive playbyplay liner notes of americas indigenous art releasing the most important lps by the musics founding father louis armstrong but also signing to longterm contracts dave brubeck and miles davis the two modern jazz artists who would in 1959 record albums that remain—more than a half century later—among the bestselling jazz albums by any label—viz time out by the brubeck quartet and to an even greater extent kind of blue by the davis sextet with another producer teo macero a skilled modernist composer himself columbia cemented contracts with jazz giants thelonious monk and charles mingus while macero became a key agent in recording and representing—through attentiongrabbing colorful—albums the protean faces of miles davis—from leading exponent of cool jazz to innovator and avatar of the marriage of jazz with rock and electronic sounds—commonly known as jazz fusion 1954 was the eventful year of columbias embracing smallgroup modern jazz—first in the signing of the dave brubeck quartet which resulted in the release of the onlocation bestselling jazz album up to this time jazz goes to college contemporaneously with columbias first release of modern jazz by a small group which was also the brubeck quartets debut on the label was a time magazine cover story on the phenomenon of brubecks success on college campuses the humble dave brubeck demurred saying that the second time magazine cover story on a jazz musician the first featured louis armstrongs picture had been earned by duke ellington not himself within two years ellingtons picture would appear on the cover of time magazine following his wild success at the 1956 newport jazz festival ellington at newport recorded on columbia was also the bandleadercomposerpianists bestselling album moreover this exclusive trinity of jazz giants featured on time magazine were all columbia artists in the early 1960s columbia jazz artist thelonious monk would be afforded the same honor in 1956 columbia jazz producer george avakian signed miles davis to the label in 1958 daviss sextet released milestones an influential album which explored the techniques of modal jazz in 1959 daviss sextet released kind of blue an album which has remained extremely popular and influential in 2003 it appeared as number 12 in rolling stones list of the 500 greatest albums of all time34 columbia changed distributors in australia and new zealand in 1956 when the australian record company picked up distribution of us columbia product to replace the capitol records product which arc lost when emi bought capitol as emi owned the columbia trademark at that time the us columbia material was issued in australia and new zealand on the cbs coronet label in the same year former columbia ar manager goddard lieberson was promoted to president of the entire cbs recording division which included columbia and epic as well as the companys various international divisions and licensees under his leadership the corporations music division soon overtook rca victor as the top recording company in the world boasting a starstudded roster of artists and an unmatched catalogue of popular jazz classical and stage and screen soundtrack titles lieberson who had joined columbia as an ar manager in 1938 was noted for both his personal elegance and his dedication to quality overseeing the release of many hugely successful albums and singles as well as championing prestige releases that sold relatively poorly and even some titles that had very limited appeal such as complete editions of the works of arnold schoenberg and anton von webern one of his first major successes was the original cast soundtrack of my fair lady which sold over 5 million copies worldwide in 1957 becoming the most successful lp ever released up to that time lieberson also convinced longserving cbs president william s paley to become the sole backer of the original broadway production a 500000 investment which subsequently earned the company some 32 million in profits35 stereoedit although columbia began recording in stereo in 1956 stereo lps did not begin to be manufactured until 1958 one of columbias first stereo releases was an abridged and restructured performance of handels messiah by the new york philharmonic and the westminster choir conducted by leonard bernstein recorded on december 31 1956 on 12 inch tape using an ampex 3003 machine bernstein combined the nativity and resurrection sections and ended the performance with the death of christ as with rca victor most of the early stereo recordings were of classical artists including the new york philharmonic orchestra conducted by bruno walter dimitri mitropoulos and leonard bernstein and the philadelphia orchestra conducted by eugene ormandy who also recorded an abridged messiah for columbia some sessions were made with the columbia symphony orchestra an ensemble drawn from leading new york musicians which had first made recordings with sir thomas beecham in 1949 in columbias famous new york city studios george szell and the cleveland orchestra recorded mostly for epic when epic dropped classical music the roster and catalogue was moved to columbia masterworks records columbia released its first pop stereo albums in the summer of 1958 all of the first dozen or so were stereo versions of albums already available in mono it wasnt until september 1958 that columbia started simultaneous monostereo releases mono records sold to the general public were subsequently discontinued in 1968 as far as the catalog numbering system went there was no correlation between mono and stereo versions for the first few years columbia started a new cs 8000 series for pop stereo releases and figuring the stereo releases as some sort of specialty niche records didnt bother to link the mono and stereo numbers for two years masterworks classical lps had an ms 6000 series while showtunes albums on masterworks were os 2000 finally in 1960 the pop stereo series jumped from 8300 to 8310 to match the lambert hendricks ross album issued as cl1510 from that point the stereo numbers on pop albums were exactly 6800 higher than the mono stereo classical albums were the mono number plus 600 and showtunes releases were the mono number minus 3600 only the last two digits in the respective catalog series matched pop stereo lps got into the high 9000s by 1970 when cbs records revamped and unified its catalog numbering system across all its labels masterworks classical albums were in the 7000s while showtunes

not be released under the columbia records name because emi operated a separate record label by that name columbia graphophone company outside north america this was the result of legal maneuvers

an enormous boost when mitch miller its ar manager and bandleader became the host of the variety series sing along with mitch on nbc the show was based on millers folksy but appealing chorus style performance of popular standards during its fourseason run the series promoted millers singalong albums which sold over 20 million units and received a 34 audience share when it was cancelled in 196437 in september 1961 cbs ar manager john hammond was producing the first columbia album by folk singer carolyn hester who invited a friend to accompany her on one of the recording sessions it was here that hammond first met bob dylan whom he signed to the label initially as a harmonica player38 dylans selftitled debut album was released in march 1962 and sold only moderately some in the company dubbed dylan hammonds folly and suggest that dylan be dropped from the label but john hammond and johnny cash defended dylan who over the next four years became one of columbias most important acts bob dylan rocketed to international stardom and became one of the most influential performers in the world over the course of the 1960s dylan achieved a prominent position in columbia his early folk songs were recorded by many acts and became hits for peter paul mary and the turtles some of these cover versions became the foundation of the folk rock genre the byrds achieved their pop breakthrough with a version of dylans mr tambourine man in 1965 dylans controversial decision to go electric and work with rock musicians divided his audience but catapulted him to greater commercial success with his 1965 hit single like a rolling stone following his withdrawal from touring in 1966 dylan recorded a large group of songs with his backing group the band which reached other artists as demo recordings these resulted in hits by manfred mann the mighty quinn and brian auger julie driscoll trinity this wheels on fire dylans late 1960s albums john wesley harding and nashville skyline became cornerstone recordings of the emergent country rock genre and influenced the byrds and the flying burrito brothers converting monoedit columbias engineering department developed a process for emulating stereo from a mono source they called this process electronically rechanneled for stereo in the june 16 1962 issue of billboard magazine page 5 columbia announced it would issue rechanneled versions of greatest hits compilations that had been recorded in mono including albums by doris day frankie laine percy faith mitch miller marty robbins dave brubeck miles davis and johnny mathis columbias rechanneling process involved a slight time delay and some basstreble separation between channels rca and capitol duophonic used similar processes but the relatively large delay between channels resulted in a sound that has been described by collectors as messy duophonic or garbage can echo rca columbias rechanneling resulted in a sound similar to reverb though some found it annoyingcitation needed rock and rolledit when the british invasion arrived in january 1964 columbia had no rock musicians on its roster except for dion who was signed in 1963 as the labels first major rock star the label released a merseybeat album the exciting new liverpool sound columbia cl2172 issued in mono only terry melcher son of doris day produced the hard driving dont make my baby

columbia the rip chords a vocal group consisting of ernie bringas and phil stewart and turned it into a rock group through production techniques the group had hits in here i stand a remake of the song by wade flemons and hey little cobra columbia saw the two recordings as a start to getting into rock and roll melcher and johnston recorded several additional singles for columbia in 1964 as bruce terry and later as the rogues melcher produced early albums by the byrds and paul revere the raiders for columbia while johnston produced the beach boys for capitol records ascension of clive davisedit when mitch miller retired in 196539 columbia was at a turning point millers disdain for rock and roll and pop rock had dominated columbias ar policy the labels only significant pop acts at the time were bob dylan the byrds and simon garfunkel in its catalogue were other genres classical jazz country and rb38 4041 in 1967 clive davis became president of columbia sales of broadway soundtracks and mitch millers singalong series were waning pretax earnings had flattened to about 5 million annually37 following the appointment of brooklynborn lawyer clive davis as president in 1967 the columbia label became more of a rock music label thanks mainly to daviss fortuitous decision to attend the monterey international pop festival where he spotted and signed several leading acts including janis joplin joplin led the way for several generations of female rock and rollers however columbiacbs still had a hand in traditional pop and jazz and one of its key acquisitions during this period was barbra streisand she released her first solo album on columbia in 1963 and remains with the label to this day additionally the label kept miles davis on the roster and his late 1960s recordings in a silent way and bitches brew pioneered a fusion of jazz and rock music42 a san francisco group called moby grape had been gaining popularity on the west coast and were signed by davis in 1967 as a way of introducing them to the world with a splash they released their debut album along with five singles from the album all on the same day june 6 1967 23 years following dday the album hit made 24 on the billboard 200 but the singles barely made a dent in the charts the best performer being omaha which lasted a mere three weeks on the hot 100 reaching only no 88 the other charter hey grandma only reached the bubbling under chart and faded within a week also there were some complaints about the obscene gesture made to the american flag on the front cover that had to be edited out on the second pressing not to mention that the group started to decline in sales after that the return on all the promotional budget for the singles realized nothing although the group made two more albums this particular publicity stunt was never again attempted by columbia or any other major label simon garfunkeledit arguably the most commercially successful columbia pop act of this period other than bob dylan was simon garfunkel the duo scored a surprise no 1 hit in 1965 when cbs producer tom wilson inspired by the folkrock experiments of the byrds and others added drums and bass to the duos earlier recording of the sound of silence without their knowledge or approval indeed the duo had already broken up some months earlier discouraged by the poor sales of their debut lp and paul simon had relocated to the uk where he famously only found out about the single being a hit via the music press the dramatic success of the song prompted simon to return to the usa the duo reformed and they soon became one of the flagship acts of the folkrock boom of the mid1960s their next album parsley sage rosemary and thyme went to no 4 on the billboard album chart and spawned the top 20 single a hazy shade of winter but progress slowed during 196667 as simon struggled with writers block and the demands of constant touring they shot back to the top in 1968 after simon agreed to write songs for the mike nichols film the graduate the resulting single mrs robinson became a smash hit and both the graduate soundtrack and simon garfunkels next studio album bookends were major hits on the album chart with combined total sales in excess of five million copies simon and garfunkels fifth and final studio album bridge over troubled water 1970 reached number one in the us album charts in january 1970 and became one of the most successful albums of all time43 hoyt axton and tom rushedit davis lured artists hoyt axton and tom rush to columbia in 1969 and both were given what was known as the pop treatment by the label hoyt axton had been a folkblues singersongwriter since the early 1960s when he made several albums for horizon then veejay by the time he joined columbia he had mixed successful pop songs like greenback dollar with hard rock songs for steppenwolf such as the pusher which was used in the film easy rider in the same year when he landed at columbia his album my griffin is gone was described as the poster child for overproduced full of all kinds of instruments and even strings44 after that album axton left and joined capitol records where his next albums contained joy to the world and never been to spain which the group three dog night made hit songs out of axton eventually became a country singer and founded his own record label jeremiah tom rush had always been the storyteller or balladeer type of folk artist before and after his stint with columbia to which rush was lured from elektra as with axton rush was given the treatment on his selftitled columbia debut the multitude of instruments added to his usual solo guitar were all done tastefully of course but was not really on par with rushs audience expectations he commented to record label historian mike callahan “ well when youre in the studio they bring out all these sweeteners and things they have and while youre there you say yeah that sounds good but then you get the album home and you almost cant hear yourself under all that44 ” eventually rush returned to his usual sound which he applied to his next three albums for columbia and has been playing to appreciative audiences ever since the 1970sedit catalog numbersedit the columbia album series which began way back in 1951 with album gl500 cl500 reached an awkward milestone in 1970 when the stereo numbering sequence reached cs9999 assigned to the patti page album honey come back this presented a catalog numbering system challenge as columbia had for 13 years used a fourdigit catalog number and cs10000 seemed cumbersome temporarily they settled on cs1000 instead preserving the fourdigit catalog number however they were reusing catalog numbers used in 195758 even if the prefix was now different in july 1970 the cataloging department implemented a new system altogether combining all their labels into one consolidated catalog numbering system starting with 30000 with the prefix letter indicating which label it was ccolumbia eepic scolumbia masterworks and zevery other label that cbs distributed there was also gtwo album sets45 the highest catalog number released in the old system was cs1069 the sesame street book and record chronologically columbia issued at least one album in this series in august but by that time the cbs consolidated 30000 series which started issuing albums in july with the new label design was well underway having issued nearly 100 albums quadraphonicsedit in september 1970 under the guidance of clive davis columbia records entered the west coast rock market opening a stateofthe art recording studio which was located at 827 folsom st in san francisco and later morphed into the automatt and establishing an ar head and office in san francisco at fishermans wharf headed by george daly a producer and artist for monument records who inked a distribution deal with columbia at the time and a former bandmate of nils lofgren and roy buchanan the recording studio operated under cbs until 197846 during the early 1970s columbia began recording in a fourchannel process called quadraphonic using the sq stereo quadraphonic standard which used an electronic encoding process that could be decoded by special amplifiers and then played through four speakers with each speaker placed in the corner of a room remarkably rca countered with another quadraphonic process which required a special cartridge to play the discrete recordings for fourchannel playback both columbia and rcas quadraphonic records could be played on conventional stereo equipment although the columbia process required less equipment and was quite effective many were confused by the competing systems and sales of both columbias matrix recordings and rcas discrete recordings were disappointing a few other companies also issued some matrix recordings for a few years quadraphonic recording was used by both classical artists including leonard bernstein and pierre boulez and popular artists such as electric light orchestra billy joel pink floyd johnny cash barbra streisand carlos santana herbie hancock the clash and blue öyster cult columbia even released a soundtrack album of the movie version of funny girl in quadraphonic many of these recordings were later remastered and released in dolby surround sound on cd yetnikoff becomes presidentedit in 1975 walter yetnikoff was promoted to become president of columbia records and his vacated position as president of cbs records international was filled by dick asher at this point according to music historian frederic dannen the shy and introverted yetnikoff began to transform his personality becoming in ashers words wild menacing crude and above all very loud in dannens view yetnikoff was probably overcompensating for his naturally sensitive and generous personality and that he had little hope of being recognised as a record man someone with a musical ear and an intuitive understanding of current trends and artists intentions because he was tonedeaf so he instead determined to become a colourful character47 yetnikoff soon became notorious for his violent temper and regular tantrums he shattered glassware spewed a mixture of yiddish and barnyard epithets and had people physically ejected from the cbs building48 in 1976 columbia records of canada was renamed cbs records canada ltd30 the columbia label continued to be used by cbs canada but the cbs label was introduced for frenchlanguage recordings on may 5 1979 columbia masterworks began digital recording in a recording session

this template message cbs records had a popular roster of musicians it distributed philadelphia international records blue sky records the isley brothers tneck records and monument records from 1971 to 1976 but the music industry was in financial decline total sales fell by 11 the biggest drop since world war ii in 1979 cbs had a pretax income of 51 million and sales of over 1 billion the label laid off hundreds of employees to deal with the crisis ceo john backe promoted dick asher from vice president of business affairs to deputy president charged with cutting costs and restoring profits asher was reportedly reluctant to take on the role he was worried that yetnikoff would resent his promotion but backe had confidence in ashers experience in 1972 asher had turned the british division of cbs from loss to profit backe considered him to be honest and trustworthy and he appealed to ashers loyalty to the company employees at cbs thought asher was a bore and an interloper he cut back on expenses and on perks like limousines and restaurants his relationship with yetnikoff deteriorated asher became increasingly concerned about the huge and rapidly growing cost of hiring independent agents who were paid to promote new singles to radio station program directors indies had been used by record labels for many years to promote new releases but as he methodically delved into cbs records expenses asher was dismayed to discover that hiring these independent promoters was now costing cbs alone as much as 10 million per year when asher took over cbs uk division in 1972 a freelance promoter might only charge 100 per week but by 1979 the top american independent promoters had organized themselves into a loose collective known as the network and their fees were now running into the tens millions of dollars per year music historian frederic dannen estimates that by 1980 the major labels were paying anywhere from to 100000 to 300000 per song to the network promoters and that it was costing the industry as whole as much as 80 million annually during this period columbia scored a top 40 hit with the pink floyd single another brick in the wall and its parent album the wall would spend four months at no 1 on the billboard lp chart in early 1980 but few in the industry knew that dick asher was in fact using the single as a covert experiment to test the extent of the pernicious influence of the network by not paying them to promote the new pink floyd single the results were immediate and deeply troubling not one of the major radio stations in los angeles would program the record despite the fact that the group was in town performing sellout shows to rave reviews asher was already worried about the growing power of the network and the fact it operated entirely outside the control of the label but he was profoundly dismayed to realize that the network was in effect a huge extortion racket and that the operation could well be linked to organized crime a concern vehemently dismissed by yetnikoff who resolutely defended the indies and declared them to be mensches but dick asher now knew that the networks real power lay in their ability to prevent records from being picked up by radio and as an experienced media lawyer and a loyal cbs employee he was also acutely aware that this could become a new payola scandal which had the potential to engulf the entire cbs corporation and that the federal communications commission could even revoke cbs allimportant broadcast licenses if the corporation was found to be involved in any illegality49 the 1980s and sale to sonyedit the structure of us columbia remained the same until 1980 when it spun off the classicalbroadway unit columbia masterworks records into a separate imprint

with bringing back the notes and mike logo but without the cbs mark on the microphone that logo is currently used in the columbia jazz series of jazz releases and reissues57 a modified magic notes logo is found on the logo for sony classical in mid to late 1999 it was eventually decided that the walking eye previously the cbs records logo outside north america would be columbias logo with the

this studio to make one of the earliest jazz records by the original dixieland jass band6061 columbia 30th street studio in new york city columbia records had some of the most highly regarded sound recording studios including the columbia 30th street studio at 207 east 30th street studio c and studio d the cbs studio building at 49 east 52nd street studio b on the second floor and studio e on the sixth floor and one of their earliest recording studios studio a at 799 7th avenue near 52nd street62 the columbia 30th street studio at 207 east 30th streets nicknamed the church was considered by some in the music industry to be the bestsounding room of its time and many consider it to have been the greatest recording studio in history62 the 1875 building located in manhattans murray hill district had been originally constructed as a christian church it was used by several denominations over the next seventy years then briefly became a radio studio in the late 1940s before being leased by cbs in 1952 and converted into a stateoftheart recording studio the 30th street studio had unique sonic characteristics thanks to its soaring onehundredfoot vaulted ceiling exposed timber beams plaster walls and unvarnished wooden floor when columbia took over the property then head of ar mitch miller a musician himself immediately recognised its singular acoustic properties and declared that the hall was to be left untouched by human hands he posted detailed standing orders to all staff to control the maintenance and cleaning of the space even down to the changing of light bulbs ordering that the curtains and other fittings were never to be touched that no painting was allowed and especially that the wooden floor could only be swept or vacuumed and was never under any circumstances to be mopped with water for fear that this might alter the rooms distinctive resonant and reflective properties63 unfortunately cbs never took up the option to buy the building and it gave up its lease and closed the studio in 1982 tragically in spite of the buildings inherent heritage status and its vast cultural significance it was sold to developers in 1985 demolished and replaced by a nondescript highrise apartment complex liederkranz hall studio columbia also recorded in the highly respected liederkranz hall at 111 east 58th street between park and lexington avenues in new york city a building built by and formerly belonging to a german cultural and musical society the liederkranz society and used as a recording studio victor also used this hall as a recording studio in the late 1920s62646566 the producer morty palitz had been instrumental in convincing columbia records to begin to use the liederkranz hall studio for recording music additionally convincing the conductor andre kostelanetz to make some of the first recordings in liederkranz hall which until then had only been used for cbs symphony radio shows67 in the late 1940s the large liederkranz hall
