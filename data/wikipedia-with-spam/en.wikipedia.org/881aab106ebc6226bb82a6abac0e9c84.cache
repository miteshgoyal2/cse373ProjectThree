will always love you 1992 a song written by dolly parton and one of houstons mostrecognised and best selling singles worldwide i will always love you prominently uses melismas problems playing this file see media help houston was a mezzosoprano282283 and was commonly referred to as the voice in reference to her exceptional vocal talent284 she was third in mtvs list of 22 greatest voices285 and sixth on online magazine coves list of the 100 best pop vocalists with a score of 48550286 jon pareles of the new york times stated she always had a great big voice a technical marvel from its velvety depths to its ballistic middle register to its ringing and airy heights287 in 2008 rolling stone listed houston as the thirtyfourth of the 100 greatest singers of all time stating her voice is a mammoth coruscating cry few vocalists could get away with opening a song with 45 unaccompanied seconds of singing but houstons powerhouse version of dolly partons i will always love you is a tour de force103 matthew perpetua from rolling stone also eulogized houstons vocal enumerating ten performances including how will i know from the 1986 mtv vmas and the star spangled banner at the 1991 super bowl whitney houston was blessed with an astonishing vocal range and extraordinary technical skill but what truly made her a great singer was her ability to connect with a song and drive home its drama and emotion with incredible precision he stated she was a brilliant performer and her live shows often eclipsed her studio recordings288 jon caramanica of the new york times commented her voice was clean and strong with barely any grit well suited to the songs of love and aspiration hers was a voice of triumph and achievement and it made for any number of stunning timestopping vocal performances289 mariah carey stated she whitney has a really rich strong midbelt that very few people have she sounds really good really strong290 while in her review of i look to you music critic ann powers of the los angeles times writes houstons voice stands like monuments upon the landscape of 20th century pop defining the architecture of their times sheltering the dreams of millions and inspiring the climbing careers of countless imitators adding when she was at her best nothing could match her huge clean cool mezzosoprano283 lauren everitt from bbc news magazine commented on melisma used in houstons recording and its influence an early i in whitney houstons i will always love you takes nearly six seconds to sing in those seconds the former gospel singerturnedpop star packs a series of different notes into the single syllable stated everitt the technique is repeated throughout the song most pronouncedly on every i and you the vocal technique is called melisma and it has inspired a host of imitators other artists may have used it before houston but it was her rendition of dolly partons love song that pushed the technique into the mainstream in the 90s but perhaps what houston nailed best was moderation everitt said that in a climate of reality shows ripe with oversinging its easy to appreciate houstons ability to save melisma for just the right moment291 houstons vocal stylings have had a significant impact on the music industry according to linda lister in divafication the deification of modern female pop stars she has been called the queen of pop for her influence during the 1990s commercially rivaling mariah carey and celine dion292 stephen holden from the new york times in his review of houstons radio city music hall concert on july 20 1993 praised her attitude as a singer writing whitney houston is one of the few contemporary pop stars of whom it might be said the voice suffices while almost every performer whose albums sell in the millions calls upon an entertainers bag of tricks from telling jokes to dancing to circus pyrotechnics ms houston would rather just stand there and sing with regard to her singing style he added her houstons stylistic trademarks – shivery melismas that ripple up in the middle of a song twirling embellishments at the ends of phrases that suggest an almost breathless exhilaration – infuse her interpretations with flashes of musical and emotional lightning293 elysa gardner of the los angeles times in her review for the preachers wife soundtrack praised houstons vocal ability highly commenting she is first and foremost a pop diva – at that the best one we have no other female pop star – not mariah carey not celine dion not barbra streisand – quite rivals houston in her exquisite vocal fluidity and purity of tone and her ability to infuse a lyric with mesmerizing melodrama294 influence during the 1980s mtv was coming into its own and received criticism for not playing enough videos by black artists with michael jackson breaking down the color barrier for black men houston did the same for black women she became the first black woman to receive heavy rotation on the network following the success of the how will i know video295 following houstons breakthrough other africanamerican women such as janet jackson and anita baker were successful in popular music5455 baker commented that because of what whitney and sade did there was an opening for me for radio stations black women singers arent taboo anymore296 allmusic noted her contribution to the success of black artists on the pop scene commenting houston was able to handle big adult contemporary ballads effervescent stylish dancepop and slick urban contemporary soul with equal dexterity and that the result was an acrosstheboard appeal that was matched by scant few artists of her era and helped her become one of the first black artists to find success on mtv in michael jacksons wake297 the new york times stated that houston was a major catalyst for a movement within black music that recognized the continuity of soul pop jazz and gospel vocal traditions298 richard corliss of time magazine commented on her initial success breaking various barriers of her first albums ten cuts six were ballads this chanteuse houston had to fight for air play with hard rockers the young lady had to stand uncowed in the locker room of macho rock the soul strutter had to seduce a music audience that anointed few black artists with superstardom she was a phenomenon waiting to happen a canny tapping of the listeners yen for a return to the musical middle and because every new star creates her own genre her success has helped other blacks other women other smooth singers find an avid reception in the pop marketplace299 stephen holden of the new york times said that houston revitalized the tradition of strong gospeloriented popsoul singing300 ann powers of the los angeles times referred to the singer as a national treasure283 jon caramanica another music critic of the new york times called houston rbs great modernizer adding slowly but surely reconciling the ambition and praise of the church with the movements and needs of the body and the glow of the mainstream289 he also drew comparisons between houstons influence and other big names on 1980s pop she was alongside michael jackson and madonna one of the crucial figures to hybridize pop in the 1980s though her strategy was far less radical than that of her peers jackson and madonna were by turns lascivious and brutish and crucially willing to let their production speak more loudly than their voices an option ms houston never went for also she was less prolific than either of them achieving most of her renown on the strength of her first three solo albums and one soundtrack released from 1985 to 1992 if she was less influential than they were in the years since it was only because her gift was so rare so impossible to mimic jackson and madonna built worldviews around their voices ms houston’s voice was the worldview she was someone more to be admired like a museum piece than to be emulated289 the independents music critic andy gill also wrote about houstons influence on modern rb and singing competitions comparing it to michael jacksons because whitney more than any other single artist – michael jackson included – effectively mapped out the course of modern rb setting the bar for standards of soul vocalese and creating the original template for what we now routinely refer to as the soul diva stated gill jackson was a hugely talented icon certainly but he will be as well remembered probably more so for his presentational skills his dazzling dance moves as for his musical innovations whitney on the other hand just sang and the ripples from her voice continue to dominate the pop landscape gill said that there are few if any jackson imitators on todays tv talent shows but every other contestant is a whitney wannabe desperately attempting to emulate that wondrous combination of vocal effects – the flowing melisma the soaring mezzosoprano confidence the tremulous fluttering that carried the ends of lines into realms of higher yearning301 houston was considered by many to be a singers singer who had an influence on countless other vocalists both female and male103302 similarly steve huey from allmusic wrote that the shadow of houstons prodigious technique still looms large over nearly every pop diva and smooth urban soul singer – male or female – in her wake and spawned a legion of imitators297 rolling stone on her biography stated that houston redefined the image of a female soul icon and inspired singers ranging from mariah carey to rihanna303 essence ranked houston sixth on their list of 50 most influential rb stars of all time calling her the diva to end all divas304 a number of artists have acknowledged houston as an influence including celine dion305 mariah carey103 toni braxton306 lady gaga307 christina aguilera308 leann rimes309 jessica simpson310 nelly furtado311 kelly clarkson312 britney spears313 ciara314 pnk313 aneeka315 ashanti316 robin thicke317 jennifer hudson318 stacie orrico319 amerie320 destinys child313321 and ariana grande322 mariah carey who was often compared to houston said she houston has been a big influence on me323 she later told usa today that none of us would sound the same if aretha franklin hadnt ever put out a record or whitney houston hadnt324 celine dion who was the third member of the troika that dominated female pop singing in the 1990s did a telephone interview with good morning america on february 13 2012 saying whitneys been an amazing inspiration for me ive been singing with her my whole career actually i wanted to have a career like hers sing like her look beautiful like her325 beyoncé told the globe and mail that houston inspired her to get up there and do what she did326 she also wrote on her website on the day after houstons death i like every singer always wanted to be just like houston her voice was perfect strong but soothing soulful and classic her vibrato
