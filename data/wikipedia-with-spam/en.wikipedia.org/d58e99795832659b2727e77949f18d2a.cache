of styles of contemporary videomaking techniques including animation live action filming documentaries and nonnarrative approaches such as abstract film some music videos blend different styles such as animation music and live action combining these styles and techniques has become more popular because of the variation it presents to the audience many music videos interpret images and scenes from the songs lyrics while others take a more thematic approach other music videos may be without a set concept being merely a filmed version of the songs live performance2 contents 1 history and

fleischer introduced a series of singalong short cartoons called screen songs which invited audiences to sing along to popular songs by following the bouncing ball which is similar to a modern karaoke machine early 1930s cartoons featured popular musicians performing their hit songs oncamera in liveaction segments during the cartoons the early animated films by walt disney such as the silly symphonies shorts and especially fantasia which featured several interpretations of classical pieces were built around music the warner brothers cartoons even today billed as looney tunes and merrie

jordan made short films for his songs some of which were spliced together into a feature film lookout sister these films were according to music historian donald clarke the ancestors of music video4 musicals of the 1950s led to shortform music videos musical films were another important precursor to music video and several wellknown music videos have imitated the style of classic hollywood musicals from the 1930s to the 1950s one of the bestknown examples is madonnas 1985 video for material girl directed by mary lambert5 which was closely modelled on jack coles staging of diamonds are a girls best friend from the film gentlemen prefer blondes several of michael jacksons videos show the unmistakable influence of the dance sequences in classic hollywood musicals including the landmark thriller and the martin scorsesedirected bad which was influenced by the stylised dance fights in the film version of west side story6 according to the internet accuracy project disc jockey–singer j p the big bopper richardson was the first to coin the phrase music video in 19597 1950s early music clipsedit in his autobiography tony bennett claims to have created the first music video when he was filmed walking along the serpentine in hyde park london in 1956 with the resulting clip being set to his recording of the song stranger in paradise8 the clip was sent to uk and us television stations and aired on shows including dick clarks american bandstand9 the oldest example of a promotional music video with similarities to more abstract modern videos seems to be the czech dáme si do bytu lets get to the apartment created in 1958 and directed by ladislav rychman1011 1960–1973 promotional clips and othersedit in the late 1950s12 the scopitone a visual jukebox was invented in france and short films were produced by many french artists such as serge gainsbourg françoise hardy jacques dutronc and the belgian jacques brel to accompany their songs its use spread to other countries and similar machines such as the cinebox in italy and colorsonic in the usa were patented12 in 1961 for the canadian show singalong jubilee manny pittson began prerecording the music audio went onlocation and taped various visuals with the musicians lipsynching then edited the audio and video together most music numbers were taped instudio on stage and the location shoot videos were to add variety13 in 1964 kenneth angers experimental short film scorpio rising used popular songs instead of dialog in 1964 the moody blues producer alex murray wanted to promote his version of go now the short film clip he produced and directed to promote the single has a striking visual style that predates queens similar bohemian rhapsody video by a full decade it also predates what the beatles did with promotional films of their singles rain and paperback writer both released in 1966 in the same year the beatles starred in their first feature film a hard days night directed by richard lester shot in blackandwhite and presented as a mock documentary it interspersed comedic and dialogue sequences with musical tones the musical sequences furnished basic templates on which countless subsequent music videos were modeled it was the direct model for the successful us tv series the monkees 1966–1968 which similarly consisted of film segments that were created to accompany various monkees songs14 the beatles second feature help 1965 was a much more lavish affair filmed in colour in london and on international locations the title track sequence filmed in blackandwhite is arguably one of the prime archetypes of the modern performancestyle music video employing rhythmic crosscutting contrasting long shots and closeups and unusual shots and camera angles such as the shot 50 seconds into the song in which george harrisons left hand and the neck of his guitar are seen in sharp focus in the foreground while the completely outoffocus figure of john lennon sings in the background in 1965 the beatles began making promotional clips then known as filmed inserts for distribution and broadcast in other countries—primarily the usa—so they could promote their record releases without having to make inperson appearances their first batch of promo videos recorded in late 1965 including their thencurrent single day tripperwe can work it out were fairly straightforward mimedinstudio performance pieces albeit sometimes in silly sets and meant to blend in fairly seamlessly with television shows like top of the pops and hullabaloo by the time the beatles stopped touring in late 1966 their promotional films like their recordings had become highly sophisticated in may 1966 they filmed two sets of colour promotional clips for their current single rainpaperback writer all directed by michael lindsayhogg15 who went on to direct the rolling stones rock and roll circus and the beatles final film let it be the colour promotional clips for strawberry fields forever and penny lane made in early 1967 and directed by peter goldman16 took the promotional film format to a new level they used techniques borrowed from underground and avant garde film including reversed film and slow motion dramatic lighting unusual camera angles and color filtering added in postproduction at the end of 1967 the group released their third film the one hour madefortelevision project magical mystery tour it was written and directed by the group and first broadcast on the bbc on boxing day 1967 although poorly received at the time for lacking a narrative structure it showed the group to be accomplished music video makers in their own right the beatles in help concert films were being released in the mid1960s at least as early as 1964 with the tami show the monochrome 1966 clip for bob dylans subterranean homesick blues filmed by d a pennebaker was featured in pennebakers dylan film documentary dont look back eschewing any attempt to simulate performance or present a narrative the clip shows dylan standing in a city back alley silently shuffling a series of large cue cards bearing key words from the songs lyrics many filmed inserts were produced by uk artists so they could be screened on tv when the bands were not available to appear live pink floyd were pioneers in producing promotional films for their songs including san francisco film directed by anthony stern scarecrow arnold layne and interstellar overdrive the latter directed by peter whitehead who also made several pioneering clips for the rolling stones between 1966 and 1968 in the uk the kinks made one of the first plot promo clips for a song for their single dead end street 1966 a miniature comic movie was made the bbc reportedly refused to air the clip because it was considered to be in poor taste17 the who featured in several promotional clips in this period beginning with their 1965 clip for i cant explain their plot clip for happy jack 1966 shows the band acting like a gang of thieves the promo film to call me lightning 1968 tells a story of how drummer keith moon came to join the group the other three band members are having tea inside what looks like an abandoned hangar when suddenly a bleeding box arrives out of which jumps a fastrunning time lapse moon that the other members subsequently try to get a hold of in a spedup slapstick chasing sequence to wind him down in 1966 nancy sinatra filmed a music video for her song these boots are made for walkin roy orbison appeared in promotional clips such as his 1968 hit walk on18 the rolling stones appeared in many promotional clips for their songs in the 1960s in 1966 peter whitehead directed two promo clips for their single have you seen your mother baby standing in the shadow19 in 1967 whitehead directed a plot clip colour promo clip for the stones single we love you which first aired in august 196720 this clip featured spedup footage of the group recording in the studio intercut with a mock trial that clearly alludes to the drug prosecutions of mick jagger and keith richards underway at that time jaggers girlfriend marianne faithfull appears in the trial scenes and presents the judge richards with what may be the infamous fur rug that had featured so prominently in the press reports of the drug bust at richards house in early 1967 when it is pulled back it reveals an apparently naked jagger with chains around his ankles the clip concludes with scenes of the stones in the studio intercut with footage that had previously been used in the concert version promo clip for have you seen your mother baby the group also filmed a colour promo clip for the song 2000 light years from home from their album their satanic majesties request directed by michael lindsayhogg19 in 1968 michael lindsayhogg directed three clips for their single jumpin jack flash child of the moon—a colour clip for child of the moon and two different clips for jumpin jack flash in 1968 they collaborated with jeanluc godard on the film sympathy for the devil which mixed godards politics with documentary footage of the songs evolution during recording sessions during late 1972–73 david bowie featured in a series of promotional films directed by pop photographer mick rock who worked extensively with bowie in this period rock directed and edited four clips to promote four consecutive david bowie singles—john im only dancing may 1972 the jean genie nov 1972 the december 1972 us rerelease of space oddity and the 1973 release of the single life on mars lifted from bowies earlier album hunky dory the clip for john im only dancing was made with a budget of just us200 and filmed at the afternoon rehearsal for bowies rainbow theatre concert on august 19 1972 it shows bowie and band miming to the record intercut with footage of bowies dancers the astronettes dancing on stage and behind a backlit screen the clip was turned down by the bbc who reportedly found the homosexual overtones of the film distasteful although top of the pops replaced it with footage of bikers and a dancer21 the jean genie clip produced for just us350 was shot in one day and edited in less than two days it intercuts footage of bowie and band in concert with contrasting footage of the group in a photographic studio wearing black stage outfits and standing against a white background it also includes location footage with bowie and cyrinda foxe a mainman employee and a friend of david and angie bowie shot in san francisco outside the famous mars hotel with fox posing provocatively in the street while bowie lounges against the wall smoking22 country music also picked up on the trend of promotional clips to go along with songs sam lovullo the producer of the television series hee haw said his show presented what were in reality the first musical videos23 while jmi records made the same claim with don williams 1973 song the shelter of your eyes24 country music historian bob millard wrote that jmi had pioneered the country music video concept by producing a 3minute film to go along with williams song24 lovullo said his videos were conceptualized by having the shows staff go to nearby rural areas and film animals and farmers before editing the footage to fit the storyline of a particular song the video material was a very workable production item for the show he wrote it provided picture stories for songs however some of our guests felt the videos took attention away from their live performances which they hoped would promote record sales if they had a hit song they didnt want to play it under comic barnyard footage the concepts mixed reaction eventually spelled an end to the video concept on hee haw23 promotional videos of country music songs however continued to be produced 1974–1980 beginnings of music televisionedit the australian tv shows countdown and sounds both of which premiered in 1974 were significant in developing and popularizing the music video genre in australia and other countries and in establishing the importance of music video clips as a means of promoting both emerging acts and new releases by established acts in early 1974 former radio dj graham webb launched a weekly teenoriented tv music show which screened on sydneys atn7 on saturday mornings this was renamed sounds unlimited in 1975 and later shortened simply to sounds in need of material for the show webb approached seven newsroom staffer russell mulcahy and asked him to shoot film footage to accompany popular songs for which there were no purposemade clips eg harry nilssons everybodys talkin using this method webb and mulcahy assembled a collection of about 25 clips for the show the success of his early efforts encouraged mulcahy to quit his tv job and become a fulltime director and he made clips for several popular australian acts including stylus marcia hines hush and acdc25 as it gained popularity countdown talent coordinator ian molly meldrum and producer michael shrimpton quickly realized that film clips were becoming an important new commodity in music marketing despite the shows minuscule budget countdowns original director paul drane was able to create several memorable music videos especially for the show including the classic filmclips for the acdc hits its a long way to the top if you wanna rock n roll and jailbreak25 after relocating to the uk in the mid1970s mulcahy made successful music videos for several noted british pop acts—his early uk credits included xtcs making plans for nigel 1979 and his landmark video for the buggles video killed the radio star 1979 which became the first music video played on mtv in 198126 in 1975 the british rock band queen employed bruce gowers to make a promotional video to show their new single bohemian rhapsody on the bbc music series top of the pops according to rock historian paul fowles the song is widely credited as the first global hit single for which an accompanying video was central to the marketing strategy27 rolling stone has said of bohemian rhapsody its influence cannot be overstated practically inventing the music video seven years before mtv went on the air28 video concert hall created by jerry crowe and charles henderson and launched on november 1 1979 was the first nationwide video music programming on american television predating mtv by almost three years29303132 the usa cable network program night flight was one of the first american programs to showcase these videos as an art form david bowies ashes to ashes became the first music video to have a production cost over 500000 1980 in 1980 the music video to david bowies ashes to ashes became the most expensive ever made having a production cost of 582000 1671487 in 2016 the first music video to have a production cost of over 50000033 the video was made in solarised color with stark blackandwhite scenes and was filmed in multiple locations including a padded room and a rocky shore34 the video became one of the most iconic ever made at the time and its complex nature is seen as significant in the evolution of the music video the same year the new zealand group split enz had major success with the single i got you and the album true colours and later that year they produced a complete set of promo clips for each song on the album directed by their percussionist noel crombie and to market these on video cassette this was followed a year later by the first american video album the completion backward principle by the tubes directed by the groups keyboard player michael cotten which included two videos directed by russell mulcahy talk to ya later and dont want to wait anymore35 among the first music videos were clips produced by exmonkee michael nesmith who started making short musical films for saturday night live14 in 1981 he released elephant parts the first winner of a grammy for music video directed by william dear billboard credits 29 the independently produced video concert hall as being the first with nationwide video music programming on american television303132 1981–1991 music videos go mainstreamedit in 1981 the us video channel mtv launched airing video killed the radio star and beginning an era of 24houraday music on television with this new outlet for material the music video would by the mid1980s grow to play a central role in popular music marketing many important acts of this period most notably adam and the ants duran duran and madonna owed a great deal of their success to the skillful construction and seductive appeal of their videos two key innovations in the development of the modern music video were the development of relatively inexpensive and easytouse video recording and editing equipment and the development of visual effects created with techniques such as image compositingcitation needed the advent of highquality color videotape recorders and portable video cameras coincided with the diy ethos of the new wave eracitation needed enabling many pop acts to produce promotional videos quickly and cheaply in comparison to the relatively high costs of using film however as the genre developed music video directors increasingly turned to 35 mm film as the preferred medium while others mixed film and video during the 1980s music videos had become de rigueur for most recording artists the phenomenon was famously parodied by bbc television comedy program not the nine oclock news who produced a spoof music video nice video shame about the song in this period directors and the acts they worked with began to explore and expand the form and style of the genre using more sophisticated effects in their videos mixing film and video and adding a storyline or plot to the music video occasionally videos were made in a nonrepresentational form in which the musical artist was not shown because music videos are mainly intended to promote the artist such videos are comparatively rare three early 1980s examples are bruce springsteens atlantic city directed by arnold levine david mallets video for david bowie and queens under pressure and ian emes video for duran durans the chauffeur one notable later example of the nonrepresentational style is bill konersmans innovative 1987 video for princes sign o the times36 – influenced by dylans subterranean homesick blues clip it featured only the text of the songs lyrics in the early 1980s music videos also began to explore political and social themes examples include the music videos for david bowies china girl and lets dance 1983 which both explored race issues37 in an 1983 interview bowie spoke about the importance of using music videos in addressing social issues lets try to use the video format as a platform for some kind of social observation and not just waste it on trotting out and trying to enhance the public image of the singer involved38 in 1983 the most successful influential and iconic music video of all time was released the nearly 14minutelong video for michael jacksons song thriller directed by john landis the video set new standards for production having cost us800000 to film3940 the video for thriller along with earlier videos by jackson for his songs billie jean and beat it were instrumental in getting music videos by african american artists played on mtv prior to jacksons success videos by africanamerican artists were rarely played on mtv according to mtv this was because it initially conceived itself as a rockmusicoriented channel although musician rick james was outspoken in his criticism of the cable channel claiming in 1983 that mtvs refusal to air the music video for his song super freak and clips by other africanamerican performers was blatant racism41 on march 5 1983 country music television or cmt was launched42 created and founded by glenn d daniels and uplinked from the video world productions facility in hendersonville tennessee the muchmusic music channel was launched in canada in 1984 in 1984 mtv also launched the mtv video music awards later to be known as the vmas an annual awards event that would come to underscore mtvs importance in the music industry the inaugural event rewarded the beatles and david bowie with the video vanguard award for their work in pioneering the music video in 1985 mtv launched the channel vh1 then known as vh1 video hits one featuring softer music and meant to cater to an older demographic than mtv mtv europe was launched in 1987 and mtv asia in 1991 another important development in music videos was the launch of the chart show on the uks channel 4 in 1986 this was a program which consisted entirely of music videos the only outlet many videos had on british tv at the timecitation needed without presenters instead the videos were linked by then state of the art computer graphics the show moved to itv in 1989 the video for the 1985 dire straits song money for nothing made pioneering use of computer animation and helped make the song an international hit ironically the song itself was a wry comment on the musicvideo phenomenon sung from the point of view of an appliance deliveryman both drawn to and repelled by the outlandish images and personalities that appeared on mtv in 1986 peter gabriels song sledgehammer used special effects and animation techniques developed by british studio aardman animation the video for sledgehammer would go on to be a phenomenal success43 and win nine mtv video music awards in 1988 the mtv show yo mtv raps debuted the show helped to bring hip hop music to a mass audience for the first time 1992–2004 rise of the directorsedit in november 1992 mtv began listing directors with the artist and song credits reflecting the fact that music videos had increasingly become an auteurs medium directors such as chris cunningham michel gondry spike jonze floria sigismondi44 stéphane sednaoui mark romanek and hype williams all got their start around this time all brought a unique vision and style to the videos they directed some of these directors including gondry jonze sigismondi45 and f gary gray went on to direct feature films this continued a trend that had begun earlier with directors such as lasse hallström and david fincher two of the videos directed by romanek in 1995 are notable for being two of the three most expensive music videos of all time michael and janet jacksons scream which allegedly cost 7 million to produce and madonnas bedtime story which cost a reported 5 million from this scream is the most expensive video to date in the mid to late 1990s walter stern directed firestarter by the prodigy bitter sweet symphony by the verve and teardrop by massive attack4647 during this period mtv launched channels around the world to show music videos produced in each local market mtv latin america in 1993 mtv india in 1996 and mtv mandarin in 1997 among others mtv2 originally called m2 and meant to show more alternative and older music videos debuted in 1996 from 1991 to 2001 billboard had its own music video awards 2005–present the internet becomes videofriendlyedit the website ifilm which hosted short videos including music videos launched its service in 1997 napster a peertopeer file sharing service which ran between 1999 and 2001 enabled users to share video files including those for music videos by the mid2000s mtv and many of its sister channels had largely abandoned showing music videos in favor of reality television shows which were more popular with its audiences and which mtv had itself helped to pioneer with the show the real world which premiered in 1992 2005 saw the launch of the website youtube which made the viewing of online video much faster and easier google videos yahoo video facebook and myspaces video functionality use similar technology such websites had a profound effect on the viewing of music videos some artists began to see success as a result of videos seen mostly or entirely online the band ok go may exemplify this trend having achieved fame through the videos for two of their songs a million ways in 2005 and here it goes again in 2006 both of which first became wellknown online ok go repeated the trick with another highconcept video in 2010 for their song this too shall pass the 2008 video for weezers pork and beans also captured this trend by including at least 20 youtube celebrities the single became the most successful of weezers career in chart performance in 2007 the riaa issued ceaseanddesist letters to youtube users to prevent single users from sharing videos which are the property of the music labels after its merger with google youtube assured the riaa that they would find a way to pay royalties through a bulk agreement with the major record labelscitation needed this was complicated by the fact that not all labels share the same policy toward music videos some welcome the development and upload music videos to various online outlets themselves viewing music videos as free advertising for their artists while other labels view music videos not as an advertisement but as the product itself in 2009 thirty seconds to mars music video kings and queens was uploaded to youtube on the same day of its release where it has garnered over one hundred million views48 it also received over forty million plays on myspace kings and queens was featured as itunes store video of the week and was one of the most downloaded videos ever to be featured48 the video also received four nominations at the 2010 mtv video music awards making 30 seconds to mars the most nominated rock artist in vma history for a single year49 mtv itself now provides streams of artists music videos while aols recently launched aol music features a vast collection of advertising supported streaming videos the internet has become the primary growth income market for record companyproduced music videoscitation needed at its launch apples itunes store provided a section of free music videos in high quality compression to be watched via the itunes application more recently the itunes store has begun selling music videos for use on apples ipod with video playback capability to further signify the change in direction towards music video airplay mtv officially dropped the music television tagline on february 8 2010 from their logo in response to their increased commitment to nonscripted reality programming and other youthoriented entertainment rising in prominence on their live broadcast50 vevo is a music video website launched by several major music publishers in december 200951 the videos on vevo are syndicated to youtube with google and vevo sharing the advertising revenue52 official lofi internet music clipsedit following the shift toward internet broadcasting and the rising popularity of usergenerated video sites such as youtube around 2006 various independent filmmakers began recording live sessions to present on the web examples of this new way of creating and presenting a music video include vincent moons work with the takeaway shows in the van sessions a similar platform53 and the dutch vpro 3voor12 which puts out music videos recorded in elevators and other small guerrilla filmmaking type locations in a similar tradition called behind54 all of these swiftly recorded clips are made with minimal budgets and share similar aesthetics with the lofi music movement of the early nineties offering freedom from the increasingly burdensome financial requirements of highproduction movielike clips it began as the only method for littleknown indie music artists to present themselves to a wider audience but increasingly this approach has been taken up by such major mainstream artists as rem and tom jones55 lyric videosedit a lyric video is one in which the words to the song are the main element of the video lyric videos rose to prominence in the 2010s with it becoming relatively easy for artists to disperse videos through websites such as youtube56 many do not even feature any visual related to the musician in question but merely a background with the lyrics appearing over them as they are sung in the song56 as such they are often created with relative ease and often act as a supplemental video to a more traditional music video despite its rise to prominence in the 2010s the idea had still been used much earlier the music video for rems fall on me interspersed the songs lyrics with abstract film footage in 1987 prince released a video for his song sign o the times the video featured the songs words pulsing to the music presented along with abstract geometric shapes an effect created by bill konersman5758 the following year the video for the talking heads single nothing but flowers consisted of the songs lyrics being set to various visuals in 1990 george michael released praying for time as a lyric video he had refused to make a traditional music video so his label released a simple clip that displayed the songs lyrics on a black screen59 censorshipedit see also sexuality in music videos as the concept and medium of a music video is a form of artistic expression artists have been on many occasions censored if their content is deemed offensive what may be considered offensive will differ in countries due to censorship laws and local customs and ethics in most cases the record label will provide and distribute videos edited or provide both censored and uncensored videos for an artist in some cases it has been known for music videos to be banned in their entirety as they have been deemed far too offensive to be broadcast 1980sedit the first video to be banned by mtv was queens 1982 hit body language due to thinly veiled homoerotic undertones plus lots of skin and sweat but apparently not enough clothing save that worn by the fully clothed members of queen themselves it was deemed unsuitable for a television audience at the time however the channel did air olivia newtonjohns 1981 video for the hit song physical which lavished camera time on male models working out in string bikinis who spurn her advances ultimately pairing off to walk to the mens locker rooms holding hands though the network ended the clip before the overt homosexual reveal ending in some airings the video for girls on film by duran duran which featured topless women mud wrestling and other depictions of sexual fetishes was banned by the bbc mtv did air the video albeit in a heavily edited form laura branigan initially protested an mtv request to edit her self control video in 1984 but relented when the network refused to air the william friedkindirected clip featuring the singer lured through an increasingly debauched if increasingly stylized series of nightclubs by a masked man who ultimately takes her to bed in 1989 chers if i could turn back time video where the singer performs the song in an extremely revealing body suit surrounded by a ship full of cheering sailors was restricted to latenight broadcasts on mtv the sex pistols video for god save the queen was banned by the bbc for calling the united kingdom a fascist regime mötley crües video for girls girls girls was banned by mtv for having completely nude women dancing around the members of the band in a strip club mötley crüe did make another version of the video that was accepted by mtv in 1983 entertainment tonight ran a segment on censorship and rock video violence60 the episode explored the impact of mtv rock video violence on the youth of the early 1980s excerpts from the music videos of michael jackson duran duran golden earring kiss kansas billy idol def leppard pat benatar and the rolling stones were shown dr thomas radecki of the national coalition on tv violence was interviewed accusing the fledgling rock video business of excessive violence night tracks producer tom lynch weighed in on the effects of the video violence controversy recording artists john cougar mellencamp gene simmons and paul stanley of kiss along with directors dominic orlando and julien temple provided a defense of their work the episodes conclusion was that the controversy will continue to grow some artists have used censorship as a publicity tool in the 1980s the show top of the pops was censorious in its approach to video content so some acts made videos that they knew would be censored using the resulting public controversy to promote their release examples of this tactic were duran durans aforementioned girls on film and frankie goes to hollywood with relax directed by bernard rose 1990sedit in 1991 the dance segment of michael jacksons black or white was cut because it showed michael jackson inappropriately touching himself in it michael jacksons most controversial video they dont care about us was banned from mtv vh1 and bbc because of the alleged antisemitic messages in the song and the visuals in the background of the prison version of the videocitation needed madonna is the artist most associated with music video censorship controversy surrounding madonnas marketing of her sexuality began with the video for lucky star and amplified over time due to clips such as

betamax andor video 8 laserdisc dvd and bluray in 1983 british synthpop band the human league released the first commercial video single called the human league video single78 on both vhs and betamax
