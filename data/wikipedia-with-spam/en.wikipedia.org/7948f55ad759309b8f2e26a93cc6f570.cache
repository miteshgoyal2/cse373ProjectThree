united states the only president in american history to serve two nonconsecutive terms in office 1885–89 and 1893–971 he won the popular vote for three presidential elections – in 1884 1888 and 1892 – and was one of two democrats with woodrow wilson to be elected president during the era of republican political domination dating from 1861 to 1933 cleveland was the leader of the probusiness bourbon democrats who opposed high tariffs free silver inflation imperialism and subsidies to business farmers or veterans on libertarian philosophical grounds his crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for american conservatives of the era2 cleveland won praise for his honesty selfreliance integrity and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism3 he fought political corruption patronage and bossism as a reformer cleveland had such prestige that the likeminded wing of the republican party called mugwumps largely bolted the gop presidential ticket and swung to his support in the 1884 election4 as his second administration began disaster hit the nation when the panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression which cleveland was unable to reverse it ruined his democratic party opening the way for a republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the democratic party in 1896 the result was a political realignment that ended the third party system and launched the fourth party system and the progressive era5 cleveland was a formidable policymaker and he also drew corresponding criticism his intervention in the pullman strike of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in illinois his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the democratic party6 critics complained that cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nations economic disasters—depressions and strikes—in his second term6 even so his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term biographer allan nevins wrote in grover cleveland the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities he had no endowments that thousands of men do not have he possessed honesty courage firmness independence and common sense but he possessed them to a degree other men do not7 today cleveland

stephen grover cleveland was born on march 18 1837 in caldwell new jersey to ann née neal and richard falley cleveland8 clevelands father was a congregational and presbyterian minister who was originally from connecticut9 his mother was from baltimore and was the daughter of a bookseller10 on his fathers side cleveland was descended from english ancestors the first of the family having emigrated to massachusetts from cleveland england in 163511 his fathers maternal grandfather richard falley jr fought at the battle of bunker hill and was the son of an immigrant from guernsey on his mothers side cleveland was descended from angloirish protestants and german quakers from philadelphia12 cleveland was distantly related to general moses cleaveland after whom the city of cleveland ohio was named13 cleveland the fifth of nine children was named stephen grover in honor of the first pastor of the first presbyterian church of caldwell where his father was pastor at the time he became known as grover in his adult life14 in 1841 the cleveland family moved to fayetteville new york where grover spent much of his childhood15 neighbors later described him as full of fun and inclined to play pranks16 and fond of outdoor sports17 in 1850 clevelands father moved to clinton oneida county new york to work as district secretary for the american home missionary society18 despite his fathers dedication to his missionary work the income was insufficient for the large family financial conditions forced him to remove grover from school into a twoyear mercantile apprenticeship in fayetteville the experience was valuable and brief and the living conditions quite austere grover returned to clinton and his schooling at the completion of the apprentice contract19 in 1853 when missionary work began to take a toll on his health clevelands father took an assignment in holland patent new york near utica and the family moved again20 shortly after he died from a gastric ulcer with grover reputedly hearing of his fathers death from a boy selling newspapers20 education and moving west an early undated photograph of grover cleveland cleveland received his elementary education at the fayetteville academy and the clinton liberal academy21 after his father died in 1853 he again left school so as to help support his family later that year clevelands brother william was hired as a teacher at the new york institute for the blind in new york city and william obtained a place for cleveland as an assistant teacher he returned home to holland patent at the end of 1854 where an elder in his church offered to pay for his college education if he would promise to become a minister cleveland declined and in 1855 he decided to move west22 he stopped first in buffalo new york where his uncle lewis f allen gave him a clerical job23 allen was an important man in buffalo and he introduced his nephew to influential men there including the partners in the law firm of rogers bowen and rogers24 millard fillmore the 13th president of the united states had previously worked for the partnership25 cleveland later took a clerkship with the firm began to read the law and was admitted to the new york bar in 185926 early career and the civil war cleveland worked for the rogers firm for three years then left in 1862 to start his own practice27 in january 1863 he was appointed assistant district attorney of erie county28 with the american civil war raging congress passed the conscription act of 1863 requiring ablebodied men to serve in the army if called upon or else to hire a substitute26 cleveland chose the latter course paying 150 to george benninsky a thirtytwoyearold polish immigrant to serve in his place29 as a lawyer cleveland became known for his singleminded concentration and dedication to hard work30 in 1866 he successfully defended some participants in the fenian raid working on a pro bono basis free of charge31 in 1868 cleveland attracted professional attention for his winning defense of a libel suit against the editor of buffalos commercial advertiser32 during this time cleveland assumed a lifestyle of simplicity taking residence in a plain boarding house cleveland dedicated his growing income instead to the support of his mother and younger sisters33 while his personal quarters were austere cleveland enjoyed an active social life and the easygoing sociability of hotellobbies and saloons34 he shunned the circles of higher society of buffalo in which his uncles family traveled35 political career in new york sheriff of erie county statue of grover cleveland outside city hall in buffalo new york from his earliest involvement in politics cleveland aligned with the democratic party36 he had a decided aversion to republicans john fremont and abraham lincoln and the heads of the rogers law firm were solid democrats37 in 1865 he ran for district attorney losing narrowly to his friend and roommate lyman k bass the republican nominee30 in 1870 with the help of friend oscar folsom cleveland secured the democratic nomination for sheriff of erie county new york38 he won the election by a 303vote margin and took office on january 1 1871 at age 3339 while this new career took him away from the practice of law it was rewarding in other ways the fees were said to yield up to 40000 us800000 today40 over the twoyear term38 clevelands service as sheriff was unremarkable biographer rexford tugwell described the time in office as a waste for cleveland politically cleveland was aware of graft in the sheriffs office during his tenure and chose not to confront it41 a notable incident of his term took place on september 6 1872 when patrick morrissey was executed who had been convicted of murdering his mother42 as sheriff cleveland was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution or paying a deputy 10 to perform the task42 in spite of reservations about the hanging cleveland executed morrissey himself42 he hanged another murderer john gaffney on february 14 187343 after his term as sheriff ended cleveland returned to his law practice opening a firm with his friends lyman k bass and wilson s bissell44 elected to congress in 1872 bass did not spend much time at the firm but cleveland and bissell soon rose to the top of buffalos legal community45 up to that point clevelands political career had been honorable and unexceptional as biographer allan nevins wrote probably no man in the country on march 4 1881 had less thought than this limited simple sturdy attorney of buffalo that four years later he would be standing in washington and taking the oath as president of the united states46 it was during this period that cleveland began a relationship with a widow maria crofts halpin and later assumed responsibility for supporting her and a child born at the time the matter became a campaign issue for the gop in his first presidential campaign47 mayor of buffalo in the 1870s the municipal government in buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt with democratic and republican political machines cooperating to share the spoils of political office48 in 1881 the republicans nominated a slate of particularly disreputable machine politicians the democrats saw the opportunity to gain the votes of disaffected republicans by nominating a more honest candidate49 the party leaders approached cleveland and he agreed to run for mayor of buffalo provided that the rest of the ticket was to his liking50 when the more notorious politicians were left off the democratic ticket cleveland accepted the nomination50 cleveland was elected mayor with 15120 votes as against 11528 for milton c beebe his opponent51 he took office january 2 1882 clevelands term as mayor was spent fighting the entrenched interests of the party machines52 among the acts that established his reputation was a veto of the streetcleaning bill passed by the common council53 the streetcleaning contract was open for bids and the council selected the highest bidder at 422000 rather than the lowest of 100000 less because of the political connections of the bidder53 while this sort of bipartisan graft had previously been tolerated in buffalo mayor cleveland would have none of it his veto message said i regard it as the culmination of a most barefaced impudent and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people and to worse than squander the public money54 the council reversed itself and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder55 cleveland also asked the state legislature to form a commission to develop a plan to improve the sewer system in buffalo at a much lower cost than previously proposed locally this plan was successfully adopted56 for this and other actions safeguarding public funds clevelands reputation as a leader willing to purge government corruption began to spread beyond erie county57 governor of new york gubernatorial portrait of grover cleveland new york democratic party officials began to consider cleveland a possible nominee for governor58 daniel manning a party insider who admired clevelands record was instrumental in his candidacy59 with a split in the state republican party in 1882 the democratic party was considered to be at an advantage there were several contenders for that partys nomination58 the two leading democratic candidates were roswell p flower and henry w slocum their factions deadlocked and the convention could not agree on a nominee60 cleveland in third place on the first ballot picked up support in subsequent votes and emerged as the compromise choice61 the republican party remained divided against itself and in the general election cleveland emerged the victor with 535318 votes to republican nominee charles j folgers 34246462 clevelands margin of victory was at the time the largest in a contested new york election the democrats also picked up seats in both houses of the new york state legislature63 cleveland brought his opposition to needless spending to the governors office he promptly sent the legislature eight vetos in his first two months in office64 the first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on new york city elevated trains to five cents65 the bill had broad support because the trains owner jay gould was unpopular and his fare increases were widely denounced66 cleveland however saw the bill as unjust—gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again67 moreover cleveland believed that altering goulds franchise would violate the contract clause of the federal constitution67 despite the initial popularity of the farereduction bill the newspapers praised clevelands veto67 theodore roosevelt then a member of the assembly had reluctantly voted for the bill to which cleveland objected in a desire to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons68 after the veto roosevelt reversed himself as did many legislators and the veto was sustained68 clevelands defiance of political corruption won him popular acclaim and the enmity of the influential tammany hall organization in new york city69 tammany under its boss john kelly had disapproved of clevelands nomination as governor and their resistance intensified after cleveland openly opposed and prevented the reelection of their point man in the state senate thomas f grady70 cleveland also steadfastly opposed nominees of the tammanyites as well as bills passed as a result of their deal making71 the loss of tammanys support was offset by the support of theodore roosevelt and other reformminded republicans who helped cleveland to pass several laws reforming municipal governments72 election of 1884 main articles united states presidential election 1884 and grover cleveland presidential campaign 1884 nomination for president main article 1884 democratic national convention the republicans convened in chicago and nominated former speaker of the house james g blaine of maine for president on the fourth ballot blaines nomination alienated many republicans who viewed blaine as ambitious and immoral73 the gop standard bearer was weakened by alienating the mugwumps and the conkling faction recently disenfranchised by president arthur74 democratic party leaders saw the republicans choice as an opportunity to win the white house for the first time since 1856 if the right candidate could be found73 an antiblaine cartoon presents him as the tattooed man with many indelible scandals an anticleveland cartoon highlights the halpin scandal among the democrats samuel j tilden was the initial frontrunner having been the partys nominee in the contested election of 187675 after tilden declined a nomination due to his poor health his supporters shifted to several other contenders75 cleveland was among the leaders in early support and thomas f bayard of delaware allen g thurman of ohio samuel freeman miller of iowa and benjamin butler of massachusetts also had considerable followings along with various favorite sons75 each of the other candidates had hindrances to his nomination bayard had spoken in favor of secession in 1861 making him unacceptable to northerners butler conversely was reviled throughout the south for his actions during the civil war thurman was generally well liked but was growing old and infirm and his views on the silver question were uncertain76 cleveland too had detractors—tammany remained opposed to him—but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends77 cleveland led on the first ballot with 392 votes out of 82078 on the second ballot tammany threw its support behind butler but the rest of the delegates shifted to cleveland who won79 thomas a hendricks of indiana was selected as his running mate79 campaign against blaine corruption in politics was the central issue in 1884 indeed blaine had over the span of his career been involved in several questionable deals80 clevelands reputation as an opponent of corruption proved the democrats strongest asset81 william c hudson created clevelands contextual campaign slogan a public office is a public trust82 reformminded republicans called mugwumps denounced blaine as corrupt and flocked to cleveland83 the mugwumps including such men as carl schurz and henry ward beecher were more concerned with morality than with party and felt cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government83 at the same time the democrats gained support from the mugwumps they lost some bluecollar workers to the greenbacklabor party led by exdemocrat benjamin butler84 in general cleveland abided by the precedent of minimizing presidential campaign travel and speechmaking blaine became one of the first to break with that tradition85 the campaign focused on the candidates moral standards as each side cast aspersions on their opponents clevelands supporters rehashed the old allegations that blaine had corruptly influenced legislation in favor of the little rock and fort smith railroad and the union pacific railway later profiting on the sale of bonds he owned in both companies86 although the stories of blaines favors to the railroads had made the rounds eight years earlier this time blaines correspondence was discovered making his earlier denials less plausible86 on some of the most damaging correspondence blaine had written burn this letter giving democrats the last line to their rallying cry blaine blaine james g blaine the continental liar from the state of maine burn this letter87 regarding cleveland commentator jeff jacoby notes that not since george washington had a candidate for president been so renowned for his rectitude88 but the republicans found a refutation buried in clevelands past aided by the sermons of reverend george h ball a minister from buffalo they made public the allegation that cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child while he was a lawyer there89 with their rallies even subsequently including the chant ma ma wheres my pa90 when confronted with the scandal cleveland immediately instructed his supporters to above all tell the truth47 cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to maria crofts halpin the woman who asserted he had fathered her son oscar folsom cleveland and he assumed responsibility47 shortly before the 1884 election the republican media published an affidavit from halpin in which she stated that until she met cleveland her life was pure and spotless and there is not and never was a doubt as to the paternity of our child and the attempt of grover cleveland or his friends to couple the name of oscar folsom or any one else with that boy for that purpose is simply infamous and false91 results of the 1884 election the electoral votes of closely contested new york new jersey indiana and connecticut would determine the election92 in new york the tammany democrats decided that they would gain more from supporting a democrat they disliked than a republican who would do nothing for them93 blaine hoped that he would have more support from irish americans than republicans typically did while the irish were mainly a democratic constituency in the 19th century blaines mother was irish catholic and he had been supportive of the irish national land league while he was secretary of state94 the irish a significant group in three of the swing states did appear inclined to support blaine until a republican samuel d burchard gave a speech pivotal for the democrats denouncing them as the party of rum romanism and rebellion95 the democrats spread the word of this implied catholic insult on the eve of the election they also blistered blaine for attending a banquet with some of new york citys wealthiest men96 after the votes were counted cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states including new york by 1200 votes97 while the popular vote total was close with cleveland winning by just onequarter of a percent the electoral votes gave cleveland a majority of 219–18297 following the electoral victory the ma ma  attack phrase gained a classic riposte gone to the white house ha ha ha98 first term as president 1885–1889 reform cleveland portrayed as a tariff reformer soon after taking office cleveland was faced with the task of filling all the government jobs for which the president had the power of appointment these jobs were typically filled under the spoils system but cleveland announced that he would not fire any republican who was doing his job well and would not appoint anyone solely on the basis of party service99 he also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees as many departments had become bloated with political timeservers100 later in his term as his fellow democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils cleveland began to replace more of the partisan republican officeholders with democrats101 this was especially the case with policy making positions102 while some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns more of clevelands appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors administrations103 filecleveland groverpresident bep engraved portraitjpg bep engraved portrait of cleveland as president cleveland also reformed other parts of the government in 1887 he signed an act creating the interstate commerce commission104 he and secretary of the navy william c whitney undertook to modernize the navy and canceled construction contracts that had resulted in inferior ships105 cleveland angered railroad investors by ordering an investigation of western lands they held by government grant106 secretary of the interior lucius qc lamar charged that the rights of way for this land must be returned to the public because the railroads failed to extend their lines according to agreements106 the lands were forfeited resulting in the return of approximately 81000000 acres 330000 km2106 cleveland was the first democratic president subject to the tenure of office act which originated in 1867 the act purported to require the senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887107 vetoes cleveland faced a republican senate and often resorted to using his veto powers108 he vetoed hundreds of private pension bills for american civil war veterans believing that if their pensions requests had already been rejected by the pension bureau congress should not attempt to override that decision109 when congress pressured by the grand army of the republic passed a bill granting pensions for disabilities not caused by military service cleveland also vetoed that110 cleveland used the veto far more often than any president up to that time111 in 1887 cleveland issued his most wellknown veto that of the texas seed bill112 after a drought had ruined crops in several texas counties congress appropriated 10000 to purchase seed grain for farmers there112 cleveland vetoed the expenditure in his veto message he espoused a theory of limited government i can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the constitution and i do not believe that the power and duty of the general government ought to be extended to the relief of individual suffering which is in no manner properly related to the public service or benefit a prevalent tendency to disregard the limited mission of this power and duty should i think be steadfastly resisted to the end that the lesson should be constantly enforced that though the people support the government the government should not support the people the friendliness and charity of our countrymen can always be relied upon to relieve their fellowcitizens in misfortune this has been repeatedly and quite lately demonstrated federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character while it prevents the indulgence among our people of that kindly sentiment and conduct which strengthens the bonds of a common brotherhood113 silver one of the most volatile issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by gold and silver or by gold alone114 the issue cut across party lines with western republicans and southern democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver and both parties representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard115 because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold taxpayers paid their government bills in silver while international creditors demanded payment in gold resulting in a depletion of the nations gold supply115 cleveland and treasury secretary daniel manning stood firmly on the side of the gold standard and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the government was required to coin under the blandallison act of 1878116 cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated117 angered westerners and southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents118 in reply one of the foremost silverites richard p bland introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver inflating the thendeflating currency119 while blands bill was defeated so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement119 the result was a retention of the status quo and a postponement of the resolution of the free silver issue120 tariffs when we consider that the theory of our institutions guarantees to every citizen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry and enterprise with only such deduction as may be his share toward the careful and economical maintenance of the government which protects him it is plain that the exaction of more than this is indefensible extortion and a culpable betrayal of american fairness and justice  the public treasury which should only exist as a conduit conveying the peoples tribute to its legitimate objects of expenditure becomes a hoarding place for money needlessly withdrawn from trade and the peoples use thus crippling our national energies suspending our countrys development preventing investment in productive enterprise threatening financial disturbance and inviting schemes of public plunder clevelands third annual message to congress december 6 1887121 another contentious financial issue at the time was the protective tariff while it had not been a central point in his campaign clevelands opinion on the tariff was that of most democrats that the tariff ought to be reduced122 republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect american industries122 american tariffs had been high since the civil war and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus123 in 1886 a bill to reduce the tariff was narrowly defeated in the house124 the tariff issue was emphasized in the congressional elections that year and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the congress but cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform125 as the surplus grew cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only126 his message to congress in 1887 quoted at right highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay its operating expenses127 republicans as well as protectionist northern democrats like samuel j randall believed that american industries would fail without high tariffs and they continued to fight reform efforts128 roger q mills chairman of the house ways and means committee proposed a bill to reduce the tariff from about 47 to about 40129 after significant exertions by cleveland and his allies the bill passed the house129 the republican senate failed to come to agreement with the democratic house and the bill died in the conference committee dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election foreign policy 1885–1889 cleveland was a committed noninterventionist who had campaigned in opposition to expansion and imperialism he refused to promote the previous administrations nicaragua canal treaty and generally was less of an expansionist in foreign relations130 clevelands secretary of state thomas f bayard negotiated with joseph chamberlain of the united kingdom over fishing rights in the waters off canada and struck a conciliatory note despite the opposition of new englands republican senators131 cleveland also withdrew from senate consideration the berlin conference treaty which guaranteed an open door for us interests in the congo132 military policy 1885–1889 clevelands military policy emphasized selfdefense and modernization in 1885 cleveland appointed the board of fortifications under secretary of war william c endicott to recommend a new coastal fortification system for the united states133134 no improvements to us coastal defenses had been made since the late 1870s135136 the boards 1886 report recommended a massive 127 million construction program at 29 harbors and river estuaries to include new breechloading rifled guns mortars and naval minefields the board and the program are usually called the endicott board and the endicott program most of the boards recommendations were implemented and by 1910 27 locations were defended by over 70 forts137138 many of the weapons remained in place until scrapped in world war ii as they were replaced with new defenses endicott also proposed to congress a system of examinations for army officer promotions139 for the navy the cleveland administration spearheaded by secretary of the navy william collins whitney moved towards modernization although no ships were constructed that could match the best european warships although completion of the four steelhulled warships begun under the previous administration was delayed due to a corruption investigation and subsequent bankruptcy of their building yard these ships were completed in a timely manner in naval shipyards once the investigation was over140 sixteen additional steelhulled warships were ordered by the end of 1888 these ships later proved vital in the spanish–american war of 1898 and many served in world war i these ships included the secondclass battleships maine and texas designed to match modern armored ships recently acquired by south american countries from europe such as the brazilian battleship riachuelo141 eleven protected cruisers including the famous olympia one armored cruiser and one monitor were also ordered along with the experimental cruiser vesuvius142 civil rights and immigration cleveland like a growing number of northerners and nearly all white southerners saw reconstruction as a failed experiment and was reluctant to use federal power to enforce the 15th amendment of the us constitution which guaranteed voting rights to african americans143 though cleveland appointed no black americans to patronage jobs he allowed frederick douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in washington dc and appointed another black man james campbell matthews a former new york judge to replace douglass upon his resignation143 his decision to replace douglass with a black man was met with outrage but cleveland claimed to have known matthews personally144 henry l dawes wrote the dawes act which cleveland signed into law although cleveland had condemned the outrages against chinese immigrants he believed that chinese immigrants were unwilling to assimilate into white society145 secretary of state thomas f bayard negotiated an extension to the chinese exclusion act and cleveland lobbied the congress to pass the scott act written by congressman william lawrence scott which prevented the return of chinese immigrants who left the united states146 the scott act easily passed both houses of congress and cleveland signed it into law on october 1 1888146 indian policy cleveland viewed native americans as wards of the state saying in his first inaugural address that this guardianship involves on our part efforts for the improvement of their condition and enforcement of their rights147 he encouraged the idea of cultural assimilation pushing for the passage of the dawes act which provided for distribution of indian lands to individual members of tribes rather than having them continued to be held in trust for the tribes by the federal government147 while a conference of native leaders endorsed the act in practice the majority of native americans disapproved of it148 cleveland believed the dawes act would lift native americans out of poverty and encourage their assimilation into white society it ultimately weakened the tribal governments and allowed individual indians to sell land and keep the money147 in the month before clevelands 1885 inauguration president arthur opened four million acres of winnebago and crow creek indian lands in the dakota territory to white settlement by executive order149 tens of thousands of settlers gathered at the border of these lands and prepared to take possession of them149 cleveland believed arthurs order to be in violation of treaties with the tribes and rescinded it on april 17 of that year ordering the settlers out of the territory149 cleveland sent in eighteen companies of army troops to enforce the treaties and ordered general philip sheridan at the time commanding general of the u s army to investigate the matter149 marriage and children frances folsom cleveland cleveland entered the white house as a bachelor and his sister rose cleveland joined him to act as hostess for the first two years of his administration150 however unlike the previous bachelor president james buchanan cleveland did not remain a bachelor for very long in 1885 the daughter of clevelands friend oscar folsom visited him in washington151 frances folsom was a student at wells college when she returned to school president cleveland received her mothers permission to correspond with her and they were soon engaged to be married151 on june 2 1886 cleveland married frances folsom in the blue room at the white house152 he was the second president to wed while in office153 and has been the only president married in the white house this marriage was unusual since cleveland was the executor of oscar folsoms estate and had supervised francess upbringing after her fathers death nevertheless the public took no exception to the match154 at 21 years frances folsom cleveland was the youngest first lady in history and the public soon warmed to her beauty and warm personality155 the clevelands had five children ruth 1891–1904 esther 1893–1980 marion 1895–1977 richard 1897–1974 and francis grover 1903–1995 british philosopher philippa foot was their granddaughter156 administration and cabinet

vilas 1888–1889 secretary of agriculture norman jay coleman 1889 judicial appointments main article list of federal judges appointed by grover cleveland chief justice melville fuller during his first term cleveland successfully nominated two justices to the supreme court of the united states the first lucius qc lamar was a former mississippi senator who served in clevelands cabinet as interior secretary when william burnham woods died cleveland nominated lamar to his seat in late 1887 while lamar had been well liked as a senator his service under the confederacy two decades earlier caused many republicans to vote against him lamars nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28157 chief justice morrison waite died a few months later and cleveland nominated melville fuller to fill his seat on april 30 1888 fuller accepted he had previously declined clevelands nomination to the civil service commission preferring his chicago law practice the senate judiciary committee spent several months examining the littleknown nominee before the senate confirmed the nomination 41 to 20158159 cleveland nominated 41 lower federal court judges in addition to his four supreme court justices these included two judges to the united states circuit courts nine judges to the united states courts of appeals and 30 judges to the united states district courts because cleveland served terms both before and after congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the courts of appeals he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies the other benjamin harrison was in office at the time that the change was made thus all of clevelands appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term and all of his appointments to the courts of appeals were made in his second election of 1888 and return to private life defeated by harrison main articles united states presidential election 1888 and grover cleveland presidential campaign 1888 clevelandthurman campaign poster results of the 1888 election the republicans nominated benjamin harrison of indiana for president and levi p morton of new york for vice president cleveland was easily renominated at the democratic convention in st louis160 following vice president thomas a hendricks death in 1885 the democrats chose allen g thurman of ohio to be clevelands new running mate160 the republicans gained the upper hand in the campaign as clevelands campaign was poorly managed by calvin s brice and william h barnum whereas harrison had engaged more aggressive fundraisers and tacticians in matt quay and john wanamaker161 the republicans campaigned heavily on the tariff issue turning out protectionist voters in the important industrial states of the north162 further the democrats in new york were divided over the gubernatorial candidacy of david b hill weakening clevelands support in that swing state163 a letter from the british ambassador supporting cleveland caused a scandal which cost cleveland votes in new york as in 1884 the election focused on the swing states of new york new jersey connecticut and indiana but unlike that year when cleveland had triumphed in all four in 1888 he won only two losing his home state of new york by 14373 votes164 the republicans won indiana largely as the result of a fraudulent voting practice known as blocks of five165 cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to return to private life166 private citizen for four years as frances cleveland left the white house she told a staff member now jerry i want you to take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house for i want to find everything just as it is now when we come back again when asked when she would return she responded we are coming back four years from today167 in the meantime the clevelands moved to new york city where cleveland took a position with the law firm of bangs stetson tracy and macveigh this affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement though quite compatible clevelands law practice brought only a moderate income perhaps because cleveland spent considerable time at the couples vacation home gray gables at buzzard bay where fishing became his obsession168 while they lived in new york the clevelands first child ruth was born in 1891169 the harrison administration worked with congress to pass the mckinley tariff an aggressively protectionist measure and the sherman silver purchase act which increased money backed by silver170 these were among policies cleveland deplored as dangerous to the nations financial health171 at first he refrained from criticizing his successor but by 1891 cleveland felt compelled to speak out addressing his concerns in an open letter to a meeting of reformers in new york172 the silver letter thrust clevelands name back into the spotlight just as the 1892 election was approaching173 election of 1892 main articles united states presidential election 1892 and grover cleveland presidential campaign 1892 democratic nomination clevelands enduring reputation as chief executive and his recent pronouncements on the monetary issues made him a leading contender for the democratic nomination174 his leading opponent was david b hill a senator for new york175 hill united the anticleveland elements of the democratic party—silverites protectionists and tammany hall—but was unable to create a coalition large enough to deny cleveland the nomination175 despite some desperate maneuvering by hill cleveland was nominated on the first ballot at the convention in chicago176 for vice president the democrats chose to balance the ticket with adlai e stevenson of illinois a silverite177 although the cleveland forces preferred isaac p gray of indiana for vice president they accepted the convention favorite178 as a supporter of greenbacks and free silver to inflate the currency and alleviate economic distress in the rural districts stevenson balanced the otherwise hardmoney goldstandard ticket headed by cleveland179 campaign against harrison results of the 1892 election the republicans renominated president harrison making the 1892 election a rematch of the one four years earlier unlike the turbulent and controversial elections of 1876 1884 and 1888 the 1892 election was according to cleveland biographer allan nevins the cleanest quietest and most creditable in the memory of the postwar generation180 in part because harrisons wife caroline was dying of tuberculosis181 harrison did not personally campaign at all following caroline harrisons death on october 25 two weeks before the national election cleveland and all of the other candidates stopped campaigning thus making election day a somber and quiet event for the whole country as well as the candidates the issue of the tariff worked to the republicans advantage in 1888 the legislative revisions of the past four years also made imported goods so expensive that now many voters favored tariff reform and were skeptical of big business182 many westerners traditionally republican voters defected to james weaver the candidate of the new populist party weaver promised free silver generous veterans pensions and an eighthour work day183 the tammany hall democrats adhered to the national ticket allowing a united democratic party to carry new york184 at the campaigns end many populists and labor supporters endorsed cleveland after an attempt by the carnegie corporation to break the union during the homestead strike in pittsburgh and after a similar conflict between big business and labor at the tennessee coal and iron co185 the final result was a victory for cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes and it was clevelands third consecutive popular vote plurality186 second term as president 1893–1897 economic panic and the silver issue clevelands humiliation by gorman and the sugar trust shortly after clevelands second term began the panic of 1893 struck the stock market and he soon faced an acute economic depression187 the panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold that resulted from the increased coinage of silver and cleveland called congress into special session to deal with the problem188 the debate over the coinage was as heated as ever and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the sherman silver purchase act188 even so the silverites rallied their following at a convention in chicago and the house of representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin189 in the senate the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious cleveland forced against his better judgment to lobby the congress for repeal convinced enough democrats – and along with eastern republicans they formed a 48–37 majority for repeal190 depletion of the treasurys gold reserves continued at a lesser rate and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold191 at the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites but it marked the beginning of the end of silver as a basis for american currency192 tariff reform having succeeded in reversing the harrison administrations silver policy cleveland sought next to reverse the effects of the mckinley tariff the wilsongorman tariff act was introduced by west virginian representative william l wilson in december 1893193 after lengthy debate the bill passed the house by a considerable margin194 the bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff especially on raw materials195 the shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an income tax of two percent on income above 4000195 us107000 today40 the bill was next considered in the senate where it faced stronger opposition from key democrats led by arthur pue gorman of maryland who insisted on more protection for their states industries than the wilson bill allowed196 the bill passed the senate with more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms197 the sugar trust in particular lobbied for changes that favored it at the expense of the consumer198 cleveland was outraged with the final bill and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the senate by trusts and business interests199 even so he believed it was an improvement over the mckinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature200 voting rights in 1892 cleveland had campaigned against the lodge bill201 which would have strengthened voting rights protections through the appointing of federal supervisors of congressional elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district the enforcement act of 1871 had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of the electoral process from registration to the certification of returns cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law ch 25 28 stat 36202 the pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the repealing of voting rights protections this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in giles v harris 189 us 475 1903 and giles v teasley 193 us 146 1904 john t morgan senator from alabama opposed cleveland on free silver the tariff and the hawaii treaty saying of cleveland that i hate the ground that man walks on203 labor unrest the panic of 1893 had damaged labor conditions across the united states and the victory of antisilver legislation worsened the mood of western laborers204 a group of workingmen led by jacob s coxey began to march east toward washington dc to protest clevelands policies204 this group known as coxeys army agitated in favor of a national roads program to give jobs to workingmen and a weakened currency to help farmers pay their debts204 by the time they reached washington only a few hundred remained and when they were arrested the next day for walking on the lawn of the united states capitol the group scattered204 even though coxeys army may not have been a threat to the government it signaled a growing dissatisfaction in the west with eastern monetary policies205 pullman strike main article pullman strike the pullman strike had a significantly greater impact than coxeys army a strike began against the pullman company over low wages and twelvehour workdays and sympathy strikes led by american railway union leader eugene v debs soon followed206 by june 1894 125000 railroad workers were on strike paralyzing the nations commerce207 because the railroads carried the mail and because several of the affected lines were in federal receivership cleveland believed a federal solution was appropriate208 cleveland obtained an injunction in federal court and when the strikers refused to obey it he sent federal troops into chicago and 20 other rail centers209 if it takes the entire army and navy of the united states to deliver a postcard in chicago he proclaimed that card will be delivered210 most governors supported cleveland except democrat john p altgeld of illinois who became his bitter foe in 1896 leading newspapers of both parties applauded clevelands actions but the use of troops hardened the attitude of organized labor toward his administration211 just before the 1894 election cleveland was warned by francis lynde stetson an advisor we are on the eve of a very dark night unless a return of commercial prosperity relieves popular discontent with what they believe is democratic incompetence to make laws and consequently discontent with democratic administrations anywhere and everywhere212 the warning was appropriate for in the congressional elections republicans won their biggest landslide in decades taking full control of the house while the populists lost most of their support clevelands factional enemies gained control of the democratic party in state after state including full control in illinois and michigan and made major gains in ohio indiana iowa and other states wisconsin and massachusetts were two of the few states that remained under the control of clevelands allies the democratic opposition were close to controlling twothirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention which they needed to nominate their own candidate they failed for lack of unity and a national leader as illinois governor john peter altgeld had been born in germany and was ineligible to be nominated for president213 foreign policy 1893–1897 further information venezuela crisis of 1895 i suppose that right and justice should determine the path to be followed in treating this subject if national honesty is to be disregarded and a desire for territorial expansion or dissatisfaction with a form of government not our own ought to regulate our conduct i have entirely misapprehended the mission and character of our government and the behavior which the conscience of the people demands of their public servants clevelands message to congress on the hawaiian question december 18 1893214 when cleveland took office he faced the question of hawaiian annexation in his first term he had supported free trade with hawaii and accepted an amendment that gave the united states a coaling and naval station in pearl harbor132 in the intervening four years honolulu businessmen of european and american ancestry had denounced queen liliuokalani as a tyrant who rejected constitutional government in early 1893 they overthrew her set up a republican government under sanford b dole and sought to join the united states215 the harrison administration had quickly agreed with representatives of the new government on a treaty of annexation and submitted it to the senate for approval215 five days after taking office on march 9 1893 cleveland withdrew the treaty from the senate and sent former congressman james henderson blount to hawaii to investigate the conditions there216 cleveland agreed with blounts report which found the populace to be opposed to annexation216 liliuokalani initially refused to grant amnesty as a condition of her reinstatement saying that she would either execute or banish the current government in honolulu but doles government refused to yield their position217 by december 1893 the matter was still unresolved and cleveland referred the issue to congress217 in his message to congress cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the congress to continue the american tradition of nonintervention see excerpt at right214 the senate under democratic control but opposed to cleveland commissioned and produced the morgan report which contradicted blounts findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair218 cleveland dropped all talk of reinstating the queen and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the new republic of hawaii219 closer to home cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the monroe doctrine that not only prohibited new european colonies but also declared an american national interest in any matter of substance within the hemisphere220 when britain and venezuela disagreed over the boundary between venezuela and the colony of british guiana cleveland and secretary of state richard olney protested221 british prime minister lord salisbury and the british ambassador to washington julian pauncefote misjudged how important successful resolution of the dispute was to the american government having prolonged the crisis before ultimately accepting the american demand for arbitration222223 a tribunal convened in paris in 1898 to decide the matter and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to british guiana224 but by standing with a latin american nation against the encroachment of a colonial power cleveland improved relations with the united states southern neighbors and at the same time the cordial manner in which the negotiations were conducted also made for good relations with britain225 military policy 1893–1897 the second cleveland administration was as committed to military modernization as the first and ordered the first ships of a navy capable of offensive action construction continued on the endicott program of coastal fortifications begun under clevelands first administration133134 the adoption of the krag–jørgensen rifle the us armys first boltaction repeating rifle was finalized226227 in 1895–96 secretary of the navy hilary a herbert having recently adopted the aggressive naval strategy advocated by captain alfred thayer mahan successfully proposed ordering five battleships the kearsarge and illinois classes and sixteen torpedo boats228229 completion of these ships nearly doubled the navys battleships and created a new torpedo boat force which previously had only two boats however the battleships and seven of the torpedo boats were not completed until 1899–1901 after the spanish–american war230 cancer oil painting of grover cleveland painted in 1899 by anders zorn in the midst of the fight for repeal of free silver coinage in 1893 cleveland sought the advice of the white house doctor dr oreilly about soreness on the roof of his mouth and a craterlike edge ulcer with a granulated surface on the left side of clevelands hard palate samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the army medical museum the diagnosis was not a malignant cancer but instead an epithelioma231 cleveland decided to have surgery secretly to avoid further panic that might worsen the financial depression232 the surgery occurred on july 1 to give cleveland time to make a full recovery in time for the upcoming congressional session233 under the guise of a vacation cruise cleveland and his surgeon dr joseph bryant left for new york the surgeons operated aboard the oneida a yacht owned by clevelands friend e c benedict as it sailed off long island234 the surgery was conducted through the presidents mouth to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery235 the team sedating cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate235 the size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left clevelands mouth disfigured236 during another surgery cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance236 a cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated237 even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during clevelands vacation236 in 1917 one of the surgeons present on the oneida dr william w keen wrote an article detailing the operation238 cleveland enjoyed many years of life after the tumor was removed and there was some debate as to whether it was actually malignant several doctors including dr keen stated after clevelands death that the tumor was a carcinoma238 other suggestions included ameloblastoma239 or a benign salivary mixed tumor also known as a pleomorphic adenoma240 in the 1980s analysis of the specimen finally confirmed the tumor to be verrucous carcinoma241 a lowgrade epithelial cancer with a low potential for metastasis231 administration and cabinet clevelands last cabinet front row left

appointments main article list of federal judges appointed by grover cleveland clevelands trouble with the senate hindered the success of his nominations to the supreme court in his second term in 1893 after the death of samuel blatchford cleveland nominated william b hornblower to the court242 hornblower the head of a new york city law firm was thought to be a qualified appointee but his campaign against a new york machine politician had made senator david b hill his enemy242 further cleveland had not consulted the senators before naming his appointee leaving many who were already opposed to cleveland on other grounds even more aggrieved242 the senate rejected hornblowers nomination on january 15 1894 by a vote of 30 to 24242 cleveland continued to defy the senate by next appointing wheeler hazard peckham another new york attorney who had opposed hills machine in that state243 hill used all of his influence to block peckhams confirmation and on february 16 1894 the senate rejected the nomination by a vote of 32 to 41243 reformers urged cleveland to continue the fight against hill and to nominate frederic r coudert but cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice that of senator edward douglass white of louisiana whose nomination was accepted unanimously243 later in 1896 another vacancy on the court led cleveland to consider hornblower again but he declined to be nominated244 instead cleveland nominated rufus wheeler peckham the brother of wheeler hazard peckham and the senate confirmed the second peckham easily244 states admitted to the union no new states were admitted to the union during clevelands first term however on february 22 1889 10 days before leaving office the 50th congress passed the enabling act of 1889 authorizing north dakota south dakota montana and washington to form state governments and to gain admission to the union all four officially became states in november 1889 during the first year of benjamin harrisons administration245246 during his second term the 53rd united states congress passed an enabling act that permitted utah to apply for statehood cleveland signed it on july 16 1894247248 utah joined the union as the 45th state on january 4 1896 1896 election and retirement cleveland in 1903 at age 66 by frederick gutekunst clevelands agrarian and silverite enemies gained control of the democratic party in 1896 repudiated his administration and the gold standard and nominated william jennings bryan on a silver platform249250 cleveland silently supported the gold democrats thirdparty ticket that promised to defend the gold standard limit government and oppose high tariffs but he declined their nomination for a third term251 the party won only 100000 votes in the general election and william mckinley the republican nominee triumphed easily over bryan252 agrarians nominated bryan again in 1900 in 1904 the conservatives with clevelands support regained control of the democratic party and nominated alton b parker253 outgoing president grover cleveland at right stands nearby as william mckinley is sworn in as president by chief justice melville fuller after leaving the white house on march 4 1897 cleveland lived in retirement at his estate westland mansion in princeton new jersey254 for a time he was a trustee of princeton university and was one of the majority of trustees who preferred dean wests plans for the graduate school and undergraduate living over those of woodrow wilson then president of the university255 cleveland consulted occasionally with president theodore roosevelt 1901–1909 but was financially unable to accept the chairmanship of the commission handling the coal strike of 1902256 cleveland still made his views known in political matters in a 1905 article in the ladies home journal cleveland weighed in on the womens suffrage movement writing that sensible and responsible women do not want to vote the relative positions to be assumed by men and women in the working out of our civilization were assigned long ago by a higher intelligence257 in 1906 a group of new jersey democrats promoted cleveland as a possible candidate for the united states senate the incumbent john f dryden was not seeking reelection and some democrats felt that the former president could attract the votes of some disaffected republican legislators who might be drawn to clevelands statesmanship and conservatism258 clevelands health had been declining for several years and in the autumn of 1907 he fell seriously ill259 in 1908 he suffered a heart attack and died on june 24 at age 71259 his last words were i have tried so hard to do right260 he is buried in the princeton cemetery of the nassau presbyterian church261 honors and memorials 1000 gold certificate 1934
