fox news channel originally used the slogan fair and balanced which was coined by network cofounder roger ailes while the network was being established the new york times described the slogan as being both a blunt signal that fox news planned to counteract what mr ailes and many others viewed as a liberal bias ingrained in television coverage by establishment news networks5657 in august 2003 fox sued comedian al franken over his use of the slogan as a subtitle for his book lies and the lying liars who tell them a fair and balanced look at the right which is critical of fox news channel58 the lawsuit was dropped three days later after judge denny chin refused its request for an injunction in his decision chin ruled the case was wholly without merit both factually and legally he went on to suggest that fox news trademark on the phrase fair and balanced could be invalid59 in december 2003 fnc won a legal battle concerning the slogan when alternet filed a cancellation petition with the united states patent and trademark office uspto to have fncs trademark rescinded as inaccurate alternet included the documentary film outfoxed as supporting evidence in its case60 after losing early motions alternet withdrew its petition the uspto dismissed the case61 in 2008 fnc used the slogan we report you decide referring to you decide 2008 fncs original slogan for its coverage of election issues in august 2016 fox news channel began to quietly phase out the fair and balanced slogan in favor of most watched most trusted when these changes were reported in june 2017 by gabriel sherman a writer who had written a biography on ailes a network executive stated that the change has nothing to do with programming or editorial decisions it was speculated by media outlets that fox news channel was wishing to distance itself from ailes tenure at the network566257 controversiesedit main article fox news controversies sexual harassmentedit the network has been accused of permitting sexual harassment and racial discrimination by onair hosts executives and employees paying out millions of dollars in legal settlements63 prominent fox news figures such as roger ailes bill oreilly and eric bolling were eventually fired after a multitude of women accused them of sexually harassment at least four lawsuits alleged that fox news copresident bill shine ignored enabled or concealed roger ailes alleged sexual harassment646566 bill oreilly and fox news settled six agreements totaling 45 million with women who accused oreilly of sexual harassment6768 in january 2017 shortly after bill oreilly settled a sexual harassment lawsuit for 32 million an extraordinarily large amount for such cases fox news renewed bill oreillys contract67 fox newss parent company 21st century fox said that it was aware of the lawsuit67 fox newss extensive coverage of the harvey weinstein scandal in october 2017 was seen by some as hypocritical6970 fox news dedicated at least 12 hours of coverage to the weinstein scandal yet only dedicated 20 minutes to bill oreilly who just like weinstein had been accused of sexual harassment by a multitude of women7170 indira lakshmana an expert in journalism ethics at the poynter institute said that to devote hours of airtime to crowing about weinsteins welldeserved downfall because of his liberal politics while ignoring the massive decadeslong pattern of harassment by powerful men at fox is both hypocritical and sad70 a number of fox news hosts have welcomed bill oreilly to their shows and paid tributes to roger ailes after his death in may 2017 hannity called ailes a second father and said to ailess enemies that he was preparing to kick your a in the next life72 ailes had the year before been fired from fox news after a number of women alleged that he sexually harassed them72 in september 2017 several months after bill oreilly was fired from fox news in the wake of a number of women alleged that he sexual harassed them hannity hosted oreilly on his show737475 some fox news employees criticized the decision74 according to cnn during the interview hannity found kinship with oreilly as he appeared to feel that he and oreilly have both become victims of liberals looking to silence them76 earlier hannity had dedicated extensive coverage to the weinstein scandal77 biasedit see also racial bias in criminal news § fox news fox news channel has been widely criticized for biased reporting in favor of conservative political positions78796 and the republican party7 a 2008 study found that fox news gave disproportionate attention to polls that showed low approval for president bill clinton80 a 2009 study found that fox news was less likely to pick up stories that reflected well on democrats and more likely to pick up stories that reflected well on republicans81 a 2010 study comparing fox news channels special report with brit hume and nbcs nightly news coverage of the wars in iraq and afghanistan during 2005 concluded that fox news was much more sympathetic to the administration than nbc suggesting that if scholars continue to find evidence of a partisan or ideological bias at fnc they should consider fox as alternative rather than mainstream media82 research also shows that fox news increases republican vote shares and makes republican politicians more partisan9108384 a 2007 study using the introduction of fox news into local markets 19962000 as an instrumental variable found that in the 2000 presidential election republicans gained 04 to 07 percentage points in the towns that broadcast fox news suggesting that fox news convinced 3 to 28 percent of its viewers to vote republican depending on the audience measure10 these results were confirmed by a 2015 study84 a 2014 study using the same instrumental variable found that congressional representatives become less supportive of president clinton in districts where fox news begins broadcasting than similar representatives in similar districts where fox news was not broadcast83 a 2017 study using channel positions as an instrumental variable found that fox news increases republican vote shares by 03 points among viewers induced into watching 25 additional minutes per week by variation in position9 another 2014 paper found that fox news viewing increased republican vote shares among voters who identified as republican or independent85 fox news publicly denies that it is biased with murdoch and ailes saying have included murdochs statement that fox has given room to both sides whereas only one side had it before86 fox news host chris wallace has said i think we are the counterweight to nbc news they have a liberal agenda and we tell the other side of the story87 in 2004 robert greenwalds documentary film outfoxed rupert murdochs war on journalism argued that fox news had a conservative bias and featured clips from fox news and internal memos from editorial vice president john moody directing fox news staff on how to report certain subjects8889 a leaked memo from fox news vice president bill sammon to news staff at the height of the health care reform in the united states debate has been cited as an example of the prorepublican party bias of fox news his memo asked the staff to use the term governmentrun health insurance or when brevity is a concern government option whenever possible the memo was sent shortly after republican pollster frank luntz advised sean hannity on his fox show that if you call it a public option the american people are split if you call it the government option the public is overwhelmingly against it90 surveys show that fox news is widely perceived to be ideological a 2009 pew survey found that fox news is viewed as the most ideological channel in america with 47 percent of those surveyed said fox news is mostly conservative 14 percent said mostly liberal and 24 percent said neither in comparison msnbc had 36 percent identify it as mostly liberal 11 percent as mostly conservative and 27 percent as neither cnn had 37 percent describe it as mostly liberal 11 percent as mostly conservative and 33 percent as neither91 a 2004 pew research center survey showed that fnc was cited unprompted by 69 percent of national journalists as a conservative news organization92 a rasmussen poll found that 31 percent of americans felt that fox news had a conservative bias and 15 percent that it had a liberal bias the poll also reported that 36 percent believed fox news delivers news with neither a conservative or liberal bias compared with 37 percent who said npr delivers news with no conservative or liberal bias and 32 percent who said the same of cnn93 david carr media critic for the new york times praised the 2012 presidential election results coverage on fox news for the networks response to republican adviser and fox news contributor karl rove challenging its call that barack obama would win ohio and the election foxs prediction was correct carr wrote over many months fox lulled its conservative base with agitprop that president obama was a clear failure that a majority of americans saw mitt romney as a good alternative in hard times and that polls showing otherwise were politically motivated and not to be believed but on tuesday night the people in charge of fox news were confronted with a stark choice after it became clear that mr romney had fallen short was fox first and foremost a place for advocacy or a place for news in this moment at least fox chose news94 a may 2017 study conducted by harvard universitys shorenstein center on media politics and public policy examined coverage of us president donald trumps first 100 days in office by several major mainstream media outlets including fox95 it found that altogether trump received 80 negative coverage from the media and that he received the least negative coverage on fox – 52 negative and 48 positive96 coverage of russia investigationedit on 30 october 2017 when special counsel robert s mueller iii indicted paul manafort and rick gates and revealed that george papadopoulos had plead guilty all of whom were involved in the trump 2016 campaign this was the focus of most medias coverage except fox news97 hosts and guests on fox news called for mueller to be fired9798 sean hannity and tucker carlson focused their shows on unsubstantiated allegations that clinton sold uranium to russia in exchange for donations to the clinton foundation and on mostly discredited allegations that her campaign paid for opposition research on trump9799 hannity asserted the very thing they are accusing president trump of doing they did it themselves97 during the segment hannity mistakenly referred to clinton as president clinton97100 fox news dedicated extensive coverage to the uranium story which democrats said was an attempt to distract from muellers intensifying investigation101102 cnn described the coverage as a tour de force in deflection and dismissal99 on 31 october cnn reported that fox news employees were dissatisfied with their outlets coverage of the russia investigation with employees calling it an embarrassment laughable and saying it does the viewer a huge disservice and further divides the country and that it is another blow to journalists at fox who come in every day wanting to cover the news in a fair and objective way103104 when the investigation by special counsel robert mueller into russian interference in the 2016 presidential election intensified in october 2017 the focus of fox news coverage turned what they see as the scandal and wrongdoing of president trump’s political opponents in reports like these bill and hillary clinton are prominent and recurring characters because they are considered the real conspirators working with the russians to undermine american democracy105 paul waldman of the washington post described the coverage as no puppet you’re the puppet saying that it was a careful coordinated and comprehensive strategy to distract from muellers investigation106 german lopes of vox said that fox news coverage has reached levels of selfparody as it dedicated coverage to lowkey stories such as a controversial newsweek oped and hamburger emojis while other networks had walltowall coverage of muellers indictments107 on 1 november 2017 vox analyzed the transcripts of fox news cnn and msnbc and found that fox news was unable to talk about the mueller investigation without bringing up hillary clinton talked significantly less about george papadopoulos — the trump campaign adviser whose plea deal with mueller provides the most explicit evidence thus far that the campaign knew of the russian government’s efforts to help trump — than its competitors and repeatedly called mueller’s credibility into question108 false claims about other mediaedit cnns jake tapperedit in november 2017 fox news distorted a statement by jake tapper to make it appear as if he had said that allahu akbar can be used under the most beautiful circumstances in the immediate aftermath of the 2017 lower manhattan terrorist attack wherein a terrorist shouted allahu akbar109 fox news omitted that jake tapper had said that the use of allahu akbar in the terrorist attack was not one of these beautiful circumstances109 a headline on foxnewscom was preceded by a tag reading outrageous109 the fox news twitter account distorted the statement even more saying jake tapper says allahu akbar is beautiful right after nyc terror attack in a tweet that was later deleted109 tapper chastised fox news for choosing to deliberately lie and said there was a time when one could tell the difference between fox and the nutjobs at infowars it’s getting tougher and tougher lies are lies109 tapper had in 2009 while a white house correspondent for abc news famously come to the defense of fox news when obama criticized the network for not being a legitimate news organization110 fox news guest host jason chaffetz apologized to tapper for misrepresenting his statement111 even after fox news had deleted the tweet sean hannity repeated the misrepresentation and called tapper liberal fake news cnn’s fake jake tapper” and mocked his ratings111110 the new york timesedit in july 2017 a report by fox friends falsely said that the new york times had disclosed intelligence in one of its stories and that this intelligence disclosure helped abu bakr albaghdadi the leader of the islamic state to evade capture112 the report cited an inaccurate assertion by gen tony thomas the head of the united states special operations command that a major newspaper had disclosed the intelligence112113 fox news said that it was the new york times repeatedly running the chyron “nyt foils us attempt to take out albahgdadi113 pete hegseth one of the shows hosts criticized the “failing new york times”113 president donald trump tweeted about the fox friends report shortly after it first aired saying “the failing new york times foiled us attempt to kill the single most wanted terrorist albaghdadi their sick agenda over national security”112 fox news later updated the story but without apologizing to the new york times or responding directly to the inaccuracies113 in a washington post column erik wemple said that chris wallace had covered the new york times story himself on fox news sunday here’s another case of the differing standards between fox news’s opinion operation which has given a staterun vibe on all matters related to trump compared to fox news’s news operation which has provided mostly sane coverage114 climate changeedit a 2011 study found that fox news takes a more dismissive tone toward climate change than cnn and msnbc115 a 2008 study found that fox news emphasized the scientific uncertainty of climate change more than cnn less likely to state that climate change was real and more likely to interview climate change skeptics115 shepard smith has drawn attention for being one of few voices on fox news to forcefully state that climate change is real that human activities are a primary contributor to it and that there is a scientific consensus on the issue116117 his acceptance of the scientific consensus on climate change has drawn criticism from fox news viewers and conservatives118119 in 2001 sean hannity described the scientific consensus on climate change as phony science from the left120 in 2004 he falsely alleged scientists still can’t agree on whether the global warming is scientific fact or fiction120 in 2010 hannity said that socalled climategate the leaking of emails by climate scientist that climate change skeptics claimed demonstrated scientific misconduct but which all subsequent enquiries have found no evidence of misconduct or wrongdoing a scandal that exposed global warming as a myth cooked up by alarmists121 hannity frequently invites contrarian fringe scientists and critics of climate change to his shows122 donald trump wiretapping claimedit on march 14 2017 andrew napolitano a fox news commentator claimed on fox friends that british intelligence agency gchq had wiretapped donald trump on behalf of barack obama during the 2016 united states presidential election123124 on march 16 2017 white house spokesman sean spicer repeated the claim123 when trump was questioned about the claim at a news conference he said all we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television i didnt make an opinion on it125 on march 17 2017 shepard smith a fox news anchor acknowledged that the network had no evidence that trump was under surveillance british officials said the white house was backing off the claim but the white house did not release a public statement expressing regret125 napolitano was later suspended by fox news for making the claim126 encouragement of violence against protestersedit in january 2017 the daily caller published a video which encouraged violence against protesters127128129 the video was subsequently reposted by fox nation an offshoot of fox news website127 the video in question showed a car plowing through protesters with the headline heres a reel of cars plowing through protesters trying to block the road and set to a cover of ludacris move bitch127 the video drew attention in august 2017 when a white supremacist plowed his car through a group of counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally in charlottesville127 after the video attracted attention fox news deleted it from its website127129 murder of seth rich conspiracyedit see also murder of seth rich on 16 may 2017 the same day that other news organizations were extensively covering donald trump revelation of classified information to russia130 fox news ran a lead story about a private investigators uncorroborated claims about the murder of seth rich a dnc staffer131132133 the private investigator asserted that he had uncovered evidence that rich was in contact with wikileaks and that law enforcement were covering it up131 the killing of rich has given rise to conspiracy theories in rightwing circles that hillary clinton and the democratic party had seth rich killed allegedly because he was the source of the dnc leaks131 us intelligence agencies had determined that russia was the source of the leaks134 in reporting the investigators claims the fox news report reignited rightwing conspiracy theories about the killing131133 other news organizations revealed that the investigator was a donald trump supporter and had according to nbc news developed a reputation for making outlandish claims such as one appearance on fox news in 2007 in which he warned that underground networks of pink pistoltoting lesbian gangs were raping young women131135 the family of seth rich the washington dc police department the washington dc mayors office the fbi and law enforcement sources familiar with the case rebuked the investigators claims131132 the family said we are a family who is committed to facts not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding seth’s murderers131 the spokesperson for the family criticized fox news for its reporting alleging that the outlet was motivated by a desire to deflect attention from the trumprussia story i think there’s a very special place in hell for people that would use the memory of a murder victim in order to pursue a political agenda130 the family has called for retractions and apologies from fox news for the inaccurate reporting136137over the course of the day fox news altered the contents of the story and the headline but did not issue corrections138139 when cnn contacted the private investigator later that day the investigator said that he had no evidence that rich had contacted wikileaks133 the investigator claimed that he only learned about the possible existence of the evidence from a fox news reporter133 fox news did not respond to inquiries by cnn and the washington post133132 fox news later on 23 may retracted its original report stating that the original report did not meet its standards140 nicole hemmer assistant professor at the miller center of public affairs wrote that the promotion of the conspiracy theory demonstrated how fox news was remaking itself in the image of fringe media in the age of trump blurring the lines between real and fake news141 max boot of the council on foreign relations said that while intent behind fox news as a counterweight to the liberal media was laudable the culmination of those efforts have been to create an alternative news source that promotes hoaxes and myths of which the promotion of the seth rich conspiracy is an example142 fox news was also criticized by conservative outlets such as the weekly standard143 national review144145 and conservative columnists such as jennifer rubin146 michael gerson147 and john podhoretz148 obama administration conflict with fox newsedit in september 2009 the obama administration engaged in a verbal conflict with fox news channel on september 20 president obama appeared on all major news programs except fox news a snub partially in response to remarks about the president by commentators glenn beck and sean hannity and fox coverage of obamas healthcare proposal149150 in late september 2009 obama senior advisor david axelrod and roger ailes met in secret to attempt to smooth out tensions between the two camps two weeks later white house officials referred to fnc as not a news network communications director anita dunn stating that fox news often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the republican party151152 president obama observed if media is operating basically as a talk radio format then thats one thing and if its operating as a news outlet then thats another153 white house chief of staff rahm emanuel stated that it was important to not have the cnns and the others in the world basically be led in following fox154 within days it was reported that fox had been excluded from an interview with administration official ken feinberg with bureau chiefs from the white house press pool abc cbs nbc and cnn coming to foxs defense155 a bureau chief stated if any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing it has nothing to do with fox or the white house or the substance of the issues156 shortly after the story broke the white house admitted to a lowlevel mistake saying that fox had not made a specific request to interview feinberg fox white house correspondent major garrett responded by stating that he had not made a specific request but that he had a standing request from me as senior white house correspondent on fox to interview any newsmaker at the treasury at any given time news is being made157 on november 8 2009 the los angeles times reported that an unnamed democratic consultant was warned by the white house not to appear on fox news again according to the article anita dunn claimed in an email to have checked with colleagues who deal with tv issues and had been told that nobody had been instructed to avoid fox patrick caddell a fox news contributor and former pollster for president jimmy carter said he had spoken with other democratic consultants who had received similar warnings from the white house158 on october 2 2013 fox news host anna kooiman cited on the air a fake story from the national report parody site which claimed that president obama had offered to keep the international museum of muslim cultures open with cash from his own pocket159160161 white supremacist rally in charlottesvilleedit various fox news hosts and contributors defended president trumps remarks that many sides were to blame for violence at a gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in charlottesville virginia162163 some fox news hosts and contributors criticized trump164163 in a press conference on 15 august trump used the term altleft to describe counterprotesters at the white supremacist rally a term which had been used in fox news coverage of the white supremacist rally162 several of trumps comments at the press conference mirrored those appearing earlier on fox news165 fox news contributor laura ingraham offered a partial defense of trump saying that trump was right to point out the evil of a far left that is trying to tear down both history and intimidate free speech in the country162 on the day of trumps press conference fox news hosts tucker carlson and sean hannity focused their shows on criticizing liberals and the media164 the next day hannity focused his show on the racist past of the democratic party as well as leftwing acceptance of black radicalism163 fox news host tucker carlson also covered historical figures such as thomas jefferson mohammed simon bolivar and plato who owned slaves on his show and said that individuals who wanted to remove confederate monuments would want to remove statues of abraham lincoln next162164166 carlson also questioned whether it was a violation of the first amendment for businesses to deny services to white supremacists163 a guest on tucker carlsons show equated individuals who want to remove confederate monuments to weimar thugs and the taliban164 a guest on fox friends equated the confederate flag with the rainbow flag saying they represent the exact same thing and the hosts of fox friends did not provide a response to the guests remarks167168 the fox friends host pete hegseth blamed the media for the violence at the white supremacist gathering169 according to dylan byers of cnn fox news coverage on the day of the press conference was heavy with whataboutism the average fox viewer was likely left with the impression that the medias criticism of trump and leftist protestors toppling of some confederate statues were far greater threats to america than white supremacism or the presidents apparent defense of bigotry164 byers wrote it showed that if fox news has a line when it comes to trumps presidency it was not crossed on tuesday164 international transmissionedit this
