you are my life2 streetwalker had previously appeared as a track on the 2001 special edition of jacksons seventh studio album bad compositionedit the themes of cry are world issues such as isolation war and brotherhood it also suggests if everyone pulls together as one then they make a change to the world with jackson singing you can change the worldi cant do it by myself3 music critic mark brown of rocky mountain news felt that jackson cries the lyrics i cant do it by myself4 the songs lyrics and themes are similar to the ones in jacksons 1988 single man in the mirror5 and his 1991 single heal the world6 cry is composed in the key of a major and the songs time signature is common time cry has a moderate metronome of eighty four beats per minute7 the single is built in the chord progression of a–ga–a–ag in the verses and a–ag–d–a in the chorus7 the sheet music indicates the vocal range spans a3 to g57 critical receptionedit jason elias of allmusic describes cry as a moody and reflective piece of material reminiscent of jacksons quincy jonesproduced ballads for bad and indicates the songs themes are those of alienation and sorrow rather than love he believes the strength of the strings the competent backing vocals and the keyboard figures prevent the listener from convulsing with laughter at jacksons ohsopained delivery and interjections of hold on or oh my8 jon pareles of the new york times called the track the changetheworldsong and wrote that the single applies its grand buildup to one of pops strangest utopian schemes which was asking everyone to cry at the same time at which point jackson may answer their prayers9 catherine halaby of yale daily news felt that the song is a less triumphant use of a contemporarys input on the album10 nme music critic mark beaumont believed that jackson starts banging creepily on about the lyrics which pertain to saving the children11 frank kogan of the village voice noted that while cry and another song from invincible speechless are very pretty they give the impression that jacksons standing sideways so as to let the beauty slide off him12 los angeles times staff writer robert hilburn wrote that the track fills the social commentary role of jacksons man in the mirror 19885 while hartford courant rock music critic roger catlin believed that the single is a redux to jacksons heal the world 199113 newsday staff writer glenn gamboa said that the song was equally average to other tracks on invincible14 james hunter of rolling stone magazine wrote that r kelly more or less succeeds with the kind of life affirming number on the single15 jim farber of new yorks daily news wrote that in cry jackson goes into his healingtheworld shtick though rarely has he been this condescending about his role as universal savior16 chicago tribune rock music critics greg kot believed that r kelly reprises the formula of his big gospelstoked anthem i believe i can fly on the track17 a journalist for the wichita eagle wrote that jackson shines on the sincere ballads such as cry heartbreaker and speechless6 pop music critic thor christensen of the dallas morning news described the single as being the musicians latest batch of inspirational cotton candy18 francisco cangiano of university wire noted that the overall good songs from invincible are heartbreaker cry and speechless19 pamela davis and gina
