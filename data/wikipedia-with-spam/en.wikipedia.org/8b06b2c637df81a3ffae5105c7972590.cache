grubman and record executives seymour stein bob krasnow and noreen woods the foundation began inducting artists in 1986 but the hall of fame still had no home the search committee considered several cities including philadelphia home of bill haley and american bandstand memphis home of sun studios and stax records detroit home of motown records cincinnati home of king records new york city and clevelandcitation needed cleveland lobbied for the museum citing that wjw disc jockey alan freed both coined the term rock and roll and heavily promoted the new genre—and that cleveland was the location of freeds moondog coronation ball the first major rock and roll concert in addition cleveland cited radio station wmms which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the us during the 1970s and 80s including artist david bowie who began his first us tour in the city bruce springsteen roxy music and rush among many others4 cleveland was also one of the premier tour stops for most rock bands civic leaders in cleveland pledged 65 million in public money to fund the construction a petition drive was signed by 600000 fans favoring cleveland over memphis and cleveland ranked first in a 1986 usa today poll asking where the hall of fame should be located on may 5 1986 the hall of fame foundation chose cleveland as the permanent home of the rock and roll hall of fame and museum sam phillips of sun studios fame and many others were stunned and disappointed that it ended up in cleveland the hall of fame shouldve been in memphis certainly wrote peter guralnick author of an acclaimed twovolume elvis presley biography5 cleveland may also have been chosen as the organizations site because the city offered the best financial package as the plain dealer music critic michael norman noted it was 65 million cleveland wanted it here and put up the money cofounder jann wenner later said one of the small sad things is we didnt do it in new york in the first place but then added i am absolutely delighted that the rock and roll hall of fame and museum is in cleveland during early discussions on where to build the hall of fame and museum the foundations board considered the cuyahoga river ultimately the chosen location was along east ninth street in downtown cleveland by lake erie east of cleveland stadium at one point in the planning phase when a financing gap existed planners proposed locating the rock hall in the thenvacant may company building but finally decided to commission architect i m pei to design a new building initial ceo dr larry r thompson facilitated i m pei in designs for the site pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it the museum tower was initially planned to stand 200 ft 61 m high but had to be cut down to 162 ft 49 m due to its proximity to burke lakefront airport the buildings base is approximately 150000 square feet 14000 m2 the groundbreaking ceremony took place on june 7 1993

years after the release of their first record criteria include the influence and significance of the artists contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll to be selected for induction performers must receive the highest number of votes and also greater than 50 of the votes around five to seven performers are inducted each year33 in 2012 six additional groups the miracles the famous flames the comets the blue caps the midnighters and the crickets were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted there was a lot of discussion about this said terry stewart a member of the nominating committee there had always been conversations about why the groups werent included when the lead singers were inducted very honestly nobody could really answer that question – it was so long ago we decided wed sit down as an organization and look at that this is the result34 early influencesedit early influences includes artists from earlier eras primarily country folk and blues whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists other notable artists that have been inducted as early influences include bill kenny the ink spots country musicians jimmie rodgers and hank williams blues musicians howlin wolf and muddy waters and jazz musicians jelly roll morton and louis armstrong after nat king cole and billie holiday in 2000 no one was inducted in this category until 2009 when rockabilly singer wanda jackson was selected unlike earlier inductees in this category jacksons

primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry including record label executives songwriters record producers disc jockeys concert promoters and music journalists this category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009 following the death of the hall of fames cofounder ahmet ertegun this award was renamed in his honor in 200835 award for musical excellenceedit formerly the sidemen award this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran session and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers the category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and reactivated in 2008 this honor was renamed the award for musical excellence in 2010 according to joel peresman the president of the rock and roll hall of fame foundation this award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized36 library and archivesedit the rock and roll hall of fame in cleveland ohio november 2015 the rock and roll hall of fame and museums library and archives is the worlds most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll the library and archives is located in a new building on the metro campus of cuyahoga community college in clevelands campus district the library and archives mission is to collect preserve and provide access to these

sue cassidy clark and rare concert recordings from cbgb in the 1970s373839 criticismedit the most frequent criticism of the hall of fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians such as founder jann wenner cofounder and editorinchief of rolling stone magazine former foundation director suzan evans and writer dave marsh reflecting their personal tastes rather than the views of the rock world as a whole a former member of the nominations board once commented that at one point suzan evans lamented the choices being made because there werent enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner that was quickly remedied by dropping one of the doowop groups being considered in favor of a name artist i saw how certain pioneering artists of the 50s and early 60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list resulting in 70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them some of those pioneers still arent in today40 sister rosetta tharpe is often considered the godmothergrandmother of rock roll4142 but has yet to be inducted also the influential soulfunk group tower of power has not yet been honored velvet underground drummer maureen tucker has dismissed the hall of fame as the hall of lame43 there is also controversy in the lack of transparency in the selection process janet morrissey of the new york times wrote with fame and money at stake its no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders – and committee members say they want to keep it that way44 jon landau the chairman of the nominating committee says they prefer it that way weve done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent it all dies in the room44 according to fox news petitions with tens of thousands of signatures were also being ignored and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all40 the committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres45 according to author brett milano entire genres get passed over particularly progressive rock 60s top 40 new orleans funk and a whole lot of black music46 in contrast since the mid2000s decade numerous hip hop artists have been inducted including tupac shakur class of 2017 nwa class of 2016 and grandmaster flash and the furious five class of 200747 another criticism is that too many artists are inducted in fifteen years 97 different artists were inducted48 a minimum of 50 of the vote is needed to be inducted although the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees five in 2011 is set before the ballots are shipped48 the committee usually nominates a small number of artists 12 in 2010 from an increasing number of different genres several voters including joel selvin himself a former member of the nominating committee did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy49 members of the british punk rock band the sex pistols inducted in 2006 refused to attend the ceremony calling the museum a piss stain and urine in wine50 in bbc radio 6 musics annual john peel lecture in 2013 the singer charlotte church accused the museum of gender bias stating out of 295 acts and artists in the rock n roll hall of fame 259 are entirely male meaning that tina weymouths part in talking heads makes them one of the 36 female acts5152 in fact the actual percentage of woman inductees is 8553 combining all the categories there have been 719 inductees out of which only 61 have been women none of which has been inducted more than once or awarded the lifetime achievement54 2007 vote controversyedit on march 14 2007 two days after that years induction ceremony roger friedman of fox news published an article claiming that the dave clark five should have been the fifth inductee as they had more votes than inductee grandmaster flash and the furious five the article went on to say jann wenner used a technicality about the day votes were due in in reality the dave clark five got six more votes than grandmaster flash but he felt we couldnt go another year without a rap act47 the rock and roll hall of fame foundation would later deny fixing the vote although they did not deny that late votes were received saying no there is a format and rules and procedure there is a specific time when the votes have to be in and then they are counted the bands with the top five votes got in55 the dave clark five was subsequently nominated again and then inducted the following year56 the monkees controversyedit in june 2007 monkee peter tork complained to the new york post that wenner had blackballed the monkees commenting wenner doesnt care what the rules are and just operates how he sees fit it is an abuse of power i dont know whether the monkees belong in the hall of fame but its pretty clear that were not in there because of a personal whim jann seems to have taken it harder than everyone else and now 40 years later everybody says whats the big deal everybody else does it uses studio artists or backing bands nobody cares now except him he feels his moral judgment in 1967 and 1968 is supposed to serve in 2007 in a facebook post fellow monkee michael nesmith stated that he does not know if the monkees belong in the hall of fame because he can only see the impact of the monkees from the inside and further stated i can see the hof hall of fame is a private enterprise it seems to operate as a business and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the enterprise the inductees appear to be chosen at the owners pleasure this seems proper to me it is their business in any case it does not seem to me that the hof carries a public mandate nor should it be compelled to conform to one57 various magazines and news outlets such as time58 npr radio59 the christian science monitor60 goldmine magazine6162 yahoo music63 and msnbc 64 have argued that the monkees belong in the rock and roll hall of fame see alsoedit rock and roll portal cleveland portal list of rock and roll hall of fame inductees referencesedit 2013–14 annual report to
