americans with total or partial ancestry from any of the black racial groups of africa45 this term may also be used to include only those individuals who are descended from enslaved africans67 as a compound adjective the term is usually hyphenated as africanamerican89 black and african americans constitute the third largest racial and ethnic group in the united states after white americans and hispanic and latino americans10 most african americans are descendants of enslaved peoples within the boundaries of the present united states1112 on average african americans are of westcentral african and european descent and some also have native american ancestry13 according to us census bureau data african immigrants generally do not selfidentify as african american the overwhelming majority of african immigrants identify instead with their own respective ethnicities 9514 immigrants from some caribbean central american and south american nations and their descendants may or may not also selfidentify with the term9 africanamerican history starts in the 16th century with peoples from west africa forcibly taken as slaves to spanish america and in the 17th century with west african slaves taken to english colonies in north america after the founding of the united states black people continued to be enslaved and the last four million black slaves were only liberated after the civil war in 186515 due to notions of white supremacy they were treated as secondclass citizens the naturalization act of 1790 limited us citizenship to whites only and only white men of property could vote1617 these circumstances were changed by reconstruction development of the black community participation in the great military conflicts of the united states the elimination of racial segregation and the civil rights movement which sought political and social freedom in 2008 barack obama became the first african american to be elected president of the united states18 contents 1

colonial era main articles slavery in the colonial united states and atlantic slave trade the first african slaves arrived via santo domingo to the san miguel de gualdape colony most likely located in the winyah bay area of presentday south carolina founded by spanish explorer lucas vázquez de ayllón in 152619 the illfated colony was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership during which the slaves revolted and fled the colony to seek refuge among local native americans de ayllón and many of the colonists died shortly afterwards of an epidemic and the colony was abandoned the settlers and the slaves who had not escaped returned to haiti whence they had come19 the first recorded africans in british north america including most of the future united states were 20 and odd negroes who came to jamestown virginia via cape comfort in august 1619 as indentured servants20 as english settlers died from harsh conditions more and more africans were brought to work as laborers21 slaves processing tobacco in 17thcentury virginia typically young men or women would sign a contract of indenture in exchange for transportation to the new world the landowner received 50 acres of land from the state headrights for each servant purchased around £6 per person equivalent to 9 months income in the 17th century from a ships captaincitation needed an indentured servant who could be white or black would work for several years usually four to seven without wages the status of indentured servants in early virginia and maryland was similar to slavery servants could be bought sold or leased and they could be physically beaten for disobedience or running away unlike slaves they were freed after their term of service expired or was bought out their children did not inherit their status and on their release from contract they received a years provision of corn double apparel tools necessary and a small cash payment called freedom dues22 africans could legally raise crops and cattle to purchase their freedom23 they raised families married other africans and sometimes intermarried with native americans or english settlers24 the first slave auction at new amsterdam in 1655 by howard pyle by the 1640s and 1650s several african families owned farms around jamestown and some became wealthy by colonial standards and purchased indentured servants of their own in 1640 the virginia general court recorded the earliest documentation of lifetime slavery when they sentenced john punch a negro to lifetime servitude under his master hugh gwyn for running away2526 one of dutch african arrivals anthony johnson would later own one of the first black slaves john casor resulting from the court ruling of a civil case2728 the popular conception of a racebased slave system did not fully develop until the 18th century the dutch west india company introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves into new amsterdam presentday new york city all the colonys slaves however were freed upon its surrender to the british29 reproduction of a handbill advertising a slave auction in charleston south carolina in 1769 massachusetts was the first british colony to legally recognize slavery in 1641 in 1662 virginia passed a law that children of enslaved women who were of african descent and thus foreigners took the status of the mother rather than that of the father as under english common law this principle was called partus sequitur ventrum3031 by an act of 1699 the colony ordered all free blacks deported virtually defining as slaves all people of african descent who remained in the colony32 in 1670 the colonial assembly passed a law prohibiting free and baptized negroes and indians from purchasing christians in this act meaning english or european whites but allowing them to buy people of their owne nation33 the earliest africanamerican congregations and churches were organized before 1800 in both northern and southern cities following the great awakening by 1775 africans made up 20 of the population in the american colonies which made them the second largest ethnic group after the english34 from the american revolution to the civil war main article slavery in the united states crispus attucks the first martyr of the american revolution he was of native american and africanamerican descent during the 1770s africans both enslaved and free helped rebellious english colonists secure american independence by defeating the british in the american revolution35 africans and englishmen fought side by side and were fully integrated36 blacks played a role in both sides in the american revolution activists in the patriot cause included james armistead prince whipple and oliver cromwell37 slavery had been tacitly enshrined in the us constitution through provisions such as article i section 2 clause 3 commonly known as the 35 compromise slavery which by then meant almost exclusively african americans was the most important political issue in the antebellum united states leading to one crisis after another among these were the missouri compromise the compromise of 1850 the fugitive slave act and the dred scott decision frederick douglass prior to the civil war eight serving presidents owned slaves a practice protected by the us constitution38 by 1860 there were 35 to 44 million enslaved blacks in the us due to the atlantic slave trade and another 488000–500000 african americans lived free with legislated limits39 across the country4041 with legislated limits imposed upon them in addition to unconquerable prejudice from whites according to henry clay42 some blacks who werent enslaved left the us for liberia in africa39 liberia began as a settlement of the american colonization society acs in 1821 with the abolitionist members of the acs believing blacks would face better chances for freedom and equality in africa39 the slaves not only constituted a large investment they produced americas most valuable product and export cotton they not only helped build the us capitol they built the white house and other district of columbia buildings washington was a slave trading center43 similar building projects existed in slaveholding states in 1863 during the american civil war president abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation the proclamation declared that all slaves in confederateheld territory were free44 advancing union troops enforced the proclamation with texas being the last state to be emancipated in 186545 harriet tubman slavery in unionheld confederate territory continued at least on paper until the passage of the thirteenth amendment in 186546 prior to the civil war only white men of property could vote and the naturalization act of 1790 limited us citizenship to whites only1617 the 14th amendment 1868 gave africanamericans citizenship and the 15th amendment 1870 gave africanamerican males the right to vote only males could vote in the us at the time reconstruction era and jim crow main articles reconstruction era and jim crow laws african americans quickly set up congregations for themselves as well as schools and communitycivic associations to have space away from white control or oversight while the postwar reconstruction era was initially a time of progress for african americans that period ended in 1876 by the late 1890s southern states enacted jim crow laws to enforce racial segregation and disenfranchisement47 segregation which began with slavery continued with jim crow laws with signs used to show blacks where they could legally walk talk drink rest or eat48 for those places that were racially mixed non whites had to wait until all white customers were dealt with48 most african americans obeyed the jim crow laws in order to avoid racially motivated violence to maintain selfesteem and dignity african americans such as anthony overton and mary mcleod bethune continued to build their own schools churches banks social clubs and other businesses49 in the last decade of the 19th century racially discriminatory laws and racial violence aimed at african americans began to mushroom in the united states a period often referred to as the nadir of american race relations these discriminatory acts included racial segregation—upheld by the united states supreme court decision in plessy v ferguson in 1896—which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the local level of government voter suppression or disenfranchisement in the southern states denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide and private acts of violence and mass racial violence aimed at african americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities50 great migration and civil rights movement main articles

during the omaha race riot of 1919 in omaha nebraska postcards and photographs of lynchings were popular souvenirs in the us51 the desperate conditions of african americans in the south sparked the great migration of the early 20th century which led to a growing africanamerican community in the northern united states52 the rapid influx of blacks disturbed the racial balance within northern cities exacerbating hostility between both black and white northerners urban riots—whites attacking blacks—became a northern problem53 the red summer of 1919 was marked by hundreds of deaths and higher casualties across the us as a result of race riots that occurred in more than three dozen cities such as the chicago race riot of 1919 and the omaha race riot of 1919 overall blacks in northern cities experienced systemic discrimination in a plethora of aspects of life within employment economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the loweststatus and restrictive in potential mobility within the housing market stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx resulting in a mix of targeted violence restrictive covenants redlining and racial steering54 while many whites defended their space with violence intimidation or legal tactics toward african americans many other whites migrated to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions a process known as white flight55 emmett till was a fourteenyearold boy whose lynching mobilized the black community throughout the us56 by the 1950s the civil rights movement was gaining momentum a 1955 lynching that sparked public outrage about injustice was that of emmett till a 14yearold boy from chicago spending the summer with relatives in money mississippi till was killed for allegedly having wolfwhistled at a white woman till had been badly beaten one of his eyes was gouged out and he was shot in the head the visceral response to his mothers decision to have an opencasket funeral

defendants but they were speedily acquitted by an allwhite jury57 one hundred days after emmett tills murder rosa parks refused to give up her seat on the bus in alabama—indeed parks told emmetts mother mamie till that the photograph of emmett’s disfigured face in the casket was set in her mind when she refused to give up her seat on the montgomery bus58 march on washington for jobs and freedom august 28 1963 shows civil rights leaders and union leaders the march on washington for jobs and freedom and the conditions which brought it into being are credited with putting pressure on presidents john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson johnson put his support behind passage of the civil rights act of 1964 that banned discrimination in public accommodations employment and labor unions and the voting rights act of 1965 which expanded federal authority over states to ensure black political participation through protection of voter registration and elections59 by 1966 the emergence of the black power movement which lasted from 1966 to 1975 expanded upon the aims of the civil rights movement to include economic and political selfsufficiency and freedom from white authority60 during the postwar period many african americans continued to be economically disadvantaged relative to other americans average black income stood at 54 percent of that of white workers in 1947 and 55 percent in 1962 in 1959 median family income for whites was 5600 compared with 2900 for nonwhite families in 1965 43 percent of all black families fell into the poverty bracket earning under 3000 a

percent of black families earned under 3000 a year compared with 41 percent in 1960 in 1965 19 percent of black americans had incomes equal to the national median a proportion that rose to 27 percent by 1967 in 1960 the median level of education for blacks had been 108 years and by the late sixties the figure rose to 122 years half a year behind the median for whites61 postcivil rights era main

the 1890s to the 1970s from 1916 through the 1960s more than 6 million black people moved north but in the 1970s and 1980s that trend reversed with more african americans moving south to the sun belt

does have a sizable black population in certain areas however california the nations most populous state has the fifth largest africanamerican population only behind new york texas georgia and florida according to the 2000 census approximately 205 of african americans identified as hispanic or latino in origin10 many of whom may be of brazilian puerto rican dominican cuban haitian or other latin american descent the only selfreported ancestral groups larger than african americans are the irish and germans73 because many african americans trace their ancestry to colonial american origins some simply selfidentify as americancitation needed according to the 2010 us census nearly 3 of people who selfidentified as black had recent ancestors who immigrated from another country selfreported nonhispanic black immigrants from the caribbean mostly from jamaica and haiti represented 09 of the us population at 26 million74 selfreported black immigrants from subsaharan africa also represented

black american or ethnic african americans who are direct descendants of westcentral africans brought to the us as slaves these individuals make up well over 80 of all blacks in the country when including people of mixedrace origin about 135 of the us population selfidentified as black or mixed with black76 however according to the us census bureau evidence from the 2000 census indicates that many african and caribbean immigrant ethnic groups do not identify as black african am or negro instead they wrote in their own respective ethnic groups in the some other race writein entry as a result the census bureau devised a new separate african american ethnic group category in 2010 for ethnic african americans77 following lobbying led by the arab american institute a national organization representing arab americans the census bureau also announced in 2014 that it may establish an additional new ethnic category for populations from the middle east north africa and the arab world78 us cities further information list of us cities with large africanamerican populations and list of us metropolitan areas with large africanamerican populations almost 58 of african americans

chicago has the second largest black population with almost 16 million african americans in its metropolitan area representing about 18 percent of the total metropolitan populationcitation needed after 100 years of africanamericans leaving the south in large numbers seeking better opportunities in the west and north a movement known as the great migration there is now a reverse trend called

increased by 73 percent and only 15 percent for whites85 black women are enrolled in college more than any other race and gender group leading all with 97 enrolled according to the 2011 us census bureau8687 predominantly black schools for kindergarten through twelfth grade students were common throughout the us before the 1970s by 1972 however desegregation efforts meant that only 25 of black students were in schools with more than 90 nonwhite students however since then a trend towards resegregation affected communities across the country by 2011 29 million africanamerican students were in such overwhelmingly minority schools including 53 of black students in school districts that were formerly under desegregation orders8889 historically black colleges and universities hbcus which were originally set up when segregated colleges did not admit african americans continue to thrive and educate students of all races today the majority of hbcus were established in the southeastern united states alabama has the most hbcus of any state9091 as late as 1947 about one third of african americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names by 1969 illiteracy as it had been traditionally defined had been largely eradicated among younger african americans92 us census surveys showed that by 1998 89 percent of african americans aged 25 to 29 had completed a highschool education less than whites or asians but more than hispanics on many college entrance standardized tests and grades african americans have historically lagged behind whites but some studies suggest that the achievement gap has been closing many policy makers have proposed that this gap can and will be eliminated through policies such as affirmative action desegregation and multiculturalism93 the average high school graduation rate of blacks in the united states has steadily increased to 71 in 201394 separating this statistic into component parts shows it varies greatly depending upon the state and the school district examined 38 of black males graduated in the state of new york but in maine 97 graduated and exceeded the white male graduation rate by 11 percentage points95 in much of the southeastern united states and some parts of the southwestern united states the graduation rate of white males was in fact below 70 such as in florida where a 62 of white males graduated high school examining specific school districts paints an even more complex picture in the detroit school district the graduation rate of black males was 20 but 7 for white males in the new york city school district 28 of black males graduate high school compared to 57 of white males in newark countywhere 76 of black males graduated compared to 67 for white males further academic improvement has occurred in 2015 roughly 23 of all blacks have bachelors degrees in 1988 21 of whites had obtained a bachelors degree versus 11 of blacks in 2015 23 of blacks had obtained a bachelors

of ethnicity111 in 2006 the median earnings of africanamerican men was more than black and nonblack american women overall and in all educational levels112113114115116 at the same time among american men income disparities were significant the median income of africanamerican men was approximately 76 cents for every dollar of their european american counterparts although the gap narrowed somewhat with a rise in educational level112117 overall the median earnings of africanamerican men were 72 cents for every dollar earned of their asian american counterparts and 117 for every dollar earned by hispanic men112115118 on the other hand by 2006 among american women with postsecondary education africanamerican women have made significant advances the median income of africanamerican women was more than those of their asian european and hispanic american counterparts with at least some college education113114119 the us public sector is the single most important source of employment for african americans120 during 2008–2010 212 of all black workers were public employees compared with 163 of nonblack workers120 both before and after the onset of the great recession african americans were 30 more likely than other workers to be employed in the public sector120 the public sector is also a critical source of decentpaying jobs for black americans for both men and women the median wage earned by black employees is significantly higher in the public sector than in other industries120 in 1999 the median income of africanamerican families was 33255 compared to 53356 of european americans in times of economic hardship for the nation african americans suffer disproportionately from job loss and underemployment with the black underclass being hardest hit the phrase last hired and first fired is reflected in the bureau of labor statistics unemployment figures nationwide the october 2008 unemployment rate for african americans was 111121 while the nationwide rate was 65122 the income gap between black and white families is also significant in 2005 employed blacks earned 65 of the wages of whites down from 82 in 1975103 the new york times reported in 2006 that in queens new york the median income among africanamerican families exceeded that of white families which the newspaper attributed to the growth in the number of twoparent black families it noted that queens

heterosexual sex africanamerican women are 19 times more likely to contract hiv than other women131 washington dc has the nations highest rate of hivaids infection at 3 this rate is comparable to what is seen in west africa and is considered a severe epidemic132 dr ray martins chief medical officer at the whitmanwalker clinic the largest provider of hiv care in washington dc estimated that the actual underlying percent with hivaids in the city is closer to five percent132 sexuality according to a gallup survey 46 of black or africanamericans selfidentified as lgbt in 2016133 while the total portion of american adults in all ethnic groups identifying as lgbt was 41 in 2016133 the disproportionately high incidence of hivaids among africanamericans has been attributed to homophobic

africanamerican congregation in washington dc masjid malcolm shabazz in harlem new york city the majority of african americans are protestant many of whom follow the historically black churches135 the term black church refers to churches which minister to predominantly africanamerican congregations black congregations were first established by freed slaves at the end of the 17th century and later when slavery was abolished more african americans were allowed to create a unique form of christianity that was culturally influenced by african spiritual traditions136 according to a 2007 survey more than half of the africanamerican population are part of the historically black churches137 the largest protestant denomination among african americans are the baptists138 distributed mainly in four denominations the largest being the national baptist convention usa and the national baptist convention of america139 the second largest are the methodists140 the largest denominations are the african methodist episcopal church and the african methodist episcopal zion church139141 pentecostals are distributed among several different religious bodies with the church of god in christ as the largest among them by far139 about 16 of africanamerican christians are members of white protestant communions140 these denominations which include the united church of christ mostly have a 2 to 3 africanamerican membership142 there are also large numbers of roman catholics constituting 5 of the africanamerican population137 of the total number of jehovahs witnesses 22 are black135 some african americans follow islam historically between 15 and 30 of enslaved africans brought to the americas were muslims but most of these africans were converted to christianity during the era of american slavery143 during the twentieth century some african americans converted to islam mainly through the influence of black nationalist groups that preached with distinctive islamic practices including the moorish science temple of america and the largest organization the nation of islam founded in the 1930s which attracted at least 20000 people by 1963144145 prominent members included activist malcolm x and boxer muhammad ali146 malcolm x is considered the first person to start the movement among african americans towards mainstream islam after he left the nation and made the pilgrimage to mecca147 in 1975 warith deen mohammed the son of elijah muhammad took control of the nation after his fathers death and guided the majority of its members to orthodox islam148 however a few members rejected these changes in particular louis farrakhan who revived the nation of islam in 1978 based on its original teachingscitation needed africanamerican muslims constitute 20 of the total us muslim population149 the majority are sunni or orthodox muslims some of these identify under the community of w deen mohammed150151 the nation of islam led by louis farrakhan has a membership ranging from 20000–50000 members152 there are relatively few africanamerican jews estimates of their number range from 20000153 to 200000154 most of these jews are part of mainstream groups such as the reform conservative or orthodox branches of judaism although there are significant numbers of people who are part of nonmainstream jewish groups largely the black hebrew israelites whose beliefs include the claim that african americans are descended from the biblical israelites155 confirmed atheists are less than one half of onepercent similar to numbers for hispanics156157158 business african americans

commended business as a vehicle for african american advancement159 language main article african american vernacular english african american vernacular english aave is a variety dialect ethnolect and sociolect of american english commonly spoken by urban workingclass and largely bidialectal middleclass african americans160 nonlinguists sometimes call it ebonics a term that also has other meanings and connotationscitation needed african american vernacular english evolved during the antebellum period through interaction between speakers of 16th and 17th century english of great britain and ireland and various west african languages as a result the variety shares parts of its grammar and phonology with the southern american english dialect where african american vernacular english differs from standard american english sae is in certain pronunciation characteristics tense usage and grammatical structures that were derived from west african languages particularly those belonging to the nigercongo family161 virtually all habitual speakers of african american vernacular english can understand and communicate in standard american english as with all linguistic forms aaves usage is influenced by various factors including geographical educational and socioeconomic background as well as formality of setting161 additionally there are many literary uses of this variety of english particularly in africanamerican literaturecitation needed some of the new words used by the people include fleek which means on point and throwing shade which means offending someone162 genetics genomewide studies genetic clustering of 128 african americans by zakharaia et al 2009163 each vertical bar represents an individual recent surveys of african americans using a genetic testing service have found varied ancestries which show different tendencies by region and sex of ancestors these studies found that on average african americans have 732821 west african 16724 european and 08–12 native american genetic ancestry with large variation between individuals164165166 genetics websites themselves have reported similar ranges with some finding 1 or 2 percent native american ancestry and ancestrycom reporting an outlying percentage of european ancestry among african americans 29167 according to a genomewide study by bryc et al 2009 the overall ancestry of african americans was formed through historic admixture between westcentral africans more frequently females and europeans more frequently males consequently the 365 african americans in their sample have a genomewide average of 781 west african ancestry and 185 european ancestry with large variation among individuals ranging from 99 to 1 west african ancestry the west african ancestral component in african americans is most similar to that in presentday speakers from the nonbantu branches of the nigercongo nigerkordofanian family164nb 1 correspondingly montinaro et al 2014 observed that around 50 of the overall ancestry of african americans traces back to the nigercongospeaking yoruba of southwestern nigeria and southern benin reflecting the centrality of this west africa region in the atlantic slave trade the next most frequent ancestral component found among african americans was derived from great britain in keeping with historical records it constitutes a little over 10 of their overall ancestry and is most similar to the northwest european ancestral component also carried by barbadians169 zakharaia et al 2009 found a similar proportion of yoruba associated ancestry in their africanamerican samples with a minority also drawn from mandenka and bantu populations additionally the researchers observed an average european ancestry of 219 again with significant variation between individuals163 bryc et al 2009 note that populations from other parts of the continent may also constitute adequate proxies for the ancestors of some africanamerican individuals namely ancestral populations from guinea bissau senegal and sierra leone in west africa and angola in southern africa164 altogether genetic studies suggest that african americans are a multiracial people according to dna analysis led in 2006 by penn state geneticist mark d shriver around 58 percent of african americans have at least 125 european ancestry equivalent to one european greatgrandparent and hisher forebears 196 percent of african americans have at least 25 european ancestry equivalent to one european grandparent and hisher forebears and 1 percent of african americans have at least 50 european ancestry equivalent to one european parent and hisher forebears13170 according to shriver around 5 percent of african americans also have at least 125 native american ancestry equivalent to one native american greatgrandparent and hisher forebears171172 ydna according to a ydna study by sims et al 2007 the majority 60 of african americans belong to various subclades of the e3a e1b1a paternal haplogroup this is the most common genetic paternal lineage found today among westcentral african males and is also a signature of the historical bantu migrations the next most frequent ydna haplogroup observed among african americans is the r1b clade which around 15 of african americans carry this lineage is most common today among northwestern european males the remaining african americans mainly belong to the paternal haplogroup i 7 which is also frequent in northwestern europe173 mtdna according to an mtdna study by salas et al 2005 the maternal lineages of african americans are most similar to haplogroups that are today especially common in west africa 55 followed closely by westcentral africa and southwestern africa 41 the characteristic west african haplogroups l1b l2bcd and l3bd and westcentral african haplogroups l1c and l3e in particular occur at high frequencies among african americans as with the paternal dna of african americans contributions from other parts of the continent to their maternal gene pool are insignificant174 traditional names main article africanamerican names africanamerican names are part of the cultural traditions of african americans prior to the 1950s and 1960s most africanamerican names closely resembled those used within european american culture175 babies of that era were generally given a few common names with children using nicknames to distinguish the various people with the same name with the rise of 1960s civil rights movement there was a dramatic increase in names of various origins176 by the 1970s and 1980s it had become common among african americans to invent new names for themselves although many of these invented names took elements from popular existing names prefixes such as lale dade rare and jaje and suffixes like iqueiqua isha and aunawn are common as are inventive spellings for common names the book baby names now from classic to coolthe very last word on first names places the origins of la names in africanamerican culture in new orleans177 even with the rise of inventive names it is still common for african americans to use biblical historical or traditional european names daniel christopher michael david james joseph and matthew were thus among the most frequent names for africanamerican boys in 2013175178179 the name lakeisha is typically considered american in origin but has elements of it that were drawn from both french and westcentral african roots other names like latanisha jamarcus deandre and shaniqua were created in the same way punctuation marks are seen more often within africanamerican names than other american names such as the names monique and dandre175 contemporary issues see also poverty in the united states and income inequality in the united

also have the highest level of congressional representation of any minority group in the us187 a large majority of african americans support the democratic party in the 2004 presidential election democrat john kerry received 88 of the africanamerican vote compared to 11 for republican george w bush188 although there is an africanamerican lobby in foreign policy it has not had the impact that africanamerican organizations have had in domestic policy189 many african americans were excluded from electoral politics in the decades following the end of reconstruction for those that could participate until the new deal african americans were supporters of the republican party because it was republican president abraham lincoln who helped in granting freedom to american slaves at the time the republicans and democrats represented the sectional interests of the north and south respectively rather than any specific ideology and both right and left were represented equally in both parties the africanamerican trend of voting for democrats can be traced back to the 1930s during the great depression when franklin d roosevelts new deal program provided economic relief to african americans roosevelts new deal coalition turned the democratic party into an organization of the working class and their liberal allies regardless of region the africanamerican vote became even more solidly democratic when democratic presidents john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson pushed for civil rights legislation during the 1960s in 1960 nearly a third of african americans voted for republican

conservative opinions on abortion extramarital sex and raising children out of wedlock than democrats as a whole203 on financial issues however african americans are in line with democrats generally supporting a more progressive tax structure to provide more government spending on social services204 political legacy dr martin luther king jr remains the most prominent political leader in the american civil rights movement and perhaps the most influential africanamerican political figure in general african americans have fought in every war in the history of the united states205 the gains made by african americans in the civil rights movement and in the black power movement not only obtained certain rights for african americans but changed american society in farreaching and fundamentally important ways prior to the 1950s black americans in the south were subject to de jure discrimination or jim crow laws they were often the victims of extreme cruelty and violence sometimes resulting in deaths by the post world war ii era african americans became increasingly discontented with their longstanding inequality in the words of martin luther king jr african americans and their supporters challenged the nation to rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed that all men are created equal 206 the civil rights movement marked an enormous change in american social political economic and civic life it brought with it boycotts sitins nonviolent demonstrations and marches court battles bombings and other violence prompted worldwide media coverage and intense public debate forged enduring civic economic and religious alliances and disrupted and realigned the nations two major political parties over time it has changed in fundamental ways the manner in which blacks and whites interact with and relate to one another the movement resulted in the removal of codified de jure racial segregation and discrimination from american life and law and heavily

chicken with macaroni and cheese collard greens breaded fried okra and cornbread from their earliest presence in north america african americans have significantly contributed literature art agricultural skills cuisine clothing styles music language and social and technological innovation to american culture the cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the united states such as yams peanuts rice okra sorghum grits watermelon indigo dyes and cotton can be traced to west african and africanamerican influences notable examples include george washington carver who created 300 products from peanuts 118 products from sweet potatoes and 75 products from pecans and george crum a local legend associates him with the creation of the potato chip in 1853218219 soul food is a variety of cuisine popular among african americans it is closely related to the cuisine of the southern united states the descriptive terminology may have originated in the mid1960s when soul was a common definer used to describe africanamerican culture for example soul music african americans were the first peoples in the united states to make fried chicken along with scottish immigrants to the south although the scottish had been frying chicken before they emigrated they lacked the spices and flavor that african americans had used when preparing the meal the scottish american settlers therefore adopted the africanamerican method of seasoning chicken220 however fried chicken was generally a rare meal in the africanamerican community and was usually reserved for special events or celebrations221 music the king carter jazzing orchestra photographed in houston texas january 1921 chuck berry is considered a pioneer of rock and roll africanamerican music is one of the most pervasive africanamerican cultural influences in the united states today and is among the most dominant in mainstream popular music hip hop rb funk rock and roll soul blues and other contemporary

musical forms have also influenced and been incorporated into virtually every other popular music genre in the world including country and techno africanamerican genres are the most important ethnic vernacular tradition in america as they have developed independent of african traditions from which they arise more so than any other immigrant groups including europeans make up the broadest and longest lasting range of styles in america and have historically been more influential interculturally geographically and economically than other american vernacular traditions222 african americans have also had an important role in american dance bill t jones a prominent modern choreographer and dancer has included historical africanamerican themes in his work particularly in the piece last supper at uncle toms cabinthe promised land likewise alvin aileys artistic work including his revelations based on his experience growing up as an african american in the south during the 1930s has had a significant influence on modern dance another form of dance stepping is an africanamerican tradition whose performance and competition has been formalized through the traditionally black fraternities and sororities at universities223 literature and academics many africanamerican authors have written stories poems and essays influenced by their experiences as african americans africanamerican literature is a major genre in american literature famous examples include langston hughes james baldwin richard wright zora neale hurston ralph ellison nobel prize winner toni morrison and maya angelou africanamerican inventors have created many widely used devices in the world and have contributed to international innovation norbert rillieux created the technique for converting sugar cane juice into white sugar crystals moreover rillieux left louisiana in 1854 and went to france where he spent ten years working with the champollions deciphering egyptian hieroglyphics from the rosetta stone224 most slave inventors were nameless such as the slave owned by the confederate president jefferson davis who designed the ship propeller used by the confederate navy225 by 1913 over 1000 inventions were patented by black americans among the most notable inventors were jan matzeliger who developed the first machine to massproduce shoes226 and elijah mccoy who invented automatic lubrication devices for steam engines227 granville woods had 35 patents to improve electric railway systems including the first system to allow moving trains to communicate228 garrett a morgan developed the first automatic traffic signal and gas mask229 lewis howard latimer invented an improvement for the incandescent light bulb230 more recent inventors include frederick mckinley jones who invented the movable refrigeration unit for food transport in trucks and trains231 lloyd quarterman worked with six other black scientists on the creation of the atomic bomb code named the manhattan project232 quarterman also helped develop the first nuclear reactor which was used in the atomically powered submarine called the nautilus233 a few other notable examples include the first successful open heart surgery performed by dr daniel hale williams234 and the air conditioner patented by frederick mckinley jones231 dr mark dean holds three of the original nine patents on the computer on which all pcs are based235236237 more current contributors include otis boykin whose inventions included several novel methods for manufacturing electrical components that found use in applications such as guided missile systems and computers238 and colonel frederick gregory who was not only the first black astronaut pilot but the person who redesigned the cockpits for the last three space shuttles gregory was also on the team that pioneered the microwave instrumentation landing system239 terminology general this parade float displayed the word afroamerican in 1911 the term african american carries important political overtones earlier terms used to describe americans of african ancestry referred more to skin color than to ancestry and were conferred upon the group by colonists and americans of european ancestry people with dark skins were considered inferior in fact and in law the terms such as colored person of color or negro were included in the wording of various laws and legal decisions which some thought were being used as tools of white supremacy and oppression240 there developed among blacks in america a growing desire for a term of selfidentification of their own choosingcitation needed michelle obama was the first lady of the united states she and her husband president barack obama are the first african americans to hold these positions in the 1980s the term african american was advanced on the model of for example germanamerican or irishamerican to give descendants of american slaves and other american blacks who lived through the slavery era a heritage and a cultural base240 the term was popularized in black communities around the country via word of mouth and ultimately received mainstream use after jesse jackson publicly used the term in front of a national audience in 1988 subsequently major media outlets adopted its use240 surveys show that the majority of black americans have no preference for african american versus black american241 although they have a slight preference for black american in personal settings and african american in more formal settings242 many african americans have expressed a preference for the term african american because it was formed in the same way as the terms for the many other ethnic groups currently living in the nation some argued further that because of the historical circumstances surrounding the capture enslavement and systematic attempts to deafricanize blacks in the united states under chattel slavery most african americans are unable to trace their ancestry to a specific african nation hence the entire continent serves as a geographic marker the term african american embraces panafricanism as earlier enunciated by prominent african thinkers such as marcus garvey w e b du bois and george padmore the term afrousonian and variations of such are more rarely used243244 identity since 1977 in an attempt to keep up with changing social opinion the united states government has officially classified black people revised to black or african american in 1997 as having origins in any of the black racial groups of africa245 other federal offices such as the united states census bureau adhere to the office of management and budget standards on race in its data collection and tabulations efforts246 in preparation for the united states 2010 census a marketing and outreach plan called 2010 census integrated communications campaign plan icc recognized and defined african americans as black people born in the united states from the icc perspective african americans are one of three groups of black people in the united states247 the icc plan was to reach the three groups by acknowledging that each group has its own sense of community that is based on geography and ethnicity248 the best way to market the census process toward any of the three groups is to reach them through their own unique communication channels and not treat the entire black population of the us as though they are all african americans with a single ethnic and geographical background the us department of justice federal bureau of investigation categorizes black or africanamerican people as a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of africa through racial categories used in the ucr program adopted from the statistical policy handbook 1978 and published by the office of federal statistical policy and standards us department of commerce derived from the 1977 office of management and budget classification249 admixture see also miscegenation § united states multiracial american and onedrop rule historically race mixing between black and white people was taboo in the united states socalled antimiscegenation laws barring blacks and whites from marrying or having sex were established in colonial america as early as 1691250 and endured in many southern states until the supreme court ruled them unconstitutional in loving v virginia 1967 the taboo among american whites surrounding whiteblack relations is a historical consequence of the oppression and racial segregation of african americans251 historian david brion davis notes the racial mixing that occurred during slavery was frequently attributed by the planter class to the lowerclass white males but davis concludes that there is abundant evidence that many slaveowners sons of slaveowners and overseers took black mistresses or in effect raped the wives and daughters of slave families252 a famous example was thomas jeffersons mistress sally hemings253 harvard university historian henry louis gates jr wrote in 2009 that african americans are a racially mixed or mulatto people—deeply and overwhelmingly so see genetics after the emancipation proclamation chinese american men married africanamerican women in high proportions to their total marriage numbers due to few chinese american women being in the united states254 african slaves and their descendants have also had a history of cultural exchange and intermarriage with native americans255 although they did not necessarily retain social cultural or linguistic ties to native peoples256 there are also increasing intermarriages and offspring between nonhispanic blacks and hispanics of any race especially between puerto ricans and african americans americanborn blacks257 according to author mm drymon many african americans identify as having scotsirish ancestry258 racially mixed marriages have become increasingly accepted in the united states since the civil rights movement and up to the present day259 approval in national opinion polls have risen from 36 in 1978 to 48 in 1991 65 in 2002 77 in 2007260 a gallup poll conducted in 2013 found that 84 of whites and 96 of blacks approved of interracial marriage and 87 overall261 the africanamerican experience in her book the end of blackness as well as in an essay on the liberal website salon262 author debra dickerson has argued that the term black should refer strictly to the descendants of africans who were brought to america as slaves and not to the sons and daughters of black immigrants who lack that ancestry in her opinion president barack obama who is the son of a kenyan immigrant although technically black is not africanamerican262263 she makes the argument that grouping all people of african descent together regardless of their unique ancestral circumstances would inevitably deny the lingering effects of slavery within the american community of slave descendants in addition to denying black immigrants recognition of their own unique ancestral backgrounds lumping us all together dickerson wrote erases the significance of slavery and continuing racism while giving the appearance of progress262 similar viewpoints have been expressed by stanley crouch in a new york daily news piece charles steele jr of the southern christian leadership conference264 and africanamerican columnist david ehrenstein of the los angeles times who accused white liberals of flocking to blacks who were magic negros a term that refers to a black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream white as cultural protagonistsdrivers agenda265 ehrenstein went on to say hes there to assuage white guilt they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in american history265 former secretary of state condoleezza rice who was famously mistaken for a recent american immigrant by french president nicolas sarkozy266 said descendants of slaves did not get much of a head start and i think you continue to see some of the effects of that she has also rejected an immigrant designation for african americans and instead prefers the term black or white to denote the african and european us founding populations267 terms no longer in common use before the independence of the thirteen colonies until the abolition of slavery in 1865 an africanamerican slave was commonly known as a negro free negro was the legal status in the territory of an africanamerican person who was not a slave268 the term colored later also began to be used until the second quarter of the 20th century when it was considered outmoded and generally gave way again to the exclusive use of negro by the 1940s the term was commonly capitalized negro but by the mid1960s it was considered disparaging by the end of the 20th century negro had come to be considered inappropriate and was rarely used and perceived as a pejorative269270 the term is rarely used by younger black people but remained in use by many older african americans who had grown up with the term particularly in the southern us271 the term remains in use in some contexts such as the united negro college fund an american philanthropic organization that funds scholarships for black students and general scholarship funds for 39 private historically black colleges and universities as well as in latin america where spanish and portuguese are spoken pronounced slightly differently it is the word for the color black and is rarely perceived as a pejorativecitation needed there are many other deliberately insulting terms many were in common use eg nigger but had become unacceptable in normal discourse before the end of the 20th century one exception is the use among the black community of the slur nigger rendered as nigga representing the pronunciation of the word in african american vernacular english this usage has been popularized by the rap and hiphop music cultures and is used as part of an ingroup lexicon and speech it is not necessarily derogatory and when used among black people the word is often used to mean homie or friendcitation needed acceptance of intragroup usage of the word nigga is still debated although it has established a foothold among younger generations the naacp denounces the use of both nigga and nigger mixedrace usage of nigga is still considered taboo particularly if the speaker is white however trends indicate that usage of the term in intragroup settings is increasing even among white youth due to the popularity of rap and hip hop culture272 notable people for a more
