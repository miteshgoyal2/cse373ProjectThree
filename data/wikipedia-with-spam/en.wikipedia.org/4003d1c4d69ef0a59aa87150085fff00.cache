repackaging for the digital airwaves shows featured on their terrestrial radio stations historyedit expressing and debating political opinions has been a staple of radio since the mediums infancy aimee semple mcpherson began her radio broadcasts in the early 1920s and even purchased her own station kfsg which went on the air in february 1924 by the mid1930s controversial radio priest father charles coughlins radio broadcasts were reaching millions per week there was also a national current events forum called americas town meeting of the air which broadcast once a week starting in 1935 it featured panel discussions from some of the biggest newsmakers and was among the first shows to allow audience participation members of the studio audience could question the guests or even heckle them2 talk radio as a listenerparticipation format has existed since the 1930s john j anthony 190270 was an announcer and dj on new yorks wmrj it was located in the merrick radio store at 12 new york boulevard in jamaica long island after some marital troubles refusing to pay alimony and child support he sought professional help and began his own radio series where listeners would call in with their problems in 1930 radio historians consider this the first instance of talkradio3 while working for new yorks wmca in 1945 barry gray was bored with playing music and put a telephone receiver up to his microphone to talk with bandleader woody herman this was soon followed by listener callins and gray is often billed as the hot mama of talk radio herb jepko also was a pioneer4 author bill cherry proposed george roy clough as the first to invite listeners to argue politics on a callin radio show at kluf his station in galveston texas as a way to bring his own political views into listeners homes he later became mayor of galveston cherry gives no specific date but the context of events and history of the station would seem to place it also in the 1940s perhaps earlier the format was the classic mode in which the announcer gave the topic for that day and listeners called in to debate the issue5 in 1948 alan courtney—new york disk jockey and cocomposer of the popular song joltin joe dimaggio—began a callin program for the storer station in miami florida wgbs and then on miamis wqam winz and wckr the alan courtney open phone forum flourished as an avowedly conservative and anticommunist political forum with a coverage area over the southeastern us and cuba joe pyne john nebel jean shepherd and jerry williams wmexboston were among the first to explore the medium in the 1950s a major breakthrough in talk radio occurred in 1960 at klac in los angeles alan henry a young broadcaster still in his early thirties had been hired by john kluge president of metromedia in 1963 henry had previously worked in such diverse markets as miami florida waterloo iowa hartford connecticut and st louis missouri klac was dead last in the ratings but kluge wanted a big metromedia presence in los angeles he sent henry from new york to los angeles to turn klac into a success the first thing that henry did was hire the legendary morning team of loehman and barclay henry had built a strong relationship with programmer jim lightfoot who had joined him when henry was in miami a unique opportunity presented itself when joe pyne who had begun his career as a radio talk personality in pennsylvania was fired by kabc in los angeles speculation was that pyne was too controversial and confrontational for the abc corporate culture henry hired pyne on the spot and paid him 25000 a year which was then a huge salary for a radio personality pyne was given the night show on klac part of the agreement with pyne was that henry and lightfoot would give him broad control of his program content the show was an immediate success henry encouraged the confrontation with listeners and guests for which pyne became famous pyne coined the line go gargle with razor blades for guests with whom he disagreed the pyne show was the beginning of the confrontational talk format that later spread across the radio spectrum at one point in the 1960s the joe pyne show was syndicated on over 250 radio stations in the united states in an odd turn of events pynes radio show lead him to television henry was having a regular business dinner with john kluge at the gloucester house in new york city and the subject of the success of joe pyne was the center of the conversation henry suggested to kluge that joe pyne should be put on metromedias newly acquired tv station in los angeles kttvtv kluge told henry to speak to kttvtv general manager al kriven but henry had already done that and he told kluge that kriven adamantly refused the next day kluge telephoned al kriven and pyne soon thereafter became the nations first controversial late night talk television host the joe pyne show on kttvtv quickly shot to the top of the ratings the format later proliferated on cable television with a variety of new hosts many of them taking on a similar persona to joe pyne joe pyne and alan henry were major factors in establishing a new trend in radio and television programming alan henry elaborates on the launching of joe pyne on klac radio and kttvtv in his memoir a man and his medium two radio stations—kmox 1120 am in st louis missouri and kabc 790 am in los angeles—adopted an alltalk show format in 1960 and both claim to be the first to have done so kabc station manager ben hoberman and kmox station manager robert hyland independently developed the alltalk format ktkk 630 am in salt lake city then known as ksxx adopted a fulltime talk schedule in 1965 and is the third station in the country to have done so ksxx started with all local talent and ktkk which now airs on 1640 am has a larger portion of its schedule featuring local talent than most other stations that run a full schedule of talk in the 1970s and early 1980s as many listeners abandoned am music formats for the high fidelity sound of fm radio the talk radio format began to catch on in more large cities former music stations such as klif dallas texas wlw cincinnati ohio whas louisville kentucky wham rochester new york wls chicago illinois kfi los angeles california wrko boston massachusetts wkbw buffalo new york and wabc new york new york made the switch to alltalk as their ratings slumped due to listener migration to the fm band since the turn of the 21st century with many music listeners now migrating to digital music platforms such as pandora radio sirius xm radio and the numerous variations of the ipod talk radio has been expanding on the fm side of the dial as well hot talkedit hot talk also called fm talk or shock talk6 is a talk radio format geared predominantly to a male demographic between the ages of 18–49 the subject matter generally consists of subjects pertaining to pop culture rather than the political talk found on am radio hosts of hot talk shows are usually known as shock jocks clear channel communications now iheartmedia 2015 has a select few hot talk stations under the moniker real radio while cbs radio once had a larger chain of hot talkers known as free fm though the brand was abandoned after a posthoward stern attempt to network the format failed within a year it is usually found on fm radio active rock classic rock and country stations in morning drive as the actual hot talk formatted stations have only achieved mediocre success as a whole compared to am or conservative talk radio or even fm music radio more recently the genre has been showing up on satellite radio and podcasting media that are beyond the reach of the fccs obscenity rules allowing the hosts of such shows to be as vulgar and outrageous as they desire advertising tends to be more limited on these media because of reliance on subscription revenues in the case of satellite and smaller audience and fewer connections to advertisers in the case of internetonly shows which usually lack the full sales departments of terrestrial and satellite broadcasters other us hosts specialize in talk radio comedy such as phil hendrie who voices his own fictional guests and occasionally does parodies of other programs politically oriented talk radioedit see also conservative talk radio and progressive talk radio the united states saw dramatic growth in the popularity of talk radio during the 1990s due to the repeal of the federal communications commissions postwar fairness doctrine of 1949 in 1987 the mandate of the fairness doctrine was to require that audiences were exposed to a diversity of viewpoints it had required the holders of broadcast licenses to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that was in the commissions view honest equitable and balanced its repeal provided an opportunity for a kind of partisan political programming with commercial appeal that had not previously existed the most successful pioneer in the early 1990s talk radio movement in the us was the politically conservative commentator rush limbaugh limbaughs success demonstrated that there was a nationwide market for passionately delivered conservative polemic on contemporary news events and social trends and changed the face of how the talk radio business was conducted unrestrained by the fairness doctrine cheering for ones political party and especially against the other had become popular entertainment which rapidly changed the way politics nationally was discussed perceived and conducted other radio talk show hosts who describe themselves as either conservative or libertarian have also had success as nationally syndicated hosts including hugh hewitt sean hannity jon arthur glenn beck michael medved laura ingraham neal boortz michael savage bill oreilly larry gaiters and mark levin the salem radio network syndicates a group of religiously oriented republican activists including evangelical christian hugh hewitt and jewish conservatives dennis prager and michael medved these are mostly distributed in a 24hour network format among salems own stations and they generally earn ratings much less than their syndicated counterparts in the summer of 2007 conservative talk show hosts mobilized public opposition to the mccainkennedy immigration reform bill which eventually failed7 conservative hosts limbaugh ingraham bennett prager hannity beck levin and hewitt coalesced around endorsing former massachusetts governor mitt romney for president at the end of january 2008 after fred thompson the described favorite of some of the hosts dropped out in an effort to oppose the nomination of senator john mccain8 however romney suspended his campaign in february of the same year and endorsed mccain during the primaries limbaugh in particular had endorsed a plan to do whatever it took to prolong the democrats nomination by encouraging political conservatives to cross over to the democrats and voting for the trailing candidate a plan he called operation chaos conservative talk show hosts also lent their unified support for congressional candidate doug hoffman a conservative thirdparty candidate who was running in new yorks 23rd congressional district special election 2009 against a liberal republican dierdre scozzafava and a mainstream democrat bill owens the unified support from the conservative base helped propel hoffman to frontrunner status and effectively killed scozzafavas campaign forcing her to drop out of the race several days before the election this effort backfired on the conservative hosts as the democratic candidate owens won in part thanks to scozzafavas endorsement of owens local hosts such as los angeless john and ken have also proven effective in influencing the political landscape other hosts other stylesedit libertarians such as dennis miller based in los angeles jon arthur host of jon arthur live based in florida patti brooks kgmi based in the pacific northwest free talk live based in new hampshire penn jillette based in las vegas jay severin based in boston massachusetts and mark davis based in ft worth and dallas texas have also achieved some success many of these hosts also publish books write newspaper columns appear on television and give public lectures limbaugh again was a pioneer of this model of multimedia punditry there had been some precursors for talk radio show stars such as the los angelesarea controversialist joe pyne who would attack callers on his program in the early 1960s – one of his famous insults was gargle with razor blades the similar bob grant in new york city and wally george in southern california9 talk radio also included personal relationship consultants such as laura schlessinger and barbara de angelis both heard on kfi am in los angeles host larry elder on kabc am who was a lawyer prior to entering the talk radio market see also lawyer norman goldman under the progressive talk section not political but certainly prevalent in talk radio is leo laporte who offers consumer advice particularly related to technical computer topics with many talk shows across the opinion spectrum losing ratings and revenues businessreal estate advice shows paidfor health supplement presentations and religious programming has emerged in addition to sports and news talk while politicallyoriented talk is still heard on the am dial mostly the conservative format it has seen some expanding onto the fm dial one notable example was wpgb in pittsburgh which switched to a talk format in 2004 after years of having several different music formats going so far as to brand itself as fm news talk 1047 due to the relative uncommonness of politicallyoriented talk on the fm side of the dial even in 2013 while fm talk in general has expanded additionally at the time wpgb was the only fm radio station in pittsburgh the nations 22nd largest market to have a talk format owned by clear channel and stylized as one of clear channels typical conservativeleaning am talk stations wpgbs ratings were steadily high since during its time as a talk station whereas the stations numerous music formats were among the lowest in the pittsburgh market before switching10 clear channel which owns wpgb has been moving away from putting talk radio on the fm dial wpgb fired its morning show in december 2013 and switched back to music in august 2014 selling the format rights to am station wjas liberal talk radioedit politically liberal talk radio aimed at a national audience also emerged in the mid2000s air america a network featuring the al franken show was founded in 2004 it billed itself as a progressive alternative to the conservative talk radio shows some prominent examples of liberal talk radio shows either previously or currently in national syndication include dial global talk show hosts ed schultz left his radio show and is currently on msnbc tv stephanie miller11 thom hartmann12 and bill press13 norman goldman14 not with dial global and is a selfdescribed independent is still included on syndication stations see wcpt am goldman began as the highrating fillin host and senior legal analyst for ed schultz prior to launching his own show the young turks fox former cohost of hannity and colmes alan colmes first amendment radio network libertarian host jon arthur and mike malloy progressive radio wfte fms dorothy and dick and premieres randi rhodes not on radio 2015 in some markets local liberal hosts have existed for years such as the british talk host michael jackson who was on the air at kabc in los angeles beginning in 1968 and is currently at ksur bernie ward in san francisco jack ellery in new jersey and tampa dave ross in seattle and marc germain in los angeles a few earlier syndicated programs were hosted by prominent democrats who were not experienced broadcasters such as jim hightower jerry brown mario cuomo and alan dershowitz these met with limited success and air america has been faced with various legal and financial problems air america was sold to a new owner in march 2007 hired wellknown programmer david bernstein and began its rebirth bernstein subsequently left in early 2008 but the struggling network remained on the air with a revamped lineup on january 21 2010 air america radio ceased live programming citing a difficulty with the current economic environment and announced that it would file for chapter 7 bankruptcy production and liquidate itself the network ended operations on january 25 2010citation needed clear channeliheartmedia with nearly 1300 radio stations under its ownership – along with other owners – has in recent years added more liberal talk stations to their portfolio these have primarily come from the conversion of am facilities most of which formerly had adult standards formats many complaints all radio stations are required by the fcc to maintain in their public files copies of all correspondence from the public relating to station operations – for a period of three years from receipt have been received from fans of this musical genre tony bennett frank sinatra big band music etc – but the leftleaning talk programming leans toward a much younger demographic a group that advertisers covet more recently however clear channel has been dropping liberal formats in favor of their own fox sports radio network by 2014 most liberal talk stations had abandoned the format forcing hosts to find other ways to distribute their programming liberal opinion radio has long existed on the pacifica network though only available in a small number of major cities and in formats that more often act as a volunteerrun community forum than as a platform for charismatic hosts who would be likely to attract a large audience the one major host to become popular on the network is amy goodman whose democracy now interview and journalism program is broadcast nationwide conservative critics have long complained that the longformat news programming on national public radio npr shows a liberal bias although this is disputed by fairness and accuracy in reporting fair a progressive media criticism organization which found that for example representatives of think tanks to the right of center outnumbered those to the left of center by more than four to one 62 appearances to 1515 national public radio itself denies any partisan agenda16 politically oriented talk programs on the network are in the mold of talk of the nation which is designed to be a soundboard for the varied opinions of listeners sports talkedit sports talk radio can be found locally and nationally in the us as of 2013 five national fulltime sports talk networks exist the oldest existing network dating to 1991 is sb nation radio although it has only been branded as such since 2016 market leader espn radio followed shortly thereafter in 1992 followed by fox sports radio ca 2000 and the nearconcurrent entries of cbs sports radio and nbc sports radio in late 2012 and early 2013 most of these however air on weak lowbudget am stations the most successful sports talk stations operate primarily with local programs and supplement their programming with broadcasting of sports events usually involving the local teams in the major professional sports leagues this adds significant expenses to the stations operations local stations may also hire personalities with polarizing opinions about sports topics and athletes to make some kind of national impact that might turn off listeners and in large markets sports talk stations may be made up of personalities who pay stations for their show time and their own advertising disallowing any natural flow between each program along with instation competitions about whose show has the most impact ratingsedit pew researchers found in 2004 that 17 of the public regularly listens to talk radio this audience is mostly
