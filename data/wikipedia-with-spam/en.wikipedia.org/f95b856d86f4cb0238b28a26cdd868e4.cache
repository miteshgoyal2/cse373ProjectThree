pensacola florida baldwin was the founding pastor by 1985 the church had gone through repeated building programs and been recognized by president ronald reagan for its unusual growth and influence4 political activityedit prior to joining the republican party in 1980 baldwin had been a registered democrat like his father3 from 1980 to 1984 baldwin served as pensacola chairman and then state executive director of the florida moral majority organized by the rev jerry falwell of lynchburg virginia4 baldwin helped carry the state twice for reagan electors he says he helped falwell register some 50000 christian conservative voters5 baldwins father ed a lifelong democrat expressed grudging admiration for what he saw as reagans honesty and courage2 in august 1994 baldwin had a callin radio show on the christian patriot network6 in 2000 however baldwin left the republican party on grounds that the bush–cheney ticket was too liberal baldwin has said that many evangelical minds similarly to ministers in nazi germany have seemingly given bush the aura of an american fuhrer7 he considered himself an independent affiliated with the constitution party3 at about this time baldwin began hosting a local daily onehour currentevents radio program chuck baldwin live which continues today nationwide on the genesis communications network he writes a semiweekly editorial column carried on its website on vdare chuckbaldwinlivecom8 and in several newspapers he has also appeared on numerous television shows and radio shows in churches across the country and as the keynote speaker for the 50th anniversary of dday at naval air station pensacola4 2004 vice presidential campaignedit in the 2004 presidential election baldwin was the running mate of michael peroutka of maryland and was the candidate for us vice president on the constitution party ticket the alaskan independence party ticket and other tickets and qualified writein slots in 42 states the two ran on a platform of for god family and the republic the peroutka–baldwin campaign publicly spoke out against abortion9 women in the military10 and the iraq war11 and emphasized the bible traditional family values and the need for constitutionally limited government on august 14 2004 the clarion call to converge committee hosted discussions of potential strategic merger among the america first party the american independent party and the independent american party invited constitution party chair jim clymer was unable to attend due to hurricane charley while the committee found the meeting favorable toward some party merger12 afp national chairman dan charles saw other forms of party cooperation to be more likely13 in the end the four parties succeeded in uniting to endorse peroutka–baldwin as their 2004 presidential ticket peroutka was also endorsed by many paleoconservatives the alaskan independence party14 the league of the south accepted by peroutka at its 2004 national convention the southern party of georgia15 samuel t francis16 alex jones17 howard phillips18 and taki theodoracopulos19 pat buchanan also stated there was a chance he would vote for peroutka counting them as a buchananite party20 but eventually endorsed bush21 the ticket came in fifth with 143630 votes 01222 and spent 72822123 somewhat less per vote than either george w bush or john kerry it was the only third party to increase its share of the vote in 2004 interim activityedit in the constitution partys april 2006 national convention in tampa florida a heated disaffiliation vote forced members to choose between one of two prolife positions the assembly voted not to disaffiliate the independent american party of nevada over the more exceptive position of its gubernatorial candidate christopher h hansen baldwin voted in favor of disaffiliation favoring the more conservative position baldwin remained with the party but several conservative state parties subsequently voted to leave the national party believing it to have unacceptably compromised its prolife platform24 rump factions have been orchestrated by the national constitution party in some of these states on august 30 2007 baldwin wrote an informal endorsement for ron paul for the gop nomination conservative republicans have only one choice for president in 2008 congressman ron paul of texas25 more formal endorsement of paul came in a december video26 that same month baldwin said unfortunately it has been the christian rights blind support for president bush in particular and the republican party in general that has precipitated a glaring and perhaps fatal defect the christian right cannot or will not honestly face the real danger confronting these united states on the whole they fail to understand the issues that are critical to our nations—and their own—survival sadly this is what the christian right just doesnt get ninety percent of the time it doesnt matter to a tinkers dam whether a republican or democrat wins the white house all the prolife profamily traditionalvalues conservative talk is just that talk republicans use conservative rhetoric the same way democrats use liberal rhetoric neither party believes what they are telling their constituents they merely say what constituents want to hear in order to get elected after which they set about to do what their elitist globalist manipulators tell them to do5 2008 presidential campaignedit main article chuck baldwin presidential campaign 2008 baldwin speaking at an event in reno nevada baldwins vice presidential run and peroutkas withdrawal from the national constitution party led to active 2006 speculation that baldwin would seek the presidential nomination in 2008 baldwin responded in october that i have learned to never say never but i have no desire to run it would require several miraculous signs of reassurance that frankly i cannot see happening however i am always open to gods will27 he repeated this stance through march 200828 baldwin announced on april 10 two weeks before the national convention was held in kansas city missouri that he would make himself available for the partys nomination at the convention while not running but continuing to seek gods will2930 a nolan chart writer conveyed speculation that baldwins availability may have been responsive to the sudden candidacy of former ambassador alan keyes who strongly favored the iraq war31 baldwin a noninterventionist admitted others have urged me to place my name in nomination30 in a convention speech party founder howard phillips endorsed baldwin and controversially referred to keyes as a neocon and a toorecent republican32 baldwin was nominated on april 26 2008 after what was described as the most contentious battle in the partys 16year history33 he received 3838 votes ahead of keyes who drew 1257 votes from delegates34 keyes had abandoned the republicans for the constitution party one month before the constitution party convention33 much as baldwin had done in 2000 party members such as national chairman jim clymer said baldwins stands were more in line with party thinking33 baldwin asked the convention to nominate bankruptcy attorney darrell castle of tennessee as his running mate and this request was honored35 after ron paul withdrew from the republican campaign in june he remained neutral about making a presidential endorsement on september 10 paul held a national press club conference at which baldwin green party nominee cynthia mckinney and independent candidate ralph nader all agreed on four principles—quickly ending the iraq war protecting privacy and civil liberties stopping increases in the national debt and investigating the federal reserve—and on their opposition to the democratic and republican parties ignoring these issues36 pauls advice at the conference was to vote for whichever thirdparty candidate one has the most affinity to because we must maximize the total votes of those rejecting the two major candidates37 however on september 22 2008 paul stated his neutrality was due to my respect and friendship and support from both the constitution and libertarian party members and im a tenterm republican congressman it is not against the law to participate in more than one political party paul then gave his endorsement to baldwin unsolicited advice from the libertarian party candidate has persuaded me to reject my neutral stance in the november election im supporting chuck baldwin the constitution party candidate38 paul later clarified that though he would vote for baldwin he recognized the diversity of his support base and could not bind anyones conscience a former paul primary backer houston term limits pioneer clymer wright also contributed to the baldwin campaign39 baldwin wrote specifically against the candidacies of barack obama and john mccain40 and those of vicepresidential nominees sarah palin and joe biden41 2012 campaign for lieutenant governoredit in november 2011 republican montana gubernatorial candidate bob fanning selected chuck baldwin as his running mate42 baldwin withdrew his candidacy for lieutenant governor on february 12 2012 several months before the june primary43 2012 presidential nominationedit in july 2012 the reform party of the united states kansas affiliate nominated baldwin as its presidential candidate though andre barnett was the national candidate baldwin received 5017 votes or 043 of the total popular vote in kansas move to montanaedit in 2010 baldwin retired from his position as pastor of crossroad baptist church and announced his intention to move to montana because he believed god had told him that the mountain states were the tip of the spear in the freedom fight44 in march 2011 he wrote an article in support of the american redoubt strategic relocation movement originated by novelist and blogger james wesley rawles this plan designates five western states idaho montana wyoming eastern oregon and eastern washington as a safe haven for conservative christians and jews4546 in a june 9 2011 article baldwin outlined his reasons for choosing the flathead valley of western montana for his familys home he cited montanas freedomloving people its recognition of the right to keep and bear arms and a feeling of strong conviction following prayer47 political positionsedit foreign policyedit baldwin supports american sovereignty and is a staunch opponent of what he sees as the new world order he has stated that fighting against oneworld government is his top priority he believes globalism in government has led to many connected threats and issues among which he lists illegal immigration the united nations the north atlantic treaty organization the north american free trade agreement cafta the north american union the transtexas corridor the iraq war china48 the security and prosperity partnership and the free trade area of the americas49 he would also effect united states withdrawal from the united nations and has pledged to push the un out of its new york city offices33 baldwin believes that the invasion and occupation of iraq was absolutely unnecessary50 and has said his presidency would result in troop withdrawal from iraq33 he has written that the mexican government is deliberately and systematically working to destabilize and undermine the very fabric and framework of american society51 he strongly opposes amnesty for illegal immigrants and would try to end illegal immigration33 baldwin has suggested reopening the investigation into the september 11 attacks believing that the 911 truth movement has a right to have alternative 911 theories investigated including those that raise the possibility of us government involvement in the attacks52 baldwin has been an avid critic of neoconservatism535455 economyedit baldwin says he would end all federal income taxes and phase out the internal revenue service33 in an interview he said what i would propose is an acrosstheboard general 10 percent tariff on all imports and that would meet the constitutions prescription for financing the federal government—duties imposts tariffs56 which he claims would also help keep jobs in the united states57 his website also says that a tariff on foreign imports based on the difference between the foreign items cost of production abroad and the cost of production of a similar item produced in the united states would be a constitutional step toward a fair trade policy that would protect american jobs and at the same time raise revenue for our national government58 he has said that as president he would streamline the federal government and tap oil reserves in alaska the dakotas and the gulf of mexico he believes the united states should return to the gold standard33 states rightsedit baldwin believes that the south was right in the war between the states and that the leaders of the confederacy were not racists3 he uses the term war for southern independence59 he bemoans george w bushs failure to rescind executive orders by bill clinton that appear to undermine states rights and private property rights60 individual libertiesedit baldwin believes the federal war on terror and war on drugs are mostly a cover for powerhungry big government zealots to trample constitutional government and squash freedoms and liberties which are supposed to be protected by the bill of rights and declaration of independence61 he opposes the patriot act and related legislation and orders saying that it deprives the people of their rights secured under the fourth and fifth amendments under the guise of combating terrorism or protecting national security62 in relation to airplane captain don carty profiling a customers credentials and behavior baldwin stated that profiling of all sorts is a very necessary tool for effective law enforcement only morons would try to hamper a lawmans ability to bring criminals to justice by removing this tool from them63 regarding the separation of church and state baldwin believes that america was deliberately and distinctively founded as a haven for christians64 and he supports the public display of the ten commandments in government buildings he says that freedom of association in health care is important i strongly support the freedom of choice of practitioner and treatment for all citizens for their health care the government should not have the power to force people to receive immunizations or vaccinations65 he also would eliminate the food and drug administration as unconstitutional66 baldwin supports freedom for homeschooling and private schooling and wants to disband the us department of education67 he says that he would be the best friend homeschoolers have ever had in the white house33 baldwin is a strong supporter of the second amendment and he believes that the right to keep and bear arms should not be infringed by the government a baldwin administration will uphold the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms and will oppose attempts to prohibit ownership of guns by lawabiding citizens and further will stand against all laws which would require the registration of guns or ammunition richard henry lee a signer of the declaration once said to preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be taught alike especially when young how to use them just as the right to bear arms is necessary in the defense against tyranny so too is that same right vital for the purpose of selfdefense firearms are used 60 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives the vast majority of the time 92 the mere presence of a firearm helps to avert a major crime from occurring that is what congressman roscoe bartlett rmd concluded after extensive research according to rep bartlett the number of defensive uses is four times the number of crimes reported committed with guns68 baldwin had already begun promoting militia movements on his radio show as early as 19956 he says that in his opinion people like morris dees head of the southern poverty law center try to pander the market of fear trying to convince everybody that anyone with a gun any person who wants to own a gun and anyone who would consider themselves part of a citizen militia is a threat to our government and to our society69 baldwin firmly opposes abortion and roe v wade he favors ron pauls sanctity of life act70 and says his presidency would end abortion33 he takes a critical view of the federal governments handling of randy weaver the branch davidians and hutaree71 personal viewsedit baldwin has several beliefs typically distinctive of independent baptists such as the primacy of the local new testament church premillennial dispensationalism counting homosexuality as a moral perversion strict abstinence from drinking and smoking and strict diet and exercise3 he believes that america has evolved to a matriarchal society72 and that it is losing the inner toughness of masculinity73 baldwin says his only organizational memberships are to his church the constitution party gun owners of america and the national rifle association3 in 2002 he wrote a booklet what every christian should know about islam baldwin summarizes muslim persecution of christians by saying only communism rivals islam in sheer numbers of people persecuted and killed74 in his spare time baldwin enjoys hunting recreational fishing and watching the green bay packers3 among his favorite movies are the passion of the christ75 and gods and generals stating that the latter has the power to change the hearts of millions of people who disdain the old confederacy who misunderstand southern slavery and who hold christianity in contempt76 bibliographyedit baldwin chuck ed 2001 the freedom documents abigail adams john adams samuel adams patrick henry robert e lee abraham lincoln thomas
