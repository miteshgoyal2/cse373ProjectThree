main article republican party vice presidential candidate selection 1980 reagan waited until the convention in july to announce his choice of a running mate gerald ford and a possible copresidencyedit on july 16 gerald ford consults with bob dole howard baker and bill brock before making a decision to ultimately decline reagans offer during the convention the possibility of choosing former president gerald ford as the vicepresidential nominee was given at least some consideration ford asked for certain powers and prerogatives that have been described as making ford a copresident had he been chosen45 negotiations for the terms of such an arrangement were held at the detroit plaza hotel4 these included the return of henry kissinger as secretary of state and the appointment of alan greenspan as secretary of the treasury in a package deal45 on april 16 ford was interviewed by walter cronkite according to bob schieffer the whole convention came to a stop when after being asked by cronkite ford did not dismiss rumors that reagan was considering him as a running mate however negotiations ultimately fell apart later that day when the two sides could not come to an agreement and ultimately george bush was chosen less than 24 hours before the ticket was announced45 the vice presidential voteedit even though reagan had taken the unprecedented step of announcing his vp choice from the podium of the convention himself some delegates still resented bush for having the effrontery to defeat reagan in a number of primaries and especially the iowa caucuses there was some scattering and a minor challenge which as seen below went nowhere this would be the last time during the 20th century that the bottom half of the ticket would be contested as the rules would be changed in 1988 to prevent this from happening the following had their names placed in nomination us senator jesse helms of north carolina former us representative george bush of texas republican
