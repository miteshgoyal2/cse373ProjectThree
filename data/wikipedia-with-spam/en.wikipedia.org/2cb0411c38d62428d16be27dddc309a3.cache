outside projects including a deal to promote la gear sneakers he also planned to release two greatest hits packages decade 1979–1989 and decade 1980–1990 comprising hits from his studio albums off the wall thriller and bad plus unreleased demos and new songs including a cover of the beatles song strawberry fields forever in 1988 cbs records was acquired by sony music sony music would now distribute records by artists who had recorded for cbs subsidiaries including epic and columbia in march 1991 days after his sister janet jackson had signed a 32 million deal with virgin records jackson signed with sony music for a reported 50 million the most lucrative contract in music history jacksons stipulations for the contract were that he must release at least three studio albums dangerous the second disc of history and invincible respectively a remix album blood on the dance floor history in the mix two greatest hits collections the first disc of history and number ones and a box set the ultimate collection recordingedit recording sessions for dangerous took place at ocean wayrecord ones studio 2 in los angeles starting on june 25 1990 and ended at both larrabee north and ocean way studios on october 29 1991 making it at sixteen months the most extensive recording of jacksons career at the time where before he usually took six months after jackson and bottrell began work on some songs including an early version of dangerous he decided to recruit teddy riley to overlook some of the albums production for the first time since 1979 jackson was without longtime producer quincy jones who had produced off the wall thriller and bad according to jones he convinced jackson to have riley replace him in the production of dangerous some album sessions were put on hold due to jacksons health problems as he had spent time in a la hospital for weeks after complaining of chest pains when he was released he continued work on the album desiring to take his music to a harder sound than in previous albums inspired by his sister janets edgy sound in her album janet jacksons rhythm nation 1814 prior to working with riley jackson had desired to work with producers kenneth babyface edmonds and antonio la reid around the same time his brother jermaine jackson who had signed with la face records was set to work with them and since michael didnt tell jermaine about it before jermaine considered it as an act of betrayal though he later dismissed the notion jermaines song word to the badd was composed with lyrics aimed negatively at his brother and were later revised to lyrics aimed at a bad relationship songs that were recorded for the dangerous album but were eventually left out include monkey business she got it work that body serious effect which featured rapper ll cool j and if you dont love me some others were picked up during development of later albums or as bonus demos including the ballad for all time which was later released on thriller 25 slave to the rhythm which was later remastered and released for the 2014 posthumous album xscape the environmental anthem what about us which was dropped close to completion and later finished as earth song for history past present and future book i superfly sister and blood on the dance floor which would both later be issued on jacksons remix compilation blood on the dance floor history in the mix another song that didnt make dangerous was the riley produced joy the track would later be included on blackstreets 1994 selftitled debut where it was released as the third single89 composition and lyricsedit black or white the lead single from dangerous the danceable hard rock song black or white was one of jacksons most successful recordings101112 it contains many features of jacksons vocal style including the vocal hiccup he is known for with riley jackson recorded under the new jack swing genre a genre riley has been often credited with inventing it was also the first album in which jackson began rapping the inclusion of the rap group wreckxneffect jacksons embrace of hiphop rhythms and new jack swing were designed to give jackson a new younger urban audience in other recordings with bottrell jacksons sounds were more diverse as it had been in other albums with black or white recorded under the pop rock genre while the slashfeatured give in to me was recorded as a hard rock ballad the ballads keep the faith composed by jackson and his man in the mirror collaborators siedah garrett and glen ballard and the selfcomposed will you be there both featured strong elements of gospel music while the other ballads heal the world and gone too soon were softer pop ballads the smooth rb number remember the time featured elements of not only new jack swing but also funk while who is it and jam had stronger funk elements lyrics for the songs subject matter were more varied than in jacksons previous records though he often talked of the subject of racial harmony in some of his songs with his brothers the jacksons dangerous was the first of these albums in which he talked openly of racism which was the main topic with the hit song black or white other social commentary topics that jackson had never touched as a solo artist including poverty and inner city life were discussed in the song why you wanna trip on me in which he compared social ills to his own alleged publicized eccentricities that were covered in the press at the time asking critics and tabloid media why were they focusing on him when other more social problems were going on he addressed similar issues in the albums opening track jam which included rapping from heavy d in the closet had originally been set as a duet between jackson and madonna though this recording never happened and focused on two lovers carrying on a discreet affair without being open about the affair the album also included songs of other personal nature especially in songs such as she drives me wild remember the time cant let her get away who is it and give in to me the social commentary heal the world was in the middle of the number of personal songs gone too soon written by larry grossman and buz kohan was written and recorded for ryan white following whites death from aids in 1990 the title tracks lyrics were compared to that of dirty diana with the song focusing on a seductress releaseedit the album was released on november 26 1991 after its first week of release it debuted at numberone on the billboard 200 staying there for four weeks spanning two different calendar years sales of the album were shipped for seven million under two months making this the fastestselling album ever for jackson in the united states breaking the sales record he had held for bad which had shipped seven million in four months the album was certified seventimes platinum for sales of seven million copies alone in the united states according to the recording industry association of america riaa13 globally dangerous dominated worldwide charts debuting at numberone in the united kingdom while also reaching numberone in seven other territories including australia france germany the netherlands and spain it was also a huge success in asian countries sales of the album eventually reached over 32 million copies worldwide5614151617 promotionedit similar to how jacksons label had approached the bad album expectations again were raised high for the dangerous album in september 1991 jackson netted a deal to have his videos air on the fox tv network alongside regular musicvideo channels mtv bet and vh1 the elevenminute black or white video debuted on november 14 1991 and was seen in 27 countries and reportedly watched by a record 500 million viewers said to be the most to ever watch a music video18 the airing and later controversy of the video helped the sales of dangerous as did the broadcasting of two other jackson videos for remember the time and in the closet jacksons first hbo concert special michael jackson live in bucharest also helped in the sales of dangerous after it aired in october 1992 reviving sales of the album after several weeks of tapering off again jackson made personal appearances in early 1993 including the american music awards and grammy awards the latter in which he accepted the grammy legend award from his sister janet and the much talked about interview with oprah winfrey helping to return the album to the top ten singlesedit the albums leading track black or white was an instant numberone hit upon its release that november debuting at the top of the charts several weeks after it was released staying there for seven weeks it would be his only numberone single from the album on the pop charts jackson had four top ten singles in the united states from the album including remember the time which peaked at no 3 but reached numberone on the rb chart his first rb numberone since another part of me nearly four years earlier in the closet which peaked at no 6 on the hot 100 but also reached numberone the last top ten single for the album was will you be there which reached number seven and was boosted by an appearance on the free willy soundtrack helping to boost more sales from dangerous who is it peaked at number fourteen while jam and heal the world would both peak at the top thirty on the hot 100 respectively jacksons lowest pop showings since early 1979 and the overseasonly singles give in to me and gone too soon with give in to me reaching the top five in the uk netherlands australia and hitting the top of the charts in new zealand while gone too soon was more moderately received charting within the top forty the singles success of dangerous was more successful overseas than in jacksons native united states in the uk alone seven of the singles from the album all reached the uk top ten this was a record for any studio album in the uk until calvin harris broke this in 201319 critical receptionedit professional ratings review scores source rating allmusic 20 encyclopedia of popular music 21 entertainment weekly b−22 los angeles times 23 musichound rb 35524 pitchfork 861025 q 26 rolling stone 27 the village voice a−28 el país 45529 in a contemporary review for rolling stone alan light wrote that jackson was a man no longer a manchild confronting his wellpublicized demons and achieving transcendence through performance on an album that rose to the impossible challenge set by thriller during moments when rileys production dance rhythms prove a perfect match for jacksons clipped breathy uptempo voice30 robert christgau of the village voice deemed it jacksons most consistent album since off the wall a step up from bad even if its hookcraft is invariably secondary and its vocal mannerisms occasionally annoying while he felt jackson was too insistent with the faithhopeandcharity message songs christgau applauded the productions abrasively unpredictable rhythms and the sexandromance songs calling them the most plausible of jacksons career28 jon pareles was less receptive in the new york times calling it jacksons least confident solo album yet he believed the singer sounded anxious and out of place with rileys electronic beats while panning the dogmatically ordinary lyrics of the love songs writing that they seem based on demographic research rather than experience or imagination31 los angeles times critic chris willman found the record relatively tame and wildly unfocused being particularly critical of the songs not produced by riley such as the embarrassingly oversentimental heal the world of the overtly black first half of songs willman found the music innovative although lacking in substantial themes23 dangerous received four grammy nominations including three for jackson including best pop vocal performance for black or white as well as best rb vocal performance and best rb song for jam while teddy riley and bruce swedien won the grammy for best engineered album – non classical332 in a retrospective review for allmusic stephen thomas erlewine believed dangerous was a much sharper riskier album than bad33 culture critic joseph vogel was of the opinion that it fulfilled jacksons creative ambitions and was at once his most socially conscious record his most personally revealing and a dazzling musical odyssey comparing it to stevie wonders songs in the key of life as the work of an artist engaging with the world around himand inside himas never before34 writing for popmatters vogel argued that the rbnew jack swing albums music was more groundbreaking than any other pop record of the time if indeed it is considered a pop album dangerous redefined the parameters of pop how else to explain an album that mixes rb funk gospel hiphop rock industrial and classical an album that introduces one song will you be there with beethovens ninth symphony and another dangerous with what sounds like the heart of a steelcity factory an album that can alternately be paranoid cryptic sensual vulnerable idealistic bleak transcendent and fearful35 in 2007 the national association of recording merchandisers narm ranked dangerous at number 115 on its list of the definitive 200 albums of all time developed by the narm36 chuck eddy named it the eighth most essential new jack swing album in a list published by spin37
