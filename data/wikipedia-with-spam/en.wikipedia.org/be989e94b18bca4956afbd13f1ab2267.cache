exclusively on spiritual development without the possibility of becoming caught up in worldly affairs religious ideals of ‘bhiksha’ in hinduism ‘zakat’ in islam and ‘charity’ in christianity besides others promote almsgiving9 this obligation of making gifts to god by almsgiving explains the occurrence of generous donations outside religious sites like temples and mosques to mendicants begging in the name of god in buddhism monks and nuns traditionally live by begging for alms as did the historical gautama buddha himself this is among other reasons so that lay people can gain religious merit
