the federal republic of yugoslavia fry during the kosovo war the air strikes lasted from march 24 1999 to june 10 1999 the official nato operation code name was operation allied force the united states called it operation noble anvil17 while in yugoslavia the operation was incorrectly called merciful angel serbian cyrillic милосрдни анђео as a result of a misunderstanding or mistranslation18 the bombings continued until an agreement was reached that led to the withdrawal of yugoslav armed forces from kosovo and the establishment of united nations interim administration mission in kosovo unmik a un peacekeeping mission in kosovo nato claimed that the albanian population in kosovo were being persecuted by fry forces serbian police and serb paramilitary forces and that military action was needed to force the fry to stop nato countries attempted to gain authorisation from the united nations security council for military action but were opposed by china and russia that indicated they would veto such a proposal nato launched a campaign without un authorisation which it described as a humanitarian intervention the fry described the nato campaign as an illegal war of aggression against a sovereign country that was in violation of international law because it did not have un security council support the bombing killed between 489 and 528 civilians and destroyed bridges industrial plants public buildings private businesses as well as barracks and military installations the nato bombing marked the second major combat operation in its history following the 1995 nato bombing campaign in bosnia and herzegovina it was the first time that nato had used military force without the approval of the un security council19 contents 1 background 2 goals 3 strategy 31

autonomy was quashed kosovo was faced with state organized oppression from the early 1990s albanian language radio and television were restricted and newspapers shut down kosovar albanians were fired in large numbers from public enterprises and institutions including banks hospitals the post office and schools20 in june 1991 the university of priština assembly and several faculty councils were dissolved and replaced by serbs kosovar albanian teachers were prevented from entering school premises for the new school year beginning in september 1991 forcing students to study at home20 later kosovar albanians started an insurgency against belgrade when the kosovo liberation army was founded in 1996 armed clashes between the two sides broke out in early 1998 a natofacilitated ceasefire was signed on 15 october but both sides broke it two months later and fighting resumed when the killing of 45 kosovar albanians in the račak massacre was reported in january 1999 nato decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force to forcibly restrain the two sides after the rambouillet accords broke down on 23 march with yugoslav rejection of an external peacekeeping force nato prepared to install the peacekeepers by force goalsedit natos objectives in the kosovo conflict were stated at the north atlantic council meeting held at nato headquarters in brussels on april 12 199921 an end to all military action and the immediate termination of violence and repressive activities by the milosevic government withdrawal of all military police and paramilitary forces from kosovo stationing of un peacekeeping presence in kosovo unconditional and safe return of all refugees and displaced persons establishment of a political framework agreement for kosovo based on rambouillet accords in conformity with international law and the charter of the united nations strategyedit operation allied force predominantly used a largescale air campaign to destroy yugoslav military infrastructure from high altitudes after the third day of aerial bombing nato had destroyed almost all of its strategic military targets in yugoslavia despite this the yugoslav army continued to function and to attack kosovo liberation army kla insurgents inside kosovo mostly in the regions of northern and southwest kosovo nato bombed strategic economic and societal targets such as bridges military facilities official government facilities and factories using longrange cruise missiles to hit heavily defended targets such as strategic installations in belgrade and pristina the nato air forces also targeted infrastructure such as power plants using the blu114b softbomb waterprocessing plants and the stateowned broadcaster causing much environmental and economic damage throughout yugoslaviacitation needed commentatorswho have debated whether the capitulation of yugoslavia in the kosovo war of 1999 resulted solely from the use of air power or whether other factors contributedclarification neededcitation needed the rand corporation examined the issue in a study22clarification needed due to restrictive media laws media in yugoslavia carried little coverage of what its forces were doing in kosovo or of other countries attitudes to the humanitarian crisis so few members of the public expected bombing instead thinking that a diplomatic deal would be made23 arguments for strategic air poweredit according to john keegan the capitulation of yugoslavia in the kosovo war marked a turning point in the history of warfare it proved that a war can be won by air power alone by comparison diplomacy had failed before the war and the deployment of a large nato ground force was still weeks away when slobodan milošević agreed to a peace deal24 as for why air power should have been capable of acting alone it has been arguedby whom that there are several factors required these normally come together only rarely but all occurred during the kosovo war25 bombardment needs to be capable of causing destruction while minimising casualties this causes pressure within the population to end hostilities rather than to prolong them the exercise of precision air power in the kosovo war is saidby whom to have provided this the government must be susceptible to pressure from within the population as was demonstrated by the overthrow of milošević a year later serbias government was only weakly authoritarian and depended upon support from within the country there must be a disparity of military capabilities such that the opponent is unable to inhibit the exercise of air superiority over its territory serbia a relatively small impoverished balkan state faced a much more powerful nato coalition including the united kingdom and the united states carl von clausewitz once called the essential mass of the enemy his centre of gravity should the centre of gravity be destroyed a major factor in yugoslavian will to resist would be broken or removed in miloševićs case the centre of gravity was his hold on power he manipulated hyperinflation sanctions and restrictions in supply and demand to allow powerful business interests within serbia to profit and they responded by maintaining him in power the damage to the economy which squeezed it to a point where there was little profit to be made threatened to undermine their support for milošević if the air campaign continued whilst causing costly infrastructure damage26 arguments against strategic air poweredit diplomacy according to british lieutenantgeneral mike jackson russias decision on june 3 1999 to back the west and to urge milošević to surrender was the single event that had the greatest significance in ending the war the yugoslav capitulation came the same day27 russia relied on western economic aid at the time which made it vulnerable to pressure from nato to withdraw support for milošević28 milošević’s indictment by the un as a war criminal on may 24 1999 even if it did not influence him personally made the likelihood of russia resuming diplomatic support less likely29 the rambouillet agreement of march 18 1999 had yugoslavia agreed to it would have given nato forces the right of transit bivouac manoeuvre billet and utilisation across serbia by the time milošević capitulated nato forces were to have access only to kosovo proper30 the international civil presence in the province was to be under un control which allowed for a russian veto should serb interests be threatened30 concurrent ground operations – the kla undertook operations in kosovo itself and had some successes against serb forces the yugoslav army abandoned a border post opposite morinë near the yugoslav army outpost at kosare in the north west of the province the yugoslav army outpost at kosare remained in yugoslav hands throughout the war this allowed for a supply line to be set up into the province and the subsequent taking of territory in the junik area the kla also penetrated a few miles into the southwestern mount pastrik area but most of the province remained under serb control31 potential ground attack – general wesley clark supreme allied commander europe was convinced that planning and preparations for ground intervention in particular pushed milošević to concede32 the yugoslav capitulation occurred on the same day that us president bill clinton held a widely publicised meeting with his four service chiefs to discuss options for a groundforce deployment in case the air war failed33 however france and germany vigorously opposed a ground offensive and had done so for some weeks since april 1999 french estimates suggested that an invasion would need an army of 500000 to achieve success this left nato particularly the united states with a clear view that a land operation had no support with this in mind the americans reaffirmed their faith in the air campaign34 the reluctance of nato to use ground forces casts serious doubt on the idea that milošević capitulated out of fear of a land invasion35 operationedit on march 20 1999 osce kosovo verification mission monitors withdrew from kosovo citing a steady deterioration in the security situation3637 and on march 23 1999 richard holbrooke returned to brussels and announced that peace talks had failed38 hours before the announcement yugoslavia announced on national television it had declared a state of emergency citing an imminent threat of war against yugoslavia by nato and began a huge mobilisation of troops and resources3839 on march 23 1999 at

against yugoslavia although other nato members were involved during the ten weeks of the conflict nato aircraft flew over 38000 combat missions for the german air force this mission was its first conflict participation since world war ii in addition to air power one battalion of apache helicopters from the us armys 11th aviation regiment was deployed to help combat missions the regiment was augmented by pilots from fort braggs 82nd airborne attack helicopter battalion the battalion secured ah64 apache attack helicopter refueling sites and a small team forward deployed to the albania – kosovo border to identify targets for nato air strikes the campaign was initially designed to destroy yugoslavian air defences and highvalue military targetscitation needed ostruznica highway bridge hit during operation allied force nato military operations increasingly attacked yugoslavian units on the ground as well as continuing the strategic bombardment montenegro was bombed several times and nato refused to prop up the precarious position of its antimilošević leader milo đukanović dualuse targets used by civilians and military were attacked the targets included bridges across the danube factories power stations telecommunications facilities headquarters of yugoslavian leftists a political party led by miloševićs wife and the avala tv tower some protested that these actions were violations of international law and the geneva conventions nato argued these facilities were potentially useful to the yugoslavian military and that their bombing was justified on april 14 nato planes bombed ethnic albanians near koriša who had been used by yugoslav forces as human shields4344 yugoslav troops took tv crews to the scene shortly after the bombing45 the yugoslav government insisted that nato had targeted civilians464748 on may 7 nato bombed the chinese embassy in belgrade killing three chinese journalists nato had aimed at a yugoslav military target but navigational errors led to the wrong building being targeted49 the united states and nato apologised for the bombing saying it occurred because of an outdated map provided by the central intelligence agency the bombing strained relations between the peoples republic of china and nato provoking angry demonstrations outside western embassies in beijing50 nato command organisationedit solana directed clark to initiate air operations in the federal republic of yugoslavia clark then delegated responsibility for the conduct of operation allied force to the commanderinchief of allied forces southern europe who in turn delegated control to the commander of allied air forces southern europe lieutenantgeneral michael c short usaf51 operationally the daytoday for responsibility for executing missions was delegated to the commander of the 5th allied tactical air force52 yugoslav operationsedit the hague tribunal ruled that over 700000 kosovo albanians were forcibly displaced by yugoslav forces into neighbouring albania and macedonia with many thousands displaced within kosovo53 by april the united nations reported 850000 refugees had left kosovo54 another 230000 were listed as internally displaced persons idps driven from their homes but still inside kosovo german foreign minister joschka fischer claimed the refugee crisis was produced by a yugoslav plan codenamed operation horseshoe serbian television claimed that huge columns of refugees were fleeing kosovo because of nato’s bombing not yugoslav military operations5556 the yugoslav side and its western supporters claimed the refugee outflows were caused by a mass panic in the kosovo albanian population and the exodus was generated principally by fear of nato bombs the united nations and international human rights organisations were convinced the crisis resulted from a policy of ethnic cleansing many accounts from both serbs and albanians identified yugoslav security forces and paramilitaries as the culprits responsible for systematically emptying towns and villages of their albanian inhabitants by forcing them to flee57 atrocities against civilians in kosovo were the basis of united nations war crimes charges against milošević and other officials responsible for directing the kosovo conflict air combatedit canopy of f117 shot down by the yugoslav air force on march 27 1999 near the village of buđanovci serbia wreckage of downed yugoslav mig29 in ugljevik on march 25 1999 yugoslav antiaircraft fire at night an important portion of the war involved combat between the yugoslav air force and the opposing air forces united states air force f15s and f16s flying mainly from italian air force bases attacked the defending yugoslav fighters mainly mig29s which were in poor condition due to lack of spare parts and maintenance other nato forces also contributed to the air war air combat incidents during the night of march 2425 1999 yugoslav air force scrambled five mig29s to counter the initial attacks the two fighters that took off from niš airport were vectored to intercept targets over southern serbia and kosovo were dealt with by nato fighters the mig29 flown by maj dragan ilić was damaged he landed with one engine out and the aircraft was later expended as a decoy the second mig flown by maj ilijo arizanov was shot down by an usaf f15c piloted by lt col cesar rodriguez the pair from batajnica air base maj nebojša nikolić and maj ljubiša kulačin were engaged by usaf capt mike shower who shot down nikolić while kulačin evaded several missiles fired at him while fighting to bring his malfunctioning systems back to working order eventually realising that he could not do anything and with batajnica ab under attack he diverted to belgrade nikola tesla airport and landed safely his aircraft temporarily concealed under the tail of a parked retired airliner58 the fifth and last mig29 to get airborne that night was flown by maj predrag milutinović immediately after takeoff his radar failed and electrical generator malfunctioned shortly after he was warned by spo15 of being acquired by fire control radar but he eluded the opponent by several evasive manoeuvres attempting to evade further encounters he approached niš airport intending to land when he was hit by an 2k12 kub in a friendly fire incident and forced to eject in total the 127lae launched five mig29s on that night of which three were shot down one badly damaged and one returned in unserviceable condition not a single pilot was killed – even if it would take few days until one of them was recovered closer examination of available evidence indicates that maj arizanov was shot down by usaf col rodriguez while majors nikolic and kulacin were engaged by usaf capt showers who eventually shot down nikolic maj milutinovic’s aircraft was probably shot down by a klu f16am flown by maj peter tankink5960 while it remains unclear who damaged maj ilic’s mig29 it is possible that the 311 selfpropelled air defence missile regiment equipped with sa6s and deployed in the area where his aircraft was hit was responsiblecitation needed in the morning of march 25 maj slobodan tešanović stalled his mig29 while landing on ponikve airbase after a rebase flight he ejected safely6162 during the war yugoslav strike aircraft j22 oraos and g4 super galebs performed some 20–30 combat missions against the kla in kosovo at treetop level63 causing some casualties during one of those missions on march 25 1999 lt colonel života ðurić was killed when his j22 orao hit a hill in kosovo it was never firmly established whether an aircraft malfunction pilot error or an enemy action by kla was the cause nato never claimed it shot it down61 in the afternoon of march 25 1999 two yugoslav mig29s took off from batajnica to chase a lone nato aircraft flying in the direction of bosnia they crossed the border and were engaged by two us f15s both migs were shot down by captain jeff hwang64 one mig pilot major slobodan perić having evaded at least one missile before being hit ejected and was later smuggled back to yugoslavia by the republika srpska police the other pilot captain zoran radosavljević did not eject and was killed65

rescue forces near belgradecitation needed this was the first and so far only time a stealth aircraft has been shot downcitation needed on april 5 6 and 7 one yugoslav mig29 was scrambled to intercept nato aircraft but each time yugoslav pilots refused battle due to malfunctions62 on april 30 some american sources confirm that a second f117a was damaged by a surfacetoair missile68 although the aircraft returned to base it supposedly never flew again6970 on may 2 an american f16 was shot down near šabac by a sa3 again fired by the 3rd battalion of the 250th missile brigade the pilot was rescued on the same day an a10 thunderbolt ii was heavily damaged by strela 2 shouldermounted sam over kosovo and had to make an emergency landing in skopje71not in citation given also a usoperated

was shot down at a low altitude over his native city valjevo by two usaf f16s the falling aircraft was possibly hit as well by strela 2 fired by yugoslav troops pavlović was killed65 on may 11 an a10 was lightly damaged over kosovo71 during the war nato lost two ah64 apache strike helicopters one on april 26 and the other on may 473 in albania near the border with yugoslavia in training accidents resulting in death of two crew members nato reported that it lost 21 uavs to technical failures or enemy action during the conflict including at least seven german uavs and five french uavs while the commander of the yugoslav third army claimed that 21 nato uavs had been shot down by yugoslav forces another yugoslav general claimed that yugoslav air defences and ground forces had shot down 30 uavs74 kforedit by the start of april the conflict seemed closer to resolution nato countries began to deliberate about invading kosovo with ground units us president bill clinton was reluctant to commit us forces for a ground offensive at the same time finnish and russian negotiators continued to try to persuade milošević to back down faced with little alternative milošević accepted the conditions offered by a finnishrussian mediation team and agreed to a military presence within kosovo headed by the un but incorporating nato troops on june 12 after milošević accepted the conditions kfor began entering kosovo kfor a nato force had been preparing to conduct combat operations but in the end its mission was only peacekeeping it was based upon the allied rapid reaction corps headquarters commanded by then lieutenant general mike jackson of the british army it consisted of british forces a brigade built from 4th armored and 5th airborne brigades a french army brigade a german army brigade which entered from the west while all the other forces advanced from the south and italian army and us army brigades the us contribution known as the initial entry force was led by the us 1st armored division subordinate units included tf 1–35 armor from baumholder germany the 2nd battalion 505th parachute infantry regiment from fort bragg north carolina the 26th marine expeditionary unit from camp lejeune north carolina the 1st battalion 26th infantry regiment from schweinfurt germany and echo troop 4th cavalry regiment also from schweinfurt germany also attached to the us force was the greek armys 501st mechanised infantry battalion the initial us forces established their area of operation around the towns of uroševac the future camp bondsteel and gnjilane at camp monteith and spent four months – the start of a stay which continues to date – establishing order in the southeast sector of kosovo the first nato troops to enter pristina on june 12 1999 were norwegian special forces from fsk forsvarets spesialkommando and soldiers from the british special air service 22 sas although to natos diplomatic embarrassment russian troops arrived first at the airport the norwegian soldiers from fsk forsvarets spesialkommando were the first to come in contact with the russian troops at the airport fsks mission was to level the negotiating field between the belligerent parties and to finetune the detailed local deals needed to implement the peace deal between the serbians and the kosovo albanians75767778 during the initial incursion the us soldiers were greeted by albanians cheering and throwing flowers as us soldiers and kfor rolled through their villagescitation needed although no resistance was met three us soldiers from the initial entry force lost their lives in accidents79 following the military campaign the involvement of russian peacekeepers proved to be tense and challenging to the nato kosovo force the russians expected to have an independent sector of kosovo only to be unhappily surprised with the prospect of operating under nato command without prior communication or coordination with nato russian peacekeeping forces entered kosovo from bosnia and seized pristina international airport in 2010 james blunt in an interview described how his unit was given the assignment of securing the pristina in advance of the 30000strong peacekeeping force and the russian army had moved in and taken control of the airport before his units arrival as the first officer on the scene blunt shared a part in the difficult task of addressing the potentially violent international incident his own account tells of how he refused to follow orders from nato command to attack the russians80 outpost gunner was established on a high point in the preševo valley by echo battery 1161 field artillery in an attempt to monitor and assist with peacekeeping efforts in the russian sector operating under the support of 23 field artillery 1st armored division the battery was able to successfully deploy and continuously operate a firefinder radar which allowed the nato forces to keep a closer watch on activities in the sector and the preševo valley eventually a deal was struck whereby russian forces operated as a unit of kfor but not under the nato command structure81 nato forcesedit while not directly related to the hostilities on march 12 1999 the czech republic hungary and poland joined nato by depositing instruments of accession in accordance with article 10 of the north atlantic treaty at a ceremony in independence missouri82 these nations did not participate directly in hostilities aviationedit a large element of the operation was the air forces of nato relying heavily on the us air force and navy the french navy and air force operated the super etendard and the mirage 2000 the italian air force operated with 34 tornado 12 f104 12 amx 2 b707 the italian navy operated with harrier ii the british royal air force operated the harrier gr7 and tornado ground attack jets as well as an array of support aircraft belgian danish dutch norwegian and turkish air forces operated f16s the spanish air force deployed ef18s and kc130s the canadian air force deployed a total of 18 cf18s enabling them to be responsible for 10 of all bombs dropped in the operation the fighters were armed with both guided and unguided dumb munitions including the paveway series of laserguided bombscitation needed the bombing campaign marked the first time the german air force actively participated in combat operations since the end of world war ii83 however nato forces relied mostly upon the americans and the proven effectiveness of its air power by using the f16 f15 f117 f14 fa18 ea6b b52 kc135 kc10 awacs and jstars from bases throughout europe and from aircraft carriers in the region the american b2 spirit stealth bomber also saw its first successful combat role in operation allied force all while striking from its home base in the

military museum in belgrade us ground forces included a battalion from the 505th parachute infantry regiment 82nd airborne division the unit was deployed in march 1999 to albania in support of the bombing campaign where the battalion secured the tirana airfield apache helicopter refueling sites established a forwardoperating base to prepare for multiple launch rocket system mlrs strikes and offensive ground operations and deployed a small team with an antpq36 firefinder radar system to the albaniakosovo border where it acquired targets for alliednato air strikes immediately after the bombing campaign the battalion was refitted back at tirana airfield and issued orders to move into kosovo as the initial entry force in support of operation joint guardian task force hawk was also deployed aftermathedit civilian casualtiesedit main article civilian casualties during operation allied force sites in kosovo and southern central serbia where nato used munitions with depleted uranium human rights watch concluded that as few as 489 and as many as 528 yugoslav civilians were killed in the ninety separate incidents in operation allied force refugees were among the victims between 278 and 317 of the deaths nearly 60 percent of the total number were in kosovo in serbia 201 civilians were killed five in vojvodina and eight died in montenegro almost two thirds 303 to 352 of the total registered civilian deaths occurred in twelve incidents where ten or more civilian deaths were confirmed85 according to one serbian claim nato tactics sometimes included second post strikes in populated areas with the aim of destroying rescue and medical teams86 military casualtiesedit military casualties on the nato side were limited according to official reports the alliance suffered no fatalities from combat operations however on may 5 an american ah64 apache crashed and exploded during a nighttime mission in albania8788 the yugoslavs claimed they shot it down but nato claimed it crashed due to a technical malfunction it crashed 40 miles from tirana89 killing the two crewmen army chief warrant officers david gibbs and kevin reichert90 it was one of two apache helicopters lost in the war91 a further three american soldiers were taken as prisoners of war by yugoslav special forces while riding on a humvee on a surveillance mission along the macedonian border with kosovo92 a study of the campaign reports that yugoslav air defenses may have fired up to 700 missiles at nato aircraft and that the b1 bomber crews counted at least 20 surfacetoair missiles fired at them during their first 50 missions90 despite this only two nato aircraft one f16c939495 and one f117a nighthawk9697 were shot down98 a further f117a nighthawk was damaged6869 as were two a10

against other military vehicles and 857 against artillery and mortars110 after a total of 38000 sorties or 200 sorties per day at the beginning of the conflict and over 1000 at the end of the conflict111 when it came to alleged hits 93 tanks 153 apcs 339 other vehicles and 389 artillery systems were believed to have been disabled or destroyed with certainty112 the department of defense and joint chief of staff had earlier provided a figure of 120 tanks 220 apcs and 450 artillery systems and a newsweek piece published around a year later stated that only 14 tanks 18 apcs and 20 artillery systems had actually been obliterated112 not that far from the serbs’ own estimates of 13 tanks 6 apcs and 6 artillery pieces113 however this reporting was heavily criticised as it was based on the number of vehicles found during the assessment of the munitions effectiveness assessment team which wasn’t interested in the effectiveness of anything but the ordnance and surveyed sites that hadn’t been visited in nearly threemonths at a time when the most recent of strikes were fourweeks old113 the yugoslav air force also sustained serious damage with 121 aircraft destroyed114 operation allied force inflicted less damage on the yugoslav military than originally thought due to the use of camouflage other misdirection techniques were used to disguise military targets it was only in the later stages of the campaign that strategic targets such as bridges and buildings were attacked in any systematic way causing significant disruption and economic damage this stage of the campaign led to controversial incidents most notably the bombing of the peoples republic of china embassy in belgrade where three chinese reporters were killed and twenty injured which nato claimed was a mistake49 relatives of italian soldiers believe 50 of them have died since the war due to their exposure to depleted uranium weapons115 unep tests found no evidence of harm by depleted uranium weapons even among cleanup workers116 but those tests and unep’s report were questioned in an article in le monde diplomatique117 damage and economic lossedit eternal flame in belgrade memorial to the military and civilian victims of the nato bombing in april 1999 during the nato bombing officials in yugoslavia said the damage from the bombing campaign has cost around 100 billion up to that time118 in 2000 a year after the bombing ended group 17 published a survey dealing with damage and economic restoration the report concluded that direct damage from the bombing totalled 38 billion not including kosovo of which only 5 had been repaired at that time119 in 2006 a group of economists from the g17 plus party estimated the total economic losses resulting from the bombing were about 296 billion120 this figure included indirect economic damage loss of human capital and loss of gdpcitation needed political outcomeedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this

politically supervised by the united nations and that there would be no independence referendum for three years the yugoslav government agreed to withdraw its forces from kosovo under strong diplomatic pressure from russia and the bombing was suspended on june 10 the war ended june 11 and russian paratroopers seized slatina airport to become the first peacekeeping force in the war zone121 as british troops were still massed on the macedonian border planning to enter kosovo at 5 am the serbs were hailing the russian arrival as proof the war was a un operation not a nato operation after hostilities ended on june 12 the us armys 82nd airborne 2–505th parachute infantry regiment entered wartorn kosovo as part of operation joint guardian yugoslav president milošević survived the conflict and declared its outcome a major victory for yugoslavia he was however indicted for war crimes by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia along with a number of other senior yugoslav political and military figures his indictment led to yugoslavia as a whole being treated as a pariah by much of the international community because milošević was subject to arrest if he left yugoslavia the countrys economy was badly affected by the conflict and in addition to electoral fraud this was a factor in the overthrow of milošević thousands were killed during the conflict and hundreds of thousands more fled from the province to other parts of the country and to the surrounding countries most of the albanian refugees returned home within a few weeks or months however much of the nonalbanian population again fled to other parts of serbia or to protected enclaves within kosovo following the operation122123124125126 albanian guerrilla activity spread into other parts of serbia and to neighbouring republic of macedonia but subsided in 2001 the nonalbanian population has since diminished further following fresh outbreaks of intercommunal conflict and harassmentcitation needed in december 2002 elizabeth ii approved the awarding of the battle honour kosovo to squadrons of the raf that participated in the conflict these were nos 1 7 8 9 14 23 31 51

republic of kosovo government attitudes towards the campaignedit warning sign about nato cluster bombs near ski slopes at kopaonik main article legitimacy of the nato bombing of yugoslavia in favor of the campaignedit those who were involved in the nato airstrikes have stood by the decision to take such action us president bill clintons secretary of defense william cohen said the appalling accounts of mass killing in kosovo and the pictures of refugees fleeing serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide127 on cbs face the nation cohen claimed weve now seen about 100000 militaryaged men missing they may have been murdered128 clinton citing the same figure spoke of at least 100000 kosovar albanians missing129 later clinton said about yugoslav elections theyre going to have to come to grips with what mr milošević ordered in kosovo theyre going to have to decide whether they support his leadership or not whether they think its ok that all those tens of thousands of people were killed 130 in the same press conference clinton also claimed nato stopped deliberate systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide130 clinton compared the events of kosovo to the holocaust cnn reported accusing serbia of ethnic cleansing in kosovo similar to the genocide of jews in world war ii an impassioned clinton sought tuesday to rally public support for his decision to send us forces into combat against yugoslavia a prospect that seemed increasingly likely with the breakdown of a diplomatic peace effort131 president clintons state department also claimed serbian troops had committed genocide the new york times reported the administration said evidence of genocide by serbian forces was growing to include abhorrent and criminal action on a vast scale the language was the state departments strongest up to that time in denouncing yugoslav president slobodan milošević132 the state department also gave the highest estimate of dead albanians in may 1996 defense secretary william cohen suggested that there might be up to 100000 albanian fatalities133 five months after the conclusion of nato bombing when around one third of reported gravesites had been visited thus far 2108 bodies had been found with an estimated total of between 5000 and 12000 at that time134 serb forces had systematically concealed grave sites and moved bodies135136 the united states house of representatives passed a nonbinding resolution on march 11 1999 by a vote of 219–191 conditionally approving of president clintons plan to commit 4000 troops to the nato peacekeeping mission137 in late april the house appropriations committee approved 13 billion in emergency spending to cover the cost of the air war but a second nonbinding resolution approving of the mission failed in the full house by a vote of 213–213138 the senate had passed the second resolution in late march by a vote of 58–41139 criticism of the campaignedit there has also been criticism of the campaign joseph farah accused the coalition of exaggerating the casualty numbers to make a claim of potential genocide to justify the bombings140 the clinton administration was accused of inflating the number of kosovar albanians killed by serbians141 in an interview with radiotelevision serbia journalist danilo mandic on april 25 2006 noam chomsky claimed that strobe talbott the deputy secretary of state under president clinton and the leading us negotiator during the war had written in his foreword to john norris 2005 book collision course nato russia and kosovo that the real purpose of the war had nothing to do with concern for kosovar albanians but rather it was because serbia was not carrying out the required social and economic reforms meaning it was the last corner of europe which had not subordinated itself to the usrun neoliberal programs so therefore it had to be eliminated142 on may 31 2006 brad delong rebutted chomskys allegation and quoted from the elsewhere in the passage which chomsky had cited143 the kosovo crisis was fueled by frustration with milosevic and the legitimate fear that instability and conflict might spread further in the region and also that only a decade of death destruction and milosevic brinkmanship pushed nato to act when the rambouillet talks collapsed most of the leaders of natos major powers were proponents of third way politics and headed socially progressive economically centrist governments none of these men were particularly hawkish and milosevic did not allow them the political breathing room to look past his abuses143144 the united nations charter does not allow military interventions in other sovereign countries with few exceptions which in general need to be decided upon by the united nations security council the issue was brought before the unsc by russia in a draft resolution which interalia would affirm that such unilateral use of force constitutes a flagrant violation of the united nations charter china namibia and russia voted for the resolution the other members against thus it failed to pass145146dead link israeli minister of foreign affairs ariel sharon criticised the nato bombing of yugoslavia as an act of brutal interventionism147 sharon said both serbia and kosovo have been victims of violence he said prior to the current yugoslav campaign against kosovo albanians serbians were the targets of attacks in the kosovo province israel has a clear policy we are against aggressive actions we are against hurting innocent people i hope that the sides will return to the negotiating table as soon as possible during the crisis elyakim haetzni said the serbs should be the first to receive israeli aid there are our traditional friends he told israel radio148 it was suggested by david landau that israels proserbian position may have been a result of the serbian populations history of saving jews during the holocaust personal memories of which were still present among many older israeli politicians serving in government at the time such as tommy lapid149 those views contrasted sharply with much of the leadership of the american jewish committee which ran ads in favor the nato bombing campaign150 while ajc officials evoked comparisons to the holocaust151 israel subsequently provided medical assistance to 112 kosovar albanian refugees and housed them in israel having airlifted them on holocaust remembrance day with prime minister netanyahu stating events in the balkans although horrific do not compare to the tragedy of the holocaust in world war ii when 6 million jews were systematically killed by the nazis152153154 on april 29 1999 yugoslavia filed a complaint at the international court of justice icj at the hague against ten nato member countries belgium germany france united kingdom italy canada the netherlands portugal spain and the united states and alleged that the military operation had violated article 9 of the 1948 genocide convention and that yugoslavia had jurisdiction to sue through article 38 para 5 of rules of court155 on june 2 the icj ruled in an 8–4 vote that yugoslavia had no such jurisdiction156 four of the ten nations the united states france italy and germany had withdrawn entirely from the courts “optional clause” because yugoslavia filed its complaint only three days after accepting the terms of the courts optional clause the icj ruled that there was no jurisdiction to sue either britain or spain as the two nations had only agreed to submit to icj lawsuits if a suing party had filed their complaint a year or more after accepting the terms of the optional clause156 despite objections that yugoslavia had legal jurisdiction to sue belgium the netherlands canada and portugal156 the icj majority vote also determined that the nato bombing was an instance of “humanitarian intervention and thus did not violate article 9 of the genocide convention156 amnesty international released a report which stated that nato forces had deliberately targeted a civilian object nato bombing of the radio television of serbia headquarters and had bombed targets at which civilians were certain to be killed157158 the report was rejected by nato as baseless and illfounded a week before the report was released carla del ponte the chief prosecutor for the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia had told the united nations security council that her investigation into nato actions found no basis for charging nato or its leaders with war crimes159 a majority of us house republicans voted against two resolutions both of which expressed approval for american involvement in the nato mission160161 moscow criticised the bombing as a breach of international law and a
