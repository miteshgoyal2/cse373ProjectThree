distillery long operated by the bowman family the midtown reston condominiums a residential building at the reston town center reston was conceived as a planned community by robert e simon founded on april 10 1964 simons 50th birthday and named for his initials it was one of the first modern postwar planned communities in america which sparked a revival of the planned community concept7 simons family had recently sold carnegie hall and simon used the funds to create reston simon hired conklin rossant architects as master planners to incorporate higher density housing to conserve open space as well as mixed use areas for industry business recreation education and housing the first section of the community to be built lake anne plaza was designed by james rossant who studied under walter gropius at the harvard graduate school of design to emulate the italian coastal town of portofino lake anne village was designed with modern architectural themes that extend to a nearby elementary school a gasoline station and two churches lake anne also has an art gallery several restaurants the reston historic trust museum shops and a senior citizens fellowship house all are local businesses as there are no chain stores or chain restaurants allowed in lake anne close by are the cubist townhouses at hickory cluster that were designed by the noted modernist architect charles m goodman in the international style other sections of the town such as hunters woods south lakes and north point were developed later each with a neighborhood shopping center and supermarketcitation needed other backgroundedit the land on which reston sits was initially owned by lord fairfax during the 18th century ca wiehle for whom wiehle avenue is named bought the land later in the 1880s he died after construction of several buildings his sons did not share his vision and sold the land to a smith bowman who built a bourbon distillery on the site while maintaining a farm on most of the area a 7300acre 30 km2 tract an office retail development and a road are named for him in 1961 robert e simon bought most of the land except for 60 acres 240000 m2 on which the bowman distillery continued to operate until 19878910 developmentedit the growth and development of reston has been monitored by newspaper articles national magazines and scholarly journals on architecture and land use in 1967 the first lady of the united states mrs lyndon johnson visited reston to take a walking tour along its pathways as part of her interest in beautification projects apollo 11 astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin visited reston elementary schools named for them the washington post featured a road trip to reston in january 200611 and a relatively new website beyond dc has a page devoted to reston with almost 150 photos reston experienced increasing traffic congestion as it grew in the late 1970s and early 1980s this was a time when restons population was growing but the dulles toll road had not been built commuter traffic between reston and washington created serious traffic congestion on the roads that connected reston to washington dc in 1984 the toll road opened and in 1986 the west falls church washington metro station opened most recently the fairfax county parkway a major northsouth artery was opened12 reston has grown to a point where it now fits the definition of an edge city while reston takes on the statistical properties of an edge city its tightly controlled design averted several problems they typically face such as hostile pedestrian situations and lack of mass transit many of the neighborhoods in reston were designed to be medium density which is atypical of an edge city in other ways it is a textbook example with a majority of mediumrise office buildings and some citizens opposed to the expansion of its highdensity core13 ebola virus scareedit main article reston virus a filovirus at first suspected to be ebola virus ebov was discovered among crabeating macaques macaca fascicularis within the covance primate quarantine unit in 1989 this attracted significant media attention including the publication of the hot zone the filovirus was found to be distinct from ebov and to be nonpathogenic for humans it was named after the community and is now known as reston virus restv macaques found to be or suspected to be infected with restv were euthanized and the facility was sterilized14 the facility was located in an office park near sunset hills road and wiehle avenue it was eventually torn down and a daycare was built in its place zoningedit lake anne plaza in reston the careful planning and zoning within reston allows for common grounds several parks large swaths of wooded areas with picturesque runs streams wildflower meadows two golf courses nearly 20 public swimming pools bridle paths a bike path four lakes tennis courts and extensive foot pathways15 these pathways combined with bridges and tunnels help to separate pedestrians from vehicular traffic and increase safety at certain street crossings reston was built in wooded areas of oak maple sycamore and virginia pine reston is the location for a regional government center serving citizens in the northern part of fairfax county the reston regional library reston hospital center and the embry rucker community shelter are located nearby the reston police substation is also the office headquarters of the locally elected supervisor of the hunter mill district within the fairfax county board of supervisors reston is one of just a handful of communities in the us that has been designated a backyard wildlife habitat community usually this designation is for singlefamily homes reston serves as the headquarters for the north american command of the german armed forces and oversees upwards up 1500 troops deployed in the united states at any given time16 guiding principlesedit part of the new town movement from the beginning reston was designed to follow guiding principles in its development that would stress quality of life citizens would be able to live in the same community while going through different life cycles with different housing needs as they aged it was hoped that restonians could live work and have recreation in their own community with common grounds and scenic beauty shared equally regardless of income level4 beyond the influence of the new town movement reston was part of a backtotheland movement popular in the 1960s and early 1970s the principles incorporated in the community can be seen as a reaction to the new suburban communities of the postwar era eg levittown among the problems in these communities that reston responded to included income segregation a lack of natural preservation suburbs that served only as bedroom communities for commuters a lack of public space in new developments and a lack of community ties in new developments many early residents settled in reston because of the ideals of the community reston was planned with the following principles as stated by robert e simon in 1962 in the creation of reston virginia these are the major goals that the widest choice of opportunities be made available for the full use of leisure time this means that the new town should provide a wide range of cultural and recreational facilities as well as an environment for privacy that it be possible for anyone to remain in a single neighborhood throughout his life uprooting being neither inevitable nor always desirable by providing the fullest range of housing styles and prices – from highrise efficiencies to 6bedroom townhouses and detached houses – housing needs can be met at a variety of income levels and at different stages of family life this kind of mixture permits residents to remain rooted in the community if they so choose – as their particular housing needs change as a byproduct this also results in the heterogeneity that spells a lively and varied community that the importance and dignity of each individual be the focal point for all planning and take precedence for largescale concepts that the people be able to live and work in the same community that commercial cultural and recreational facilities be made available to the residents from the outset of the development – not years later that beauty – structural and natural – is a necessity of the good life and should be fostered since reston is being developed from private enterprise in order to be completed as conceived it must also of course be a financial success — the reston concept new town17 greenbelt maryland a 1930s community built as part of a federal new deal housing experiment is another example of a new town subsequent new town movement communities include roosevelt island in new york city and columbia maryland however reston was the first postwar community in the us to use clustered townhouse development18 a strategy that allows for the preservation of open space along with higher density reston was also the first 20thcentury private community in the us to incorporate natural preservation in its planning greenbelt was a publicly supported community11 buildings in reston town center usgs headquarters an important part of restons development is its five village centers and one town center each village center all of which save north point predate the reston town center was designed to be a halfmile walk from most homes and incorporate the daily retail and community service needs of residents denser developments such as apartments and clustered town homes are clustered around each village center the first village center built was the critically acclaimed lake anne see below followed by in chronological order hunters woods tall oaks south lakes and north point11 reston was planned before the term new urbanism entered into mainstream use but it follows new urbanism guidelines in a number of ways19 reston was built with an extensive path system and recently fairfax county has constructed many sidewalks20 it is possible to bike to downtown reston in 15 minutes from most locations the downtown and original areas also incorporate mixeduse development further mixeduse development is planned for areas where washington metro stations are or will be located21 however reston differs from new urbanism principles in several important ways almost all buildings are oriented away from main streets and few major arteries have complete sidewalk networks although pedestrian and bike travel is easily accomplished on the isolated nature paths referred to above this is a result of fairfax county controlling restons transportation planning—until recently the fairfax county zoning code only required sidewalks to be built by developers in certain cases the inward orientation of buildings was a preference of the early developers of reston who wished to avoid the commercial strip look that dominates many suburban developments in favor of a more naturalistic look11 in addition the dulles toll road corridor of office parks cuts a halfmile wide swath across the community with only five northsouth connections making crosstown travel by car and foot difficult the creation of a sixth connection at soapstone drive has been talked about in the past by planners and the creation of mixeduse developments around planned metro stations may help better knit the community together culture and activitiesedit a special tax district within fairfax county was created to fund the various educational cultural and recreational activities of the reston community center22 its main building is located on the southern side of reston at hunters woods plaza the center has a theater indoor heated swimming pool with jacuzzi ballroom meeting rooms
