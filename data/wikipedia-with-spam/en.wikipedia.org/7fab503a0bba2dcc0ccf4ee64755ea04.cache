barack obama presenting angelou with the presidential medal of freedom 2011 when i know why the caged bird sings was published in 1969 angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist one of the first africanamerican women who were able to publicly discuss their personal lives according to scholar hilton als up to that point black female writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters in the literature they wrote36 linguist john mcwhorter agreed seeing angelous works which he called tracts as apologetic writing he placed angelou in the tradition of africanamerican literature as a defense of black culture which he called a literary manifestation of the imperative that reigned in the black scholarship of the period133 writer julian mayfield who called caged bird a work of art that eludes description36 argued that angelous autobiographies set a precedent for not only other black women writers but also africanamerican autobiography as a whole als said that caged bird marked one of the first times that a black autobiographer could as he put it write about blackness from the inside without apology or defense36 through the writing of her autobiography angelou became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for blacks and women134 it made her without a doubt  americas most visible black woman autobiographer134 and a major autobiographical voice of the time135 as writer gary younge said probably more than almost any other writer alive angelous life literally is her work71 als said that caged bird helped increase black feminist writings in the 1970s less through its originality than its resonance in the prevailing zeitgeist36 or the time in which it was written at the end of the american civil rights movement als also claimed that angelous writings more interested in selfrevelation than in politics or feminism have freed other female writers to open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world36 angelou critic joanne m braxton stated that caged bird was perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing autobiography written by an africanamerican woman in its era134 angelous poetry has influenced the modern hiphop music community including artists such as kanye west common tupac shakur and nicki minaj136 critical reception reviewer elsie b washington most likely due to president clintons choice of angelou to recite her poem on the pulse of morning at his 1993 inauguration called her the black womans poet laureate137 sales of the paperback version of her books and poetry rose by 300–600 the week after angelous recitation random house which published the poem later that year had to reprint 400000 copies of all her books to keep up with the demand they sold more of her books in january 1993 than they did in all of 1992 accounting for a 1200 increase138 angelou famously said in response to criticism regarding using the details of her life in her work i agree with balzac and 19thcentury writers black and white who say i write for money71 younge speaking after the publication of angelous third book of essays letter to my daughter 2008 has said for the last couple of decades she has merged her various talents into a kind of performance art—issuing a message of personal and social uplift by blending poetry song and conversation104 angelous books

a glazier a professor at george washington university has trained teachers how to talk about race in their classrooms with i know why the caged bird sings and gather together in my name according to glazier angelous use of understatement selfmockery humor and irony have left readers of angelous autobiographies unsure of what she left out and how they should respond to the events she described angelous depictions of her experiences of racism have forced white readers to explore their feelings about race and their own privileged status glazier found that critics have focused on where angelou fits within the genre of africanamerican autobiography and on her literary techniques but readers have tended to react to her storytelling with surprise particularly when they enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography149 educator daniel challener in his 1997 book stories of resilience in childhood analyzed the events in caged bird to illustrate resiliency in children challener argued that angelous book has provided a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like maya have faced and how their communities have helped them succeed150 psychologist chris boyatzis has reported using caged bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of selfconcept and selfesteem ego resilience industry versus inferiority effects of abuse parenting styles sibling and friendship relations gender issues cognitive development puberty and identity formation in

seven autobiographies but she was also a prolific and successful poet she was called the black womans poet laureate and her poems have been called the anthems of african americans137 angelou studied and began writing poetry at a young age and used poetry and other great literature to cope with her rape as a young girl as described in caged bird18 according to scholar yasmin y degout literature also affected angelous sensibilities as the poet and writer she became especially the liberating discourse that would evolve in her own poetic canon152 many critics consider angelous autobiographies more important than her poetry153 although all her books have been bestsellers her poetry has not been perceived to be as serious as her prose and has been understudied5 her poems were more interesting when she recited and performed them and many critics emphasized the public aspect of her poetry154 angelous lack of critical acclaim has been attributed to both the public nature of many of her poems and to angelous popular success and to critics preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal performed one155 zofia burr has countered angelous critics by condemning them for not taking into account angelous larger purposes in her writing to be representative rather than individual authoritative rather than confessional156 style and genre in autobiographies main article themes in maya angelous autobiographies angelous use of fictionwriting techniques such as dialogue characterization and development of theme setting plot and language has often resulted in the placement of her books into the genre of autobiographical fiction157 angelou made a deliberate attempt in her books to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing changing and expanding the genre158 scholar mary jane lupton argues that all of angelous autobiographies conform to the genres standard structure they are written by a single author they are chronological and they contain elements of character technique and theme159 angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to her books lupton agrees stating that angelou tended to diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth160 which parallels the conventions of much of africanamerican autobiography written during the abolitionist period of us history when as both lupton and africanamerican scholar crispin sartwell put it the truth was censored out of the need for selfprotection160161 scholar lyman b hagen places angelou in the long tradition of africanamerican autobiography but claims that angelou created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form162 angelou at york college in february 2013 according to africanamerican literature scholar pierre a walker the challenge for much of the history of africanamerican literature was that its authors have had to confirm its status as literature before they could accomplish their political goals which was why angelous editor robert loomis was able to dare her into writing caged bird by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered high art163 angelou acknowledged that she followed the slave narrative tradition of speaking in the firstperson singular talking about the firstperson plural always saying i meaning we127 scholar john mcwhorter calls angelous books tracts133 that defend africanamerican culture and fight negative stereotypes according to mcwhorter angelou structured her books which to him seem to be written more for children than for adults to support her defense of black culture mcwhorter sees angelou as she depicts herself in her autobiographies as a kind of standin figure for the black american in troubled times133 mcwhorter views angelous works as dated but recognizes that she has helped to pave the way for contemporary black writers who are able to enjoy the luxury of being merely individuals no longer representatives of the race only themselves164 scholar lynn z bloom compares angelous works to the writings of frederick douglass stating that both fulfilled the same purpose to describe black culture and to interpret it for their wider white audiences165 according to scholar sondra oneale angelous poetry can be placed within the africanamerican oral tradition and her prose follows classic technique in nonpoetic western forms166 oneale states that angelou avoided using a monolithic black language167 and accomplished through direct dialogue what oneale calls a more expected ghetto expressiveness167 mcwhorter finds both the language angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic resulting in a separation between her and her audience as mcwhorter states i have never read autobiographical writing where i had such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks or a sense of who the subject really is168 mcwhorter asserts for example that key figures in angelous books like herself her son guy and mother vivian do not speak as one would expect and that their speech is cleaned up for her readers169 guy for example represents the young black male while vivian represents the idealized mother figure and the stiff language they use as well as the language in angelous text is intended to prove that blacks can use standard english competently170 mcwhorter recognizes that much of the reason for angelous style was the apologetic nature of her writing133 when angelou wrote caged bird at the end of the 1960s one of the necessary and accepted features of literature at the time was organic unity and one of her goals was to create a book that satisfied that criterion163 the events in her books were episodic and crafted like a series of short stories but their arrangements did not follow a strict chronology instead they were placed to emphasize the themes of her books which include racism identity family and travel english literature scholar valerie sayers has asserted that angelous poetry and prose are similar they both rely on her direct voice which alternates steady rhythms with syncopated patterns and uses similes and metaphors eg the caged bird171 according to hagen angelous works were influenced by both conventional literary and the oral traditions of the africanamerican community for example she referenced over 100 literary characters throughout her books and poetry172 in addition she used the elements of blues music including the act of testimony when speaking of ones life and struggles ironic understatement and the use of natural metaphors rhythms and intonations173 angelou instead of depending upon plot used personal and historical events to shape her books174 references explanatory notes angelou wrote about vivian baxters life and their relationship in mom me mom 2013 her final installment in her series of seven autobiographies according to angelou annie henderson built her business with food stalls catering to black workers which eventually developed into a store9 the correct greek spelling of angelous husband name is probably anastasios angelopoulos26 reviewer john m miller calls angelous performance of her song all that happens in the marketplace the most genuine musical moment in the film32 in angelous third book of essays letter to my daughter 2009 she credits cuban artist celia cruz as one of the greatest influences of her singing career and later
