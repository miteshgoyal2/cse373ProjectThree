former headquarters plate from when nintendo was solely a playing card company nintendo was founded as a card company by fusajiro yamauchi on september 23 18898 based in kyoto the business produced and marketed a playing card game called hanafuda the handmade cards soon became popular and yamauchi hired assistants to massproduce cards to satisfy demand9 in 1949 the company adopted the name nintendo karuta co ltdb doing business as the nintendo playing card co outside japan nintendo continues to manufacture playing cards in japan10 and organizes its own contract bridge tournament called the nintendo cup11 the word nintendo can be translated as leave luck to heaven or alternatively as the temple of free hanafuda1213 1956–1974 new ventures in 1956 hiroshi yamauchi grandson of fusajiro yamauchi visited the us to talk with the united states playing card company the dominant playing card manufacturer there he found that the biggest playing card company in the world was using only a small office yamauchis realization that the playing card business had limited potential was a turning point he then acquired the license to use disney characters on playing cards to drive sales in 1963 yamauchi renamed nintendo playing card co ltd to nintendo co ltd14 the company then began to experiment in other areas of business using newly injected capital during the period of time between 1963 and 1968 nintendo set up a taxi company called daiya this business was initially successful however nintendo was forced to sell it because problems with the labour unions were making it too expensive to run the service it also set up a love hotel chain a tv network a food company selling instant rice and several other ventures15 all of these ventures eventually failed and after the 1964 tokyo olympics playing card sales dropped and nintendos stock price plummeted to its lowest recorded level of ¥601617 in 1966 nintendo moved into the japanese toy industry with the ultra hand an extendable arm developed by its maintenance engineer gunpei yokoi in his free time yokoi was moved from maintenance to the new nintendo games department as a product developer nintendo continued to produce popular toys including the ultra machine love tester and the kousenjuu series of light gun gamescitation needed despite some successful products nintendo struggled to meet the fast development and manufacturing turnaround required in the toy market and fell behind the wellestablished companies such as bandai and tomy9 in 1973 its focus shifted to family entertainment venues with the laser clay shooting system using the same light gun technology used in nintendos kousenjuu series of toys and set up in abandoned bowling alleys following some success nintendo developed several more light gun machines such as the light gun shooter game wild gunman for the emerging arcade scene while the laser clay shooting system ranges had to be shut down following excessive costs nintendo had found a new market 1974–1978 early electronic era nintendos first venture into the video gaming industry was securing rights to distribute the magnavox odyssey video game console in japan in 1974 nintendo began to produce its own hardware in 1977 with the color tvgame home video game consoles four versions of these consoles were produced each including variations of a single game for example color tv game 6 featured six versions of light tennis a student product developer named shigeru miyamoto was hired by nintendo at this time18 he worked for yokoi and one of his first tasks was to design the casing for several of the color tvgame consoles miyamoto went on to create direct and produce some of nintendos most famous video games and become one of the most recognizable figures in the video game industry18 in 1975 nintendo moved into the video arcade game industry with evr race designed by their first game designer genyo takeda19 and several more titles followed nintendo had some small success with this venture but the release of donkey kong in 1981 designed by miyamoto changed nintendos fortunes dramatically the success of the game and many licensing opportunities such as ports on the atari 2600 intellivision and colecovision gave nintendo a huge boost in profit and in addition the game also introduced an early iteration of mario then known in japan as jumpman the eventual company mascot 1979–2003 success with video games main articles game watch nes game boy snes nintendo 64 and game boy advance sp the game watch series was nintendos first worldwide success in video

which gave birth to game watch20 in 1980 nintendo launched game watch—a handheld video game series developed by yokoi these systems do not contain interchangeable cartridges and thus the hardware was tied to the game the first game watch game released titled ball was distributed worldwide the modern cross dpad design was developed in 1982 by yokoi for a donkey kong version proven to be popular the design was patented by nintendo it later earned a technology engineering emmy award2122 in 1983 nintendo launched the family computer colloquialized as famicom home video game console in japan alongside ports of its most popular arcade titles in 1985 a cosmetically reworked version of the system known outside japan as the nintendo entertainment system or nes launched in north america the practice of bundling the system along with select games helped to make super mario bros one of the bestselling video games in history23 in 1988 gunpei yokoi and his team at nintendo rd1 conceived the new game boy handheld system with the purpose of merging the two very successful ideas of the game watchs portability along with the ness cartridge interchangeability nintendo released the game boy in japan on 21 april 1989 and in north america on 31 july 1989 nintendo of america president minoru arakawa managed a deal to bundle the popular third party game tetris along with the game boy and the

main headquarters in kyoto japan nintendo of america headquarters in redmond washington nintendo of europe headquarters in frankfurt germany nintendos tokyo office nintendo co ltd headquartered in

yen and nintendo manufactures and distributes official nintendo consoles and games for the mainland chinese market under the ique brand the product lineup for the chinese market is considerably different from that for other markets for example nintendos only console in china is the ique player a modified version of the nintendo 64 the company has not released its more modern gamecube or wii to the market although a version of the nintendo 3ds xl was released in 2012 as of 2013 it is a 100 nintendoowned subsidiary119120 nintendo of korea nintendos south korean subsidiary was established on 7 july 2006121 in march 2016 the subsidiary was heavily downsized due to a corporate restructuring decision after analyzing shifts in the current market laying off 80 of its employees leaving only ten people at its helm including ceo hiroyuki fukuda however this did not affect any game titles being scheduled for release in south korea at the time and nintendo continued operations there as usual122123 subsidiaries although most of the research development is being done in japan there are some rd facilities in the united states and europe that are focused on developing software and hardware technologies used in nintendo products although they all are subsidiaries of nintendo and therefore first party they are often referred to as external resources when being involved in joint development processes with nintendos internal developers by the japanese personal involved this can be seen in a variety of iwata asks interviews124 nintendo software technology nst and nintendo technology development ntd are located in redmond washington united states while nintendo european research development nerd is located in paris france and nintendo network service database nsd is located in kyoto japan most external firstparty software development is done in japan since the only overseas subsidiary is retro studios in the united states although these studios are all subsidiaries of nintendo they are often referred to as external resources when being involved in joint development processes with nintendos internal developers by the nintendo entertainment planning development epd division 1up studio and nd cube are located in tokyo japan while monolith soft has one studio located in tokyo and another in kyoto retro studios is located in austin texas logos

guidelines for video games published on its consoles although nintendo allowed graphic violence in its video games released in japan nudity and sexuality were strictly prohibited former nintendo president hiroshi yamauchi believed that if the company allowed the licensing of pornographic games the companys image would be forever tarnished125 nintendo of america went further in that games released for nintendo consoles could not feature nudity sexuality profanity including racism sexism or slurs blood graphic or domestic violence drugs political messages or religious symbols with the exception of widely unpracticed religions such as the greek pantheon126 the japanese parent company was concerned that it may be viewed as a japanese invasion by forcing japanese community standards on north american and european children despite the strict guidelines some exceptions have occurred bionic commando though swastikas were eliminated in the us version smash tv and golgo 13 top secret episode contained human violence the latter also containing implied sexuality and tobacco use river city ransom and taboo the sixth sense contained nudity and the latter also contained religious images as did castlevania ii and iii a known side effect of this policy was the genesis version of mortal kombat selling over double the number of the super nes version mainly because nintendo had forced publisher acclaim to recolor the red blood to look like white sweat and replace some of the more gory graphics in its release of the game making it less violent127 by contrast sega allowed blood and gore to remain in the genesis version though a code was required to unlock the gore nintendo allowed the super nes version of mortal kombat ii to ship uncensored the following year with a content warning on the packaging128 in 1994 and 2003 when the esrb and pegi respectively video game ratings systems were introduced nintendo chose to abolish most of these policies in favor of consumers making their own choices about the content of the games they played today changes to the content of games are done primarily by the games developer or occasionally at the request of nintendo the only clearset rule is that esrb aorated games will not be licensed on nintendo consoles in north america129 a practice which is also enforced by sony and microsoft its two greatest competitors in the present market nintendo has since allowed several maturecontent games to be published on its consoles including perfect dark conkers bad fur day doom and doom 64 bmx xxx the resident evil series killer7 the mortal kombat series eternal darkness sanitys requiem bloodrayne geist dementium the ward bayonetta 2 devils third and fatal frame maiden of black water certain games have continued to be modified however for example konami was forced to remove all references to cigarettes in the 2000 game boy color game metal gear solid although the previous nes version of metal gear and the subsequent gamecube game metal gear solid the twin snakes both included such references as did wii title madworld and maiming and blood were removed from the nintendo 64 port of cruisn usa130 another example is in the game boy advance game mega man zero 3 in which one of the bosses called hellbat schilt in the japanese and european releases was renamed devilbat schilt in the north american localization in north america releases of the mega man zero games enemies and bosses killed with a saber attack would not gush blood as they did in the japanese versions however the release of the wii was accompanied by a number of even more controversial titles such as manhunt 2 no more heroes the house of the dead overkill and madworld the latter three of which were published exclusively for the console license guidelines nintendo of america also had guidelines before 1993 that had to be followed by its licensees to make games for the nintendo entertainment system in addition to the above content guidelines125 guidelines were enforced through the 10nes lockout chip licensees were not permitted to release the same game for a competing console until two years had passed nintendo would decide how many cartridges would be supplied to the licensee nintendo would decide how much space would be dedicated for articles advertising etc in the nintendo power magazine there was a minimum number of cartridges that had to be ordered by the licensee from nintendo there was a yearly limit of five games that a licensee may produce for a nintendo console131 this rule was created to prevent market oversaturation which had contributed to the north american video game crash of 1983 the last rule was circumvented in a number of ways for example konami wanting to produce more games for nintendos consoles formed ultra games and later palcom to produce more games as a technically different publisher125 this disadvantaged smaller or emerging companies as they could not afford to start additional companies in another side effect square co now square enix executives have suggested that the price of publishing games on the nintendo 64 along with the degree of censorship and control that nintendo enforced over its games most notably final fantasy vi were factors in switching its focus towards sonys playstation consolecitation needed in 1993 a class action suit was taken against nintendo under allegations that their lockout chip enabled unfair business practices the case was settled with the condition that california consumers were entitled to a 3 discount coupon for a game of nintendos choice132 emulation this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it october 2014 nintendo is opposed to any thirdparty emulation of its video games and consoles stating that it is the single largest threat to the intellectual property rights of video game developers133 however emulators have been used by nintendo and licensed third party companies as a means to rerelease older games through the virtual console seal of quality nintendo seal of quality seal in ntsc regions seal of quality in pal regions the gold sunburst seal was first used by nintendo of america and later nintendo of europe it is displayed on any game system or accessory licensed for use on one of its video game consoles denoting the game has been properly approved by nintendo the seal is also displayed on any nintendolicensed merchandise such as trading cards game guides or apparel albeit with the words official nintendo licensed product134 in 2008 game designer sid meier cited the seal of quality as one of the three most important innovations in video game history as it helped set a standard for game quality that protected consumers from shovelware135 ntsc regions in ntsc regions this seal is an elliptical starburst titled official nintendo seal originally for ntsc countries the seal was a large black and gold circular starburst the seal read as follows this seal is your assurance that nintendo has approved and guaranteed the quality of this product this seal was later altered in 1988 approved and guaranteed was changed to evaluated and approved in 1989 the seal became gold and white as it currently appears with a shortened phrase official nintendo seal of quality it was changed in 2003 to read official nintendo seal134 the seal currently reads136 the official seal is your assurance that this product is licensed or manufactured by nintendo always look for this seal when buying video game systems accessories games and related products pal regions in pal regions the seal is a circular starburst titled original nintendo seal of quality text near the seal in the australian wii manual states this seal is your assurance that nintendo has reviewed this product and that it has met our standards for excellence in workmanship reliability and entertainment value always look for this seal when buying games and accessories to ensure complete compatibility with your nintendo product137 charitable projects since 1992 nintendo has teamed with the starlight childrens foundation to build starlight fun center mobile entertainment units and install them in hospitals138 1000 starlight nintendo fun center units were installed by the end of 1995138 these units combine several forms of multimedia entertainment including gaming and serve as a distraction to brighten moods and boost kids morale during hospital stays139 environmental record nintendo has consistently been ranked last in greenpeaces guide to greener electronics due to nintendos failure to publish information140 similarly they are ranked last in the enough projects conflict minerals company rankings due to nintendos refusal to respond to multiple requests for information141 like many other electronics companies nintendo offers a takeback recycling program which allows customers to mail in old products they no longer use nintendo of america claimed that it took in 548 tons of returned products in 2011 98 of which was either reused or recycled142 trademark during the peak of nintendos success in the video game industry in the 1990s their name was ubiquitously used to refer to any video game console regardless of the manufacturer to prevent their trademark from becoming generic nintendo pushed usage of the term game console and succeeded in preserving their trademark143144 see
