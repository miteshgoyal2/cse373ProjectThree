the market for more than 40 years the magazine sold more than 135 million copies a week at one point it was so popular that president harry s truman sir winston churchill and general douglas macarthur

between john ames mitchell and andrew miller mitchell held a 75 per cent interest in the magazine with the remainder by miller both men retained their holdings until their deaths4 miller served as secretarytreasurer of the magazine and was very successful managing the business side of the operation mitchell a 37yearold illustrator who used a 10000 inheritance to invest in the weekly magazine served as its publisher mitchell created the first life nameplate with cupids as mascots he later drew its masthead of a knight leveling his lance at the posterior of a fleeing devil mitchell took advantage of a revolutionary new printing process using zinccoated plates which improved the reproduction of his illustrations and artwork this edge helped because life faced stiff competition from the bestselling humor magazines judge and puck which were already established and successful edward sandford martin was brought on as lifes first literary editor the recent harvard university graduate was a founder of the harvard lampoon the motto of the first issue of life was while theres life theres hope5 the new magazine set forth its principles and policies to its readers we wish to have some fun in this paper we shall try to domesticate as much as possible of the casual cheerfulness that is drifting about in an unfriendly world we shall have something to say about religion about politics fashion society literature the stage the stock exchange and the police station and we will speak out what is in our mind as fairly as truthfully and as decently as we know how5 the magazine was a success and soon attracted the industrys leading contributors6 among the most important was charles dana gibson three years after the magazine was founded the massachusetts native first sold life a drawing for 4 a dog outside his kennel howling at the moon encouraged by a publisher who was also an artist gibson was joined in life early days by such wellknown illustrators as palmer cox creator of

for chicagos grisly iroquois theater fire in 1903 a national uproar ensued lifes drama critic james stetson metcalfe was barred from the 47 manhattan theatres controlled by the theatrical syndicate life published caricatured cartoons of jews with enormous noses life became a place that discovered new talent this was particularly true among illustrators in 1908 robert ripley published his first cartoon in life 20 years before his believe it or not fame norman rockwells first cover for life taint you was published may 10 1917 rockwells paintings were featured on lifes cover 28 times between 1917 and 1924 rea irvin the first art director of the new yorker and creator of the character eustace tilley got his start drawing covers for life charles dana gibson dreamed up the magazines most celebrated figure in its early decades his creation the gibson girl was a tall regal beauty after appearances in life in the 1890s the image of the elegant gibson girl became the nations feminine ideal the gibson girl was a publishing sensation and earned a place in fashion history this version of life took sides in politics and international affairs and published fiery proamerican editorials mitchell and gibson were incensed when germany attacked belgium in 1914 they undertook a campaign to push the united states into the war mitchells seven years studying at paris art schools made him partial to the french there was no unbiased coverage of the war gibson drew the kaiser as a bloody madman insulting uncle sam sneering at crippled soldiers and shooting red cross nurses mitchell lived just long enough to see lifes crusade result in the us declaration of war in 1917 following mitchells death in 1918 gibson bought the magazine for 1 million but the world had changed it was not the gay nineties when familystyle humor prevailed and the chaste gibson girls wore floorlength dresses world war i had spurred changing tastes among the magazinereading public lifes brand of fun clean and cultivated humor began to pale before the new variety crude sexy and cynical life struggled to compete on newsstands with such risqué rivals a little more than three years after purchasing life gibson quit and turned the decaying property over to publisher clair maxwell and treasurer henry richter gibson retired to maine to paint and lost active interest in the magazine which he left deeply in the red 1922 cover the flapper by f x leyendecker in 1920 gibson selected former vanity fair staffer robert e sherwood as editor a world war i veteran and member of the algonquin round table sherwood

ellison hoover h t webster art young and john held jr life had 250000 readers in 1920citation needed but as the jazz age rolled into the great depression the magazine lost money and subscribers by the time maxwell and editor george eggleston took over life had switched from publishing weekly to monthly the two men went to work revamping its editorial style to meet the times and in the process it did win new readers despite allstar talents on staff life had passed its prime and was sliding toward financial ruin the new yorker debuting in february 1925 copied many of the features and styles of life it recruited staff from its editorial and art departments another blow to lifes circulation came from raunchy humor periodicals such as ballyhoo and hooey which ran what can be termed outhouse gags in 1933 esquire joined lifes competitors life struggled to make a profit in the 1930s when henry luce purchased it luce kept the name for his new plans and sold the contents and subscription list to judge7 announcing the death of life maxwell declared we cannot claim like mr gene tunney that we resigned our championship undefeated in our prime but at least we hope to retire gracefully from a world still friendlycitation needed for lifes final issue in its original format 80yearold edward sandford martin was recalled from editorial retirement to compose its obituary he wrote that life should be passing into the hands of new owners and directors is of the liveliest interest to the sole survivor of the little group that saw it born in january 1883 as for me i wish it all good fortune

images as to words the first issue of life which sold for ten cents worth 173 today featured five pages of alfred eisenstaedts photographs in planning the weekly news magazine luce circulated a confidential prospectus within time inc in 1936 which described his vision for the new life magazine and what he viewed as its unique purpose life magazine was to be the first publication with a focus on photographs that enabled the american public to see life to see the world to eyewitness great events to watch the faces of the poor and the gestures of the proud to see strange things — machines armies multitudes shadows in the jungle and on the moon to see man’s work — his paintings towers and discoveries to see things thousands of miles away things hidden behind walls and within rooms things dangerous to come to the women that men love and many children to see and take pleasure in seeing to see and be amazed to see and be instructed8 when the first issue of life magazine appeared

peck dam in montana a works progress administration project photographed by margaret bourkewhite 19 west 31st street the format of life in 1936 was an instant classic the text was condensed into captions for 50 pages of photographs the magazine was printed on heavily coated paper and cost readers only a dime the magazines circulation skyrocketed beyond the companys predictions going from 380000 copies of the first issue to more than one million a week four months later10 the magazines success stimulated many imitators such as look which was founded a year later in 1937 and ran until 1971 luce moved life into its own building at 19 west 31st street a beauxarts architecture jewel built in 1894 it is considered a building of outstanding significance by the new york landmarks preservation commission later life moved its editorial offices to 9 rockefeller plaza successedit luce selected edward kramer thompson a stringer for time as assistant picture editor in 1937 from 1949 to 1961 he was the managing editor and served as editorinchief for nearly a decade until his retirement in 1970 his influence was significant during the magazines heyday which was roughly from 1936 until the mid1960s thompson was known for the free rein he gave his editors particularly a trio of formidable and colorful women sally kirkland fashion editor mary letherbee movie editor and mary hamman modern living editor11 in august 1942 writing about labor and racial unrest in detroit life warned that the morale situation is perhaps the worst in the us it is time for the rest of the country to sit up and take notice for detroit can either blow up hitler or it can blow up the us12 mayor edward jeffries was outraged ill match detroits patriotism against any other citys in the country the whole story in life is scurrilous id just call it a yellow magazine and let it go at that13 the article was considered so dangerous to the war effort that it was censored from copies of the magazine sold outside north america14 when the us entered the war in 1941 so did life by 1944 of the 40 time and life war correspondents seven were women americans mary welsh hemingway margaret

drew more than 1500 entries submitted by all ranks judges sorted out the best and awarded 1000 in prizes life picked 16 for reproduction in the magazine the national gallery in washington dc agreed to put 117 entries on exhibition that summer life in its patriotism also supported the militarys efforts to use artists to document the war when congress forbade the armed forces from using government money to fund artists in the field life privatized the programs hiring many of the artists being let go by the department of defense dod on december 7 1960 life managers later donated many of the works by such artists to the dod and its art programs such as the united states army art program16 cover of the september 13 1948 issue of life with marshal josip broz tito the magazine hired robert capa the distinguished war photographer a veteran of colliers magazine capa accompanied the first wave of the dday invasion in normandy france on june 6 1944 a mishap at the life photography darkroom ruined dozens of capas photos which he had taken during the beach landing the magazine wrote in the captions that the photos were fuzzy because capas hands were shaking he denied it and later poked fun at life by titling his war memoir slightly out of focus 1947 in 1954 capa was killed after stepping on a landmine while working for the magazine covering the first indochina war life photographer bob landry also went in with the first wave at dday but all of landrys film was lost and his shoes to boot17 each week during world war ii the magazine brought the war home to americans it had photographers in all theaters of war from the pacific to europe the magazine was imitated in enemy propaganda using contrasting images of life and death18 in a notable mistake in its final edition just before the 1948 us presidential election the magazine printed a large photo showing us presidential candidate thomas e dewey and his staff riding across san francisco california harbor entitled our next president rides by ferryboat over san francisco bay incumbent president harry s truman won the election19 on may 10 1950 the council of ministers in cairo banned life from egypt forever all issues on sale were confiscated no reason was given but egyptian officials expressed indignation over the april 10 1950 story about king farouk of egypt entitled the problem king of egypt the government considered it insulting to the country20 life in the 1950s earned a measure of respect by commissioning work from top authors after lifes publication in 1952 of ernest hemingways the old man and the sea the magazine contracted with the author for a 4000word piece on bullfighting hemingway sent the editors a 10000word article following his last visit to spain in 1959 to cover a series of contests between two top matadors the article was republished in 1985 as the novella the dangerous summer21 in february 1953 just a few weeks after leaving office president harry s truman announced that life magazine would handle all rights to his memoirs truman said it was his belief that by 1954 he would be able to speak more fully on subjects pertaining to the role his administration played in world affairs truman observed that life editors had presented other memoirs with great dignity he added that life also made the best offer in november 1954 the actress dorothy dandridge was the first africanamerican woman to be featured on the cover of the magazine in 1957 r gordon wasson a vice president at jpmorgan published an article in life extolling the virtues of magic mushrooms22 this prompted albert hofmann to isolate psilocybin in 1958 for distribution by sandoz alongside lsd in the us further raising interest in lsd in the mass media23 following wassons report timothy leary visited mexico to try out the mushrooms which were used in traditional religious rituals lifes motto became24 to see life to see the world in the postwar years it published some of the most memorable images of events in the united states and the world it also produced many popular science serials such as the world we live in and the epic of man in the early 1950s the magazine continued to showcase the work of notable illustrators such as alton s tobey whose many contributions included the cover for a 1958 series of articles on the history of the russian revolution but as the 1950s drew to a close and tv became more popular the magazine was losing readers in may 1959 it announced plans to reduce its regular newsstand price to 19 cents a copy from 25 cents with the increase in television sales and viewership interest in news magazines was waning life had to try to create a new form 1960s and the end of an eraedit henri huets photograph of thomas cole featured on the cover of life

do know im a movie star and i like being a woman and i think sex is absolutely gorgeous but as far as a sex goddess i dont worry myself that way richard is a very sexy man hes got that sort of jungle essence that one can sense when we look at each other its like our eyes have fingers and they grab ahold i think i ended up being the scarlet woman because of my rather puritanical upbringing and beliefs i couldnt just have a romance it had to be a marriage25 in the 1960s the magazines photographs featured those by gordon parks the camera is my weapon against the things i dislike about the universe and how i show the beautiful things about the universe parks recalled in 2000 i didnt care about life magazine i cared about the people he said26 on march 25 1966 life featured the drug lsd

graduate school of journalism the prestigious award was made for the magazines publication of stunning photos from the war in southeast asia such as henri huets riveting series of a wounded medic that

accolades and publishing americas mission to the moon in 1969 the magazine continued to lose circulation time inc announced in january 1971 its decision to reduce circulation from 85 million to 7 million in an effort to offset shrinking advertising revenues exactly one year later life cut its circulation from 7 million to 55 million beginning with the january 14 1972 issue life was reportedly not losing money but its costs were rising faster than its profits life lost credibility with many readers when it supported author clifford irving whose fraudulent autobiography of howard hughes was revealed as a hoax in january 1972 the magazine had purchased serialization rights to irvings manuscript industry figures showed that some 96 percent of life circulation went to mail subscribers with
