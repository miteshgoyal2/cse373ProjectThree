the fbi was more interested in christian groups such as those led by billy and franklin graham than in groups that might be considered less politically correct to target attorney general eric holder

be adjusted for inflation going forward25 gohmert said that conservatives have advocated for years that there should be no automatic spending increases in any federal departments budget that has been a trap so when we simply slow the rate of increase we are accused of making draconian cuts26 he argued that this legislation would make clearer what is an increase and what is a cut put the government

better assessment of the babys health once it was born gohmert explained ms zink having my great sympathy and empathy both i still come back wondering shouldnt we wait like that couple did and see if the child can survive before we decide to rip him apart so these are ethical issues theyre moral issues they’re difficult issues and the parents should certainly be consulted but it just seems like

organizations associated with the muslim brotherhood48 one of the letters in particular to ambassador harold w geisel the deputy inspector general of the united states department of state mentioned the deputy chief of staff to secretary of state hillary clinton huma abedin as an example of the undue influence the letter said that abedin wife of former us representative anthony weiner who had access to sensitive national security and policy information has three family members–her late father her mother and her brother–connected to muslim brotherhood operatives andor organizations as backed up by a study by the center for security policy495051 the letter and the center for security policys accusation were widely denounced as a smear and achieved nearuniversal condemnation
