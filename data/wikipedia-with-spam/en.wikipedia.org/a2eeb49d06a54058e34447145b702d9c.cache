court system or provide regional boundaries for a state court system in many states certain government functions and services as well as taxing authority are further decentralized below the county level by dividing counties into incorporated municipalities such as cities towns and unincorporated areas some types of subdivisions such as townships may be either incorporated or unincorporated or both depending on the state the city town or populated place that houses county government is known as the seat of its respective county generally the county legislature county courthouse sheriffs department headquarters hall of records jail and correctional facility are located in the county seat though some functions may also be located or conducted in other parts of the county especially if it is geographically large a county seat is usually but not always an incorporated municipality the exceptions include the county seats of counties that have no incorporated municipalities within their borders such as arlington county virginia and howard county maryland ellicott city the county seat of howard county is the largest unincorporated county seat in the united states followed by towson the county seat of baltimore county maryland likewise some county seats may not be incorporated in their own right but are located within incorporated municipalities for example cape may court
