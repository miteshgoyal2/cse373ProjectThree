another coast salishan people in reference to the snoqualmie people4 historyedit the second written record of the exploration of the snoqualmie valley comes from the notes of samuel hancock who ventured upriver with the snoqualmie tribe in 1851 in search of coal near the current location of meadowbrook bridge hancock was told by his guides that the land was known as hyas kloshe illahee or goodproductive land hancock took this useful information back with him to the area now known as tacoma during the 1850s tensions were very high between the native populations and the new settlers claiming the land as their own in 1856 in response to these tensions fort alden was built in the area that would become snoqualmie no alliances were made between the tribes in the east and the tribes in the west and fort alden was abandoned along with other forts built around this time the most successful early pioneer in the valley was jeremiah borst who arrived in the spring of 1858 on his way over the cedar river trail from the eastern side of the mountains he settled in the area that formerly held fort alden and used his sales of pigs and apples in seattle to buy out many of the surrounding land from other settlers as successful as farming was other settlers had different methods of working the land the very first mill in snoqualmie was established at the mouth of tokul creek around 1872 by watson allen within 5 years there were 12 logging operations on the snoqualmie river providing lumber to the entire seattle region within 15 years logging and mill work was employing 140 men and sending millions of board feet of logs down the river in 1882 the hop growers association was founded by three puget sound partners who used land purchased from jeremiah borst to create a farm that would eventually cover 1500 acres 61 km2 900 acres 36 km2 of which was devoted solely to hops this extremely successful venture billed as the largest hop ranch in the world would fall prey to a combination of market and pest factors and fell into relative obscurity by the end of the 1890s by the late 19th century the puget sound region was growing but bypassed by the major railways in response a group of seattle entrepreneurs funded and built their own railway in an attempt to cross the cascade mountains the seattle lake shore eastern opened up the vast natural resources snoqualmie valley to the markets of the world and brought in tourists from around the world to enjoy the natural beauty of the area and to marvel at the falls church our lady of sorrows in snoqualmie of course a byproduct of this sudden massive increase in interest in the area was a marked increase in speculation originally the area that would become north bend was platted as snoqualmie in february 1889 by will taylor the area that is currently snoqualmie was platted in august of that same year as snoqualmie falls by investors from seattle the oral history of the area places the first residents of snoqualmie as edmund and louisa kinsey who established the first hotel livery general store dance hall post office and meat market – in addition to helping build the very first church in the town two of their sons out of six children are most famous for their photography documenting the early timber works in the region the first power plant at snoqualmie falls hydroelectric plant at the falls was built in the late 1890s by charles baker one of the investors from seattle who had assisted in the platting of the city this development provided both power and jobs to the region and a small company town grew up near the falls to house the workers more than 100 years later bakers original generators are still in use by puget sound energy the official vote for incorporation of snoqualmie falls as the city of snoqualmie occurred in 1903 at the time land prices had not decreased since initially set in 1889 — prices that did not reflect the financial reality of the region in response to these high prices people had created a large squatting community building where they wanted regardless of land ownership or interests the first challenge that the city council faced was lowering lot prices and migrating these buildings off of the public rightof way establishing the basic layout of the town that exists to this day in 1917 a new allelectric lumber mill only the second ever in the us opened across the river from snoqualmie along with the company town associated with it snoqualmie falls for the first half of the century the timber industry provided the city and valley with a stable source of income and employment even as world war i drew away workers and the great depression took its toll across the nation this prosperity was moderated during the depression and with the changes in culture and mobility that took effect in the latter half of the century snoqualmie and the majority of the valley fell into somewhat of a stagnant existence the city was bypassed when us10 was built across the cascades now interstate90 and this led to a shift in commerce to the east into north bend and west into the bellevueissaquah areas aerial image of snoqualmie ridge on a snowy day 2009 by the 1960s the homes that had made up the company town of snoqualmie falls had been moved to other locations within the valley and the citys population had stabilized to a growth rate of roughly 11 people per year over the next 30 years from 1216 in 1960 to 1546 in 1990 this slow growth cycle continued until the mid1990s when the city annexed 1300 acres 53 km2 of undeveloped land that became the site of the current masterplanned community of snoqualmie ridge now referred to as snoqualmie ridge i the snoqualmie ridge i master planned community includes 2250 dwelling units a business park a neighborhood center retail area and the tpc snoqualmie ridge a private pga toursanctioned golf course snoqualmie ridge ii annexed in 2004 will contain an additional 1850 dwelling units a hospital and a limited amount of additional retail snoqualmie ridge i is completely builtout except for several remaining parcels in the business park snoqualmie ridge ii is anticipated to be builtout in 20162018 the city council has attempted to balance the desire to retain the rural and historical feel of historic snoqualmie with the needs of a significantly larger population than has existed in the valley in the past the citys historic downtown is undergoing a major renovation to improve its infrastructure and make the area more attractive to visitors to the valleys many natural attractions5 in 2012 the city of snoqualmie annexed 593 acres of the former weyerhaeuser mill site and mill pond borst lake the former mill office now hosts dirtfish an advanced rally car driver training school the site

economyedit until recently logging and weyerhaeusers milling operations were the mainstays of the local economy since 1989 the company has run a much smaller mill operation and ceased all operations at the weyerhaeuser mill site in 2003 while dairies were a significant local industry into the early 1950s agriculture is no longer a major economic force in the community with the completion of interstate 90 in the 1970s snoqualmie became more accessible to seattle and the eastside resulting in more residents working in the communities to the west in addition the snoqualmie ridge business park now employs close to a thousand people and continues to expand major employers in the business park include space labs motion water sports technical glass tmobile zetec and the king county
