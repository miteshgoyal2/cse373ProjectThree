destroyed the entire central business district of seattle washington on june 6 1889 the fire burned for several hours destroying 25 blocks and causing as much as 20 million in damage 527 million in todays dollars as a result of the fire streets in the pioneer square neighborhood in seattle were elevated 22 feet 67 m above the prefire street level and new buildings made of wood were banned it also eventually led to the city of seattle switching from multiple private water suppliers to a single municipal water supply contents 1 early seattle 2 events of the fire 21 magnitude 22 reconstruction and recovery 23 postfire reform 3 references 4 further reading 5 external links early seattleedit in the fall of 1851 the denny party arrived at alki point in what is now the state of washington after spending a miserable winter on the western shores of elliott bay the party relocated to the eastern shores and established the settlement that would become seattle1 early seattle was dominated by the logging industry the combination of a safe bay and an abundance of coniferous trees made seattle the perfect location for shipping lumber to california in 1852 henry yesler began construction of the first steampowered mill in the pacific northwest2 because of the easy access to lumber nearly every building was constructed of the affordable but combustible timber additionally because the area was at or below sea level the fledgling town was a frequent victim of massive floods requiring buildings to be built on wooden stilts the town also used hollowed out scrap logs propped up on wooden braces as sewer and water pipes increasing the combustible loading events of the fireedit aftermath of seattle fire of june 6 1889 looking east at the ruins of the occidental hotel at corner of james st and yesler way the spring of 1889 in seattle had been beautiful there had been little rain and temperatures were consistently in the 70s fahrenheit unfortunately the unusually good weather proved to be disastrous as the dry conditions conspired with a handful of other elements to allow for the worst fire in city history3 on the afternoon of june 6 1889 john back a swedish assistant in victor clairmonts woodworking shop at the corner of front street now first avenue and madison avenue was heating glue over a gasoline fire sometime after 215 the glue boiled over caught fire and spread to the floors which were covered by wood chips and turpentine he tried to put the fire out with water but that only served to thin the turpentine and spread the fire further everyone got out of the building safely and the fire department got to the fire by 245 pm by that time there was so much smoke that it was hard to find the source of the fire and by the time it was found the fire was out of control at first it was assumed to have begun in the paint shop above clairmonts woodworking shop and the seattle newspaper erroneously ran this story the next day45 the fire quickly spread to the dietz mayer liquor store which exploded the crystal palace saloon and the opera house saloon fueled by immense amounts of alcohol the entire block from madison to marion was on fire seattles water supply proved to be a major problem in fighting the fire at that time water was provided by the privately owned spring hill water company fire hydrants were only located on every other street the pipes were small and many were made of hollowed out logs several of which would burn in the fire as more hoses were added to fight the fire water pressure fell to the point that the hoses stopped working firemen tried to keep the fire from spreading further by pumping water from elliott bay onto the commercial mill but the tide was out and the hoses were not long enough to reach the side of the building closest to the fire to add insult to injury crowds harassed the fire fighters as the water pressure fell at the same time the water supply was dwindling the wind rose helping spread the fire soon the mill was on fire as well as the colman building and opera house mayor robert moran took command from acting fire chief james murphy ironically chief josiah collins was at a firefighting convention in san francisco who was reportedly distraught moran ordered the colman block to be blown up in an attempt to end the fire but the fire jumped past the block and spread to the wharves as well as up the hill toward second avenue by 400 pm most residents realized that downtown seattle was doomed the fire had crossed second avenue and was heading up to third smoke could be seen in tacoma and the deafening roar of the fire was heard for miles help had been called in from tacoma portland and even victoria british columbia but would take hours to arrive business and homeowners cleared out as many products and possessions as they could those who were able hired wagons to haul belongings onto ships before the ships moved out of the harbor away from the wharves which were on fire the seattle times was able to get most of their files and books aboard the schooner teaser as the fire reached third avenue trinity church burned quickly and the fire moved across the street toward the threestory courthouse before long the fire had reached fourth and university but a handful of buildings were saved including the courthouse the fire department had tried to water down the courthouse to prevent it from burning but water pressure was so low the hoses could only spray the first floor quickwitted lawrence booth climbed to the roof of the courthouse and poured buckets of water down the sides of the building saving the structure as well as all the public records and the jail within booths lead inspired bucket brigades to save the boston block and jacob levys house henry yeslers house was also saved by someone who thought to cover it with wet blankets meanwhile the fire was spreading even farther before it reached yesler moran ordered that the shacks there be either torn down or blown up with explosives in the attempt to create another fire block despite such efforts the fire crossed the gap and skid road went up in flames next mayor moran declared an 800 pm curfew that night and ordered all saloons closed until further notice the fire burned until 300 am when it was done the damage was enormous 120 acres 25 city blocks had been destroyed as was every wharf and mill from union street to jackson street although the loss of human life was evidently low no statistics were kept on that it was estimated that 1 million rats were killed thousands of people were displaced and 5000 men lost their jobs the city estimated its losses at over 8 million and that number did not even include human losses or those of water and electrical services the total losses may have been as high as 20 million the city took little time to mourn instead seattle banded together and at 11 am on june 7 600 businessmen met to discuss how to cope with the current situation and plan for the future to combat looting two hundred special deputies were sworn in and the town placed under martial law for two weeks a relief committee was formed to handle the charitable donations that were being sent from all over the country tacoma no longer a rival but an ally in the time of need raised 20000 and sent up a relief committee to help the armory was converted to a dining hall so the displaced citizens would have a place to eat supplies from san francisco much of which had been ordered before the fire arrived by june 18 relief bureaus were able to close as quickly as june 20 as tentrestaurants had been set up quickly and were able to meet peoples needs within a month of the fire over 100 businesses were operating out of tents instead of relocating most businesses decided to rebuild where they had been and rebuilding began almost immediately wooden buildings were banned in the burned out district to be replaced by brick at the same time streets were raised up to 22 feet in places helping to level the hilly city within a year 465 buildings had been built most of the reconstruction was complete and the businesses had reopened the fire also led to a handful of other major changes for the city at the time of the fire the city had an allvolunteer fire department many of which quit after the fire citing the harassment they had faced while trying to fight the fire this personnel crisis led to the creation of a professional fire department by october 1889 the city also took control of the water supply increasing the size of the pipes eliminating the wooden pipes and added more fire hydrants the fire which could have spelled the end of the city instead became just a brief setback and led to many significant improvements magnitudeedit by the morning of june 7 the fire had burned 25 city blocks including the entire business district four of the citys wharves and its railroad terminals6 the fire would be called the most destructive fire in the history of seattle7 despite the massive destruction of property there was only one casualty reported a boy named james goin8 however there were fatalities during the cleanup process and an estimated 1 million rodents were killed total losses were estimated at nearly 20000000 533 million in todays dollars9 reconstruction and recoveryedit this stack of dishes fused together by the fire is on display at seattles museum of history and industry despite the magnitude of destruction the rebuilding effort began quickly rather than starting over somewhere else seattles citizens decided to rebuild seattle rebuilt from the ashes quickly the fire had done a fine job of cleansing the town of rats and other vermin a new building ordinance resulted in a downtown of brick and stone buildings rather than wood and at the same time the street levels were raised by up to 22 feet 67 m10 in the year following the fire seattles population actually grew by nearly 20000 to 40000 inhabitants from the influx of people helping to recreate the city11 supplies and funds came from all over the west coast to support the relief effort the population increase made seattle the largest city in washington making it a leading contender in becoming the terminus of the great northern railway12 postfire reformedit the city made many improvements in response to the fire the citys fire department shifted from a volunteer to a paid force with new firehouses and a new chief the city took control of the water supply increasing the number of fire hydrants and adding larger pipes10 the advent of brick buildings to downtown seattle was one of the many architectural improvements the city made in the wake of the fire new city ordinances set standards for the thickness of walls and required division walls between buildings13 these changes became principal features of postfire construction and are still visible in seattles pioneer square district today the presentday location of the fire at pioneer square guided tours are also available to paying customers also at this location visitors can tour the seattle underground where they can visit remains of buildings that were built
