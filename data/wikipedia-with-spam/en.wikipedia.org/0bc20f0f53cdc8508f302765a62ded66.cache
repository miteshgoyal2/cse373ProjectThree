renamed the busy mans magazine in december 1905 and began providing uniquely canadian perspective on varied topics such as immigration national defence home life womens suffrage and fiction maclean renamed the magazine after himself in 1911 dropping the previous title as too evocative of a business magazine for what had become a general interest publication5 maclean hired thomas b costain as editor in 1917 costain invigorated the magazines coverage of the first world war running firstperson accounts of life on the western front and critiques of canadas war effort that came into conflict with wartime censorship regulations costain was ordered to remove an article by maclean himself as it was too critical of war policycitation needed costain encouraged literary pieces and artistic expressions and ran fiction by robert w service lucy maud montgomery and o henry commentary by stephen leacock and illustrations by c w jefferys f s coburn and several group of seven members including a j casson arthur lismer and j e h macdonald6 in 1919 the magazine moved from monthly to fortnightly publication and ran an exposé of the drug trade by emily murphy in 1925 the circulation of the magazine was 82013 copies7 costain left the magazine to become a novelist and was replaced by j vernon mackenzie who remained at the helm until 1926 during his tenure macleans achieved national staturecitation needed after mackenzie h napier moore became the new editor an englishman he saw the magazine as an expression of canadas role in the british empire moore ultimately became a figurehead with the daytoday running of the magazine falling to managing editor w arthur irwin a canadian nationalist who saw the magazine as an exercise in nationbuilding giving it a mandate to promote national pride under irwins influence the magazines covers promoted canadian scenery and imagery the magazine also sponsored an annual short story contest on canadian themes and acquired a sports department irwin was also responsible for orienting the magazine towards both small and big l liberalism during the second world war macleans ran an overseas edition for canadian troops serving abroad by the time of its final run in 1946 the bantam edition had a circulation of 800000 macleans war coverage featured war photography by yousuf karsh later an internationally acclaimed portrait photographer and articles by war correspondents john clare and leonard shapiro irwin officially replaced moore as editor in 1945 and reoriented the magazine by building it around news features written by a new stable of writers that included pierre berton w o mitchell scott young ralph allen and blair fraser allen became editor upon irwins acceptance of a diplomatic posting in 1950 this era of the magazine was noted for its articles on the canadian landscape and profiles of town and city life the feature article canadas north by pierre berton promoted a new national interest in the arctic

challenged the criminal justice system explored lsd and artificial insemination macleans published an editorial the day after the 1957 federal election announcing the predictable reelection of the st laurent liberal party written before the election results were known allen failed to anticipate the upset election of the progressive conservative party under john diefenbaker the magazine struggled to compete with television in the 1960s by increasing its international coverage and attempting to keep up with the sexual revolution through a succession of editors including gzowski and charles templeton templeton quit after a short time at the helm due to his frustration with interference by the publishing company macleanhunter in 1961 macleans began publishing a frenchlanguage edition le magazine maclean which survived until 1976 when the edition was absorbed by lactualité peter c newman became editor in 1971 and attempted to revive the magazine by publishing feature articles by writers such as barbara frum and michael enright and poetry by irving layton walter stewart correspondent and eventually managing editor during this period often clashed with newman in 1975 newman brought in columnist allan fotheringham fotheringham made famous the back page where he wrote for 27 years readers would go to read the back page first and then proceed to read the magazine from back to front under newman the magazine switched from being a monthly general interest publication to a biweekly news magazine in 1975 and to a weekly newsmagazine three years later the magazine opened news bureaus across the country and in international bureaus in london england and washington dccitation needed 21st centuryedit in 2001 anthony wilsonsmith became the fifteenth editor in the magazines history he left the post at the end of february 2005 and was replaced by kenneth whyte who also serves as the magazines publisher the magazine has been owned by the rogers communications conglomerate since rogers acquired macleanhunter the former publisher in 19948 whyte who previously edited saturday night and the national post brought a rightwing focus to the magazine bringing in conservative columnist mark steyn hiring andrew coyne away from the post and rehiring barbara amiel he also added a comedy feature by former liberal party strategist scott feschuk and a column by andrew potter who previously wrote for left leaning periodicals the magazine has fifteen editions in canada9 rogers communications announced in september 2016 that due to falling print ad revenue the

canadian universitiesedit see also rankings of universities in canada cover of 2008 guide to canadian universities the macleans guide to canadian universities is published annually in march it is also known as macleans university guide it includes information from the macleans university rankings an issue of the magazine proper that is published annually in november primarily for students in their last year of high school and entering their first year in canadian universities both the guide and the rankings issue feature articles discussing canadian universities and ranking them by order of quality the rankings focus on taking a measure of the undergraduate experience11121313 comparing universities in three peer groupings primarily undergraduate comprehensive and medical doctoral schools in the primarily undergraduate category are largely focused on undergraduate education with relatively few graduate programs comprehensives have a significant amount of research activity and a wide range of graduate and undergraduate programs including professional degrees medical doctoral institutions have a broad range of phd programs and research as well as medical schools in early 2006 macleans announced that in june 2006 it would be introducing a new annual issue called the university student issue the issue would feature the results of a survey of recent university graduates from each canadian university however many universities such as the university of calgary mcmaster university and the university of toronto refused to take part in this exercise the three institutions stated that they questioned the magazines ability to conduct a survey that would be rigorous and provide accurate and useful information to students and their parents14 in response macleans sought the results of two universitycommissioned student surveys the canadian undergraduate survey consortium cusc and the national survey of student engagement nsse15 results from these surveys along with macleans own graduate survey were published in the june 26 2006 edition of macleans for the november 2006 university rankings issue 22 canadian universities refused to provide information directly to macleans to rank those universities the magazine relied on data it collected itself as well as data drawn from third party sources such as statistics canadacitation needed among the universities that refused to provide information directly to macleans in the fall of 2006 were university of british columbia university of toronto dalhousie university mcmaster university university of new brunswick university of manitoba université du québec network simon fraser university university of alberta university of calgary university of lethbridge ryerson university université de montréal university of ottawa york university concordia university university of western ontario lakehead university queens university carleton university and university of windsor the withholding of data served as a means of voicing the universities displeasure with the methodology used to determine the macleans ranking16 indira samarasekera president of the university of alberta further discussed this in the article rising up against rankings published in the april 2 2007 issue of inside higher ed17 the university rankings issue contains a compilation of different charts and lists judging the different aspects of universities in different categories the three main areas listed in chart form in the university rankings issue as at november 3 2006 are the overall rankings themselves the university student surveys and the magazines national reputational rankings of the schools the national reputational rankings like the main university rankings are broken into three subcategories medical doctoral comprehensive and primarily undergraduate and are based on opinions of the quality of the universities the quality opinions gathered were contributed by secondary school principals guidance counsellors organization and company heads and recruiters the results of the reputational rankings are included in the main university rankings and account for 16 of a universitys total ranking score controversyedit canadian islamic congress complaintedit main article human rights complaints against macleans magazine in december 2007 the canadian islamic congress cic launched complaints with the canadian human rights commission british columbia human rights commission and the ontario human rights commission against macleans accusing it of publishing 18 articles between january 2005 and july 2007 that they considered islamophobic in nature including a column by mark steyn titled the future belongs to islam181920 according to the cic complaint as discussed in a national post article by ezra levant macleans is flagrantly islamophobic and subjects canadian muslims to hatred and contempt21 in contrast levant says of the complainants that they are illiberal censors who have found a quirk in our legal system and are using it to undermine our western traditions of freedom21 on october 10 2008 the bc human rights tribunal dismissed the allegations of hate speech made by the canadian islamic congresscitation needed macleans consistently took the position that steyns article an excerpt from his bestselling book america alone is a worthy contribution to an important debate on geopolitical and demographic issues and that plaintiffs demands for equal space for a rebuttal was unreasonable and untenable22 quebec controversyedit the october 4 2010 edition of the magazine — webpublished september 24 2010 — had a cover article with the headline quebec the most corrupt province with the subheading inside the magazine why does quebec claim so many of the nations political scandals the cover illustration featured the quebec winter carnival mascot bonhomme carrying a suitcase overflowing with cash2324 this depiction angered some quebec politicians and organizers of the carnival25 on september 26 2010 quebec premier jean charest wrote a letter to the editor of macleans condemning the magazines twisted form of journalism and ignorance calling it sensationalist far from serious simplistic and offensive saying the editor discredited the magazine242627 in an example of the law of unintended consequences the controversy has had an unexpected benefit for the quebec liberal government the opposition in the quebec national assembly had been demanding that premier charest create a public inquiry into allegations of corruption and collusion in quebecs construction industry24 however seeing the macleans article as an attack from outside the province an attack from english canada and with their quebecs acute sensitivity to criticism coming from outside the province many in the provinces media and political classes have shifted their attention from the premier to the mischievous torontobased magazine24 thus his letter to the editor of macleans posits charest as the defender of quebecers in their 400year struggle to preserve their culture and language his letter demands that macleans apologize for publishing a simplistic and offensive thesis that quebecers are genetically incapable of acting with integrity24 in an editorial dated september 29 2010 the magazine refused to back away from its position visàvis corruption in quebec24 in the englishlanguage magazines bilingual editorial the editorial board says that charests response to the macleans article was an attempt to implicate ordinary citizens in a scandal created by its politicians it is bad enough that the people of quebec have to put up with corruption in public office – they shouldnt be smeared by it as well2428 notwithstanding this assertion macleans acknowledged that neither its cover story nor an accompanying column provided empirical evidence that quebec is more corrupt than other provinces24 this is not however a retreat from its contention that quebec is the most corrupt province given that the editorial board goes further saying its true that we lack a statistical database to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that quebec is an outlier among the provinces but that does not mean we are required to suspend all judgment in the face of a preponderance of evidence—scandal after scandal at every level of government in the province all of them involving not just one or two bad actors but systemic corruption28 macleans editors also note that none of our critics has mounted a credible case that any other province better deserves the title of worst in class28 moreover not all opinion in quebec runs contrary to macleans position the frenchlanguage la presse the provinces leading broadsheet wrote that macleans claim that quebec has a higher number of scandals is undeniable28 rhéal séguin writing in the globe mail notes that the englishlanguage montreal gazette however is of the opposite opinion editorializing that macleans is wrong it didnt come close to making its case27 despite the steadfast position of macleans editorial board the magazines publisher has issued a qualified apology on september 30 2010 referring to the controversy brian segal the president of rogers publishing apologized for any offence that the cover may have caused saying the province is an important market for the company and we look forward to participating in the dynamic growth of the province and its citizens29 finally regarding bonhomme carnaval organizers of carnaval de québec sued macleans over the controversial cover showing the iconic figure settling out of court in november 201030 too asian articleedit main article macleans too asian controversy the university ranking issue courted controversy when in november 2010 under the editorship of kenneth whyte and mark stevenson reporter stephanie findlay and senior writer nicholas köhler wrote an article about the perceived overrepresentation of asian students at canadian universities entitled too asian31 this led to allegations that macleans intentionally perpetuated racial stereotypes to court controversy for the sake of publicity3233343536 amidst criticism from a number of student unions and politicians on december 16 2010 torontos city council voted to request an apology from macleans magazine as the third canadian city to do so after victoria and vancouver3738 in a letter to the minister of canadian heritage senator vivienne poy suggested that public outrage over the macleans article defined as material that is denigrating to an identifiable group should deem it ineligible for government funding3334 negro patois controversyedit in may 2015 macleans published an oped written by conrad blacks wife barbara amiel lady black of crossharbour lady black used the word negro to describe black people whom she described collectively as a heap with barack obama at the top and an inert black underclass at the bottom the article was entitled class not race is americas real problem 39 this article is colloquially referred to as the negro patois article blackface controversyedit on january 16 2015 writer martin patriquin a white quebecois explained to macleans readers that the blackface used to portray africancanadian hockey maverick pk subban in a montreal play was not actual blackface the article is entitled when blackface isn’t
