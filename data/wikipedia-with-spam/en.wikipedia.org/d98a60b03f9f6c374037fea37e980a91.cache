screwtensioned drumhead they are usually played in sets of two to four with the fingers and palms of the hand typical congas stand approximately 75 centimetres 30 in from the bottom of the shell to the head the drums may be played while seated alternatively the drums may be mounted on a rack or stand to permit the player to play while standing while they originated in cuba their incorporation into the popular and folk music of other countries has resulted in diversification of terminology for the instruments and the players in cuba congas are called tumbadoras conga players are called congueros while rumberos refers to those who dance following the path of the players the term conga was popularized in the 1930s when latin music swept the united states cuban son and new york jazz fused together to create what was then termed mambo but later became known as salsa in that same period the popularity of the conga line helped to spread this new term desi arnaz also played a role in the popularization of conga drums however the drum he played which everyone called a conga drum at the time was similar to the type of drum known as bokú used in his hometown santiago de cuba the word conga came from the rhythm la conga used during carnaval carnival in cuba the drums used in carnaval could have been referred to as tambores de conga since they played the rhythm la conga and thus translated into english as conga drums playing techniquesedit strokesedit there are five basic strokes open tone is played with the four fingers near the rim of the head producing a clear resonant tone with a distinct pitch muffled or mute tone tono ahogado like the open tone is made by striking the drum with the four fingers but holding the fingers against the head to muffle the tone bass tone tono bajo played with the full palm on the head it produces a low muted sound slap tone tono seco the most difficult technique producing a loud clear popping sound when played at fast and short intervals is called floreo played to instill emotion in the dancer touch tone toque de punta as implied by the name this tone is produced by just touching the fingers or heel of the palm to the drum head it is possible to alternate a touch of the palm with a touch of the fingers in a maneuver called heeltoe manoteo which can be used to produce the conga equivalent of drumrolls glissando and pitch bendingedit the moose call or glissando is done by rubbing the third finger supported by the thumb across the head of the drum the finger is sometimes moistened with saliva or sweat and sometimes a little coat of beeswax is put on the surface of the conga head to help make the sound12 the moose call is also done on the bongos to bend the pitch of the congas a conguero sometimes uses his elbow to shift around on and apply pressure to different parts of the head this causes the note to change this is not a traditional stroke but it is common in modern salsa and rumba rhythmsedit guaguancóedit guaguancó uses three congas the smallest conga is the lead drum known as quinto the following ninemeasure quinto excerpt is from the guaguancó “la polémica” by los muñequitos de matanzas 19883 this passage moves between the main modes of playing abc the a section is the basic lock or ride as it is known in north america it spans one clave measure an alternate phrase b is also one measure in length crossbeats the basis of the third section c contradict the meter by alternating between the lock and the cross the quinto creates larger rhythmic phrases that expand and contract over several clave cycles the great los muñequintos quintero jesús alfonso 1949–2009 described this phenomenon as a man getting “drunk at a party going outside for a while and then coming back inside”4 all modes of quinto in context quinto excerpt from “la polémica” by los muñequitos de matanzas 1988 marcha tumbaoedit claveneutraledit the basic son montuno conga pattern is called marcha or tumbao the conga was first used in bands during the late 1930s and became a staple of mambo bands of the 1940s the primary strokes are sounded with open tones on the last offbeats 2 2a of a twobeat cycle the fundamental accent—2 is referred to by some musicians as ponche5 1 e a 2 e a count h t s t h t o o conga l l r l l l r r hand used key l left hand r right hand h heel of hand t tip of hand s slap o

common variant sounds a single open tone with the third stroke of clave ponche and two tones preceding the threeside of clave the specific alignment between clave and this tumbao is critical top clave

is used for ballads the conga part is similar to the marcha and can be heard on these recordings buena vista social club by buena vista social club melodía del río by ruben gonzález bésame mucho by andrea bocelli la puerta by luis miguel songo eraedit beginning in the late 1960s band conga players began incorporating elements from folkloric rhythms especially rumba changuito and raúl el yulo cárdenas of los van van pioneered this approach of the songo era this relationship between the drums is derived from the style known as rumba the feeling of the high drum part is like the quinto in rumba constantly punctuating coloring and accenting but not soloing until the appropriate moment santos 19858 basic form of songo tumbadoras part triangle notehead highpitched drum slap regular noteheads high and low drum open tones in several songo arrangements the tumbadora conga part sounds the typical tumbao on the lowpitched drum while replicating the quinto lead drum of guaguancó on the highpitched drum the quintolike phrases can continually change but they are based upon a specific counterclave motif9 see songo patterns on congas changuito timba eraedit tomás cruz developed several adaptions of folkloric rhythms when working in paulito fgs timba band of the 1990s cruzs creations offered clever counterpoints to the bass and chorus many of his marchas span two or even four claves in duration something very rarely done previously10 he also made more use of muted tones in his tumbaos all the while advancing the development of the example on the right is one of cruzs inventos musical inventions a band adaptation of the congolesebased afrocuban folkloric rhythm makuta he played the pattern on three congas on the paulito song llamada anónima listen llamada anónima by paulito fg use in noncuban genresedit dominicanedit the merengue rhythm used in orchestral merengue goes 1 212 it can also be heard as 1212 121212 essentially it is the rhythm of the tambora applied to conga this can be heard on elvis crespos suavemente and grupo manias me miras y te miro in merengue tipico the rhythm is usually more complex and less standardized it can range from simply hitting the conga on a fourth beat to playing full patterns that mark the time the rhythm of palos is also representative of what we can call afrodominican music the drums are made out of hollowedout tree trunks and they are used both for secular and religious music in santo domingo and haiti the drums are called palos alcahuete palo mayor and adulon the balsie is another drum played with both feet and hands the player sits on it and uses a friction technique called arrugao panderos are also used in dominican folk music like congos salve and palos the dominican version of the clave is la canoita which are two sticks struck against each other one with a handle in the gaga they also use palo drums and in the rhythm called palo de muerto which is played when a member of the cofradia or brotherhood dies the rhythm of palos is played throughout the dominican republic and is the national dance of the country this music was suppressed and persecuted during trujillos rule due to social and racial discrimination colombianedit the cumbia rhythm simple and slowly played goes 1221 also heard as 1212 it can be heard in fito olivaress mosaico fiestero and la cumbia sampuesana y la cumbia cienaguera by ancieto molino y los sabaneros additional genresedit there are many other kinds of rhythms for the conga it is constantly applied in new genres of music therefore taking up the rhythms of that specific style such as punta reggaeton brazilian forms such as samba and bossa nova and even reggae funk gogo and country music tuningedit conga drums are tunable to different notes the original drums were tuned by adjusting knots and tension ropes on the drumhead or where the drumheads were tacked or nailed to the top of the shell by careful heating of the head modern congas use a screwandlug tension head system which makes them easier to tune or detune this modern type of tension system is attributed to carlos patato valdes a popular cuban conguero as was discussed above terminology for the drums varies here the naming system used is a composite of those mentioned before with those currently in use by major conga manufacturers the drums are discussed in order from largest to smallest the sizes of the drumheads given vary considerably by manufacturer model and style the supertumba can be as large as 14 inches across 355 cm the tumba is typically 12 to 125 inches across 305 to 318 cm the conga is typically 115 to 12 inches across 292 to 305 cm the quinto is typically around 11 inches across about 28 cm the requinto can be smaller than 10 inches across 248 cm the ricardo can be as small as 9 inches across 229 cm since this drum is typically played while hanging from a shoulder strap it is considerably shorter and narrower than a traditional conga tuning systemsedit congas being percussive instruments do not have to be tuned to any particular note in purely percussive settings however when playing with harmonic instruments they may be tuned to specific notes congas are often tuned using the open tone see above in general the particular note will depend on the make model and size of the conga drum the drum should be tuned so that the bass tone resonates the open tone rings and the slap pierces through the musical mix if the tuning is too loose the bass and slap tones will sound flabby too tight and the drums will sound unnatural and pinched with a single drum it is easy to tighten the drum until it makes a pleasing sound and then tighten a little more to reach a uniform desired pitch it is very important to ensure that tuning is uniform around the drumhead which can be checked by placing one finger pad in the center of the head and tapping the head near the edge above each lug location to detect any change adjusting as necessary uniform tightness will help let the drum speak another important consideration is that head tension can greatly impact the ease or unease of the player and generally a looser drumhead can lead to hand injury more than a tighter one because a looser drumhead has less rebound and more muffling effect hence potentially bruising joints and bones under spirited playing also producing a crisp slap tone is nearly impossible on a loose head during tuning it is suggested to let the drum speak and to conform tuning reasonably closely to the natural resonance pitch that the cavity of the drum interior presents this resonance can be heard by singing or playing loud notes near the drum opening this is true of tuning any drum and noticing which pitch decays slowest that will either be the fundamental resonant frequency or one of its simple overtones when two or more drums are used there is the potential for more variation of which notes are chosen however tuning between or during compositions is rare in live performance with only two drums it is common to find them tuned a perfect fourth apart the same interval used in here comes the bride as is the tradition in western classical music for the timpani having three drums typically the tumba conga and quinto invites experimentation and individual customization some congueros like using the intervals of a major chord eg f a c some players use the second inversion of a major chord eg g c e and some prefer a major second between the quinto and conga with a perfect 4th descending to the tumba raul rekow of santana often
