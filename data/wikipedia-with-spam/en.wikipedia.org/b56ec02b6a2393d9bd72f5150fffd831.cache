wealth to promote various causes in 1985 he cowrote the charity single we are the world with lionel richie which was released worldwide to aid the poor in africa and the us the single became one of the bestselling singles of all time with nearly 20 million copies sold and millions of dollars donated to famine relief it was also the first time jackson was seen as a humanitarian3 all of the profits from his single man in the mirror went to charity45 jackson founded the heal the world foundation in 1992 inspired by his charity single of the same name67 following the illness and death of ryan white jackson helped draw public attention to hivaids something that was still controversial at the time he publicly pleaded with the clinton administration at bill clintons inaugural gala to give more money to hivaids charities and research he would go on to perform the song gone too soon for white and other victims of the illness89 productionedit earth song was originally written and composed by jackson in the hotel imperial in vienna austria under the title what about us a demo which featured jackson singing the ending in falsetto was to be released as part of a bonus disc for the remastered dangerous album in 2001 but the release was cancelled the song along with other tracks were leaked on the internet production of the song was a collaborative effort between jackson david foster and bill bottrell10 andrae crouchs choir and jackson engage in a back and forth chant as the song reaches its climactic finale11 jacksons intent was to create a song that was lyrically deep yet melodically simple so the whole world particularly nonenglishspeaking fans could sing along he conceptualized a song that had an emotional message12 compositionedit earth song is a ballad that incorporates elements of blues gospel and opera in the socially conscious track jackson issues a wakeupcall about the dire situations that mankind has caused and is facing ranging from war to devastation to animals and earth itself the song reveals itself to be highly spiritual at the end where jackson calls on people to remember the earth is their inheritance from god via their ancestor abraham what about death again reminds all to think about eternal death asking people to check their heart for repentance or to see if they really cared at all having disfellowshipped himself from jehovahs witnesses jackson simplified his faith to focus on the biblical jesus christ until his death 1311415 the song is written in the key of ab melodic minor16 critical responseedit earth song received mixed reviews from music critics james hunter of rolling stone stated the slow bluesoperatic earth song for all its noble sentiments sounds primarily like a showpiece1 a san jose mercury news review called it flat and whiny believing jackson had already experimented with these concepts earlier in his career17 the philadelphia inquirer described the track as a healing rhythmic ballad that evokes religious imagery15 a review in the sacramento bee was favorable describing jacksons vocal performance as cool18 michael mehle of rocky mountain news described the finale as anthemic and a powerful gospel opus14 a ledgerenquirer review observed of earth song it enjoys the same kind of subtlety building to a dramatic callandresponse finish with the andrae crouch choir11 contra costa timess review called it a bit sappy and overblown but also acknowledged that it was epic and destined to be a massive smash hit19 commercial performanceedit in the united kingdom earth song debuted at number one on the uk singles chart where it remained for six weeks throughout december 1995 — beating the u2brian eno project passengers in competition to win the christmas number one spot — and into early19962021 during its stay at number one earth song kept the first single released by the beatles in 25 years free as a bird off the number one position in early december bookmakers correctly predicted that jackson would keep the beatles off the top position and go on to attain the christmas numberone single2223 it has gone on to sell 1210297 copies in the nation as of september 201724 the

on the european hot 100 singles chart following the visionary the video singles campaign whereby 20 of jacksons hit singles from the 1980s to the 1990s were reissued in several european countries28 environmental recognitionedit jackson received the genesis award 1995 doris day music award given each year for animal sensitivity20 in 2008 a writer for the nigeria exchange noted earth song drew the worlds attention to the degradation and bastardization of the earth as a fall out of various human activities29 music videoedit jackson walking in a burnt down forest this section of the music video was simulated in a corn field the music video for earth song directed by fine art photographer nick brandt was expensive and wellreceived it gained a le film fantastique best video award in 1996 the 1995 doris day music award at the genesis awards and a grammy nomination for best music video short form in 1997 the production had an environmental theme showing images of animal cruelty deforestation pollution poverty and war jackson and the worlds people unite in a spiritual chant—earth song—which summons a force that heals the world using special effects time is reversed so that life returns war ends and the forests regrow the video closes with a request for donations to jacksons heal the world foundation2030 the clip was shown infrequently in the united states31 the video was filmed in four geographic regions americas europe and africa the first location was the amazon rainforest where a large part was destroyed a week after the videos completion natives of the region appeared in the video and were not actors the second scene was a war zone in karlovac croatia with famous serbian actor slobodan dimitrijević and the residents of the area the third location was tanzania which incorporated scenes of illegal poaching and hunting into the video no animals were harmed in the making of the earth song as the footage came from documentary archives the final location was in warwick new york where a safe forest fire was simulated in a corn field30 the video was also included on the video albums history on film volume ii number ones and michael jacksons vision brit awards incidentedit jackson during a performance of earth song at the history tour in 1997 the singer dangled from the edge of a crane in a similar manner at the brit awards in 1996 jackson performed earth song at the brit awards in the united kingdom he was there to collect a special artist of a generation award jackson sang while dangling off the edge of a high rise crane elevator which he had used the year before while performing it on the german tv show wetten dass below a chorus of backing performers joined in and many began to embrace jackson upon his descent during the performance singer jarvis cocker ran onstage without permission lifted his shirt and pretended to break wind before giving jackson the vsign203233 cocker was there with his band pulp who had been nominated for three brit awards34 he was questioned by police over claims he had assaulted some of the child performers but he was later released without charge3435 cocker stated that he found the performance offensive claiming that jackson had portrayed himself as christlike and could do as he pleased because of his immense wealth and power203233 jackson condemned cockers behavior as disgusting and cowardly34 the incident is referred to in the book politics and popular culture by john street professor of politics at the university of east anglia he says but to read popular culture as a straightforward – or at least typical – political text is to take a very narrow view of its meaning and hence of its political messages as we have noted the texts meaning will depend on how it is heard and read michael jackson may have intended his earth song as an exercise in compassion others – like jarvis cocker – saw it quite differently one reason these alternative readings emerge is because of the way the performance of popular culture engages more than a literal text it employs gestures and symbols tones of voice looks and glances all of which might tell a different story36 2010 grammy awards performanceedit the song along with a 3d short film that was to be featured in jacksons series of comeback concerts this is it was performed as a tribute to jackson jennifer hudson carrie underwood smokey robinson celine dion and usher all sang the song together while the video played in the background the film was shown in its original 3d format during the broadcast target provided free 3d glasses to customers a week before the grammy awards paris and prince jackson jacksons oldest children appeared shortly after the performance to accept jacksons lifetime achievement award where they both gave a short speech this was the first time the children had spoken publicly since the memorial service that was held for jackson on july 7 2009 charts and certificationsedit
