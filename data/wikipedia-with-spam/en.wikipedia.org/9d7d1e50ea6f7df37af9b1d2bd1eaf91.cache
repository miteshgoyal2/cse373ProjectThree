were all uptempo danceoriented funk and disco songs shes out of my life was an emotional ballad the song has a tempo of 66 beats per minute making it one of jacksons slowest songs2 jacksons vocals on

10 references 11 external links backgroundedit a poignant moment in the song occurs near the end when jackson begins to break down in tears as he sings the word life given the popular response to his emotional rendition the song remained in jacksons live set for many years although he had attempted to record the songs last few moments with emotional restraint after numerous tries he continued to end the rendition the same by breaking down in tears producer quincy jones subsequently let jacksons tearful recording stand shes out of my life id been carrying around for about three years—you can feel the pain in it you know and i held on to it and finally something said this is the right moment to give it to michael and when we recorded it with michael i know it was an experience hed never even thought about to sing in a song cause its a very mature emotion and he cried at the end of every take you know we recorded about—i dont know—811 takes and every one at the end he just cried and i said hey thats supposed to be leave it on there —quincy jones off the wall 2001 special edition quincy jones interview 3 according to jackson in moonwalk the song is about knowing that barriers separating him from others are seemingly easy to overcome yet they cause him to miss out on what he really desires3 he said that he cried from the sudden effect of the words because i had been letting so much build up inside me3 particularly it reminded him of his feeling of being so rich in some experiences while being poor in moments of true joy3 he worried about this feeling showing up on the song but also felt if it touched peoples heartstrings knowing that would make me feel less lonely3 he described making off the wall as one of the most difficult periods of my lifei had very few close friends at the time and felt very isolated3 he would walk through his neighborhood hoping to meet people who didnt know who he was so he could meet somebody who would be my friend because they liked me and needed a friend too not because i was who i am3 jones wanted jackson to record material with more mature themes and feel the full range of his voice so he brought the song to jacksons attention whereas he had originally intended to save the song for frank sinatra4 subsequently the song peaked at 10 in the united states on the billboard hot 1005 the single was even more successful in the uk and peaked at number 3 on the charts the equivalent position reached by off the walls debut single dont stop til you get enough a music video was also produced to promote the song which showed michael in a bluegreen shirt dark pants and sitting on a barstool with a spotlight shining behind him6 critical receptionedit allmusic editor stephen thomas erlewine highlighted it and called it overwrought ballad7 rolling stone editor stephen holden praised the singers ultradramatic phrasing which takes huge emotional risks and wins every time wrings the last drop of pathos from tom bahlers tearjerker
