regards to the meaning of the term enterprise architecture as of 2012 no official definition exists rather various organizations public and private promote their understanding of the term consequently the enterprise architecture literature offers many definitions for the term enterprise architecture some of which are complementary others are nuances and others yet are in opposition2 the mit center for information systems research mit cisr in 2007 defined enterprise architecture as the specific aspects of a business that are under examination enterprise architecture is the organizing logic for business processes and it infrastructure reflecting the integration and standardization requirements of the companys operating model the operating model is the desired state of business process integration and business process standardization for delivering goods and services to customers3 the enterprise architecture body of knowledge defines enterprise architecture as a practice which analyzes areas of common activity within or between organizations where information and other resources are exchanged to guide future states from an integrated viewpoint of strategy business and technology4 it analysis firm gartner defines the term as a discipline where an enterprise is led through change according to their glossary enterprise architecture ea is a discipline for proactively and holistically leading enterprise responses to disruptive forces by identifying and analyzing the execution of change toward desired business vision and outcomes ea delivers value by presenting business and it leaders with signatureready recommendations for adjusting policies and projects to achieve target business outcomes that capitalize on relevant business disruptions ea is used to steer decision making toward the evolution of the future state architecture5 each of the definitions above underplays the historical reality that enterprise architecture emerged from methods for documenting and planning information systems architectures and the current reality that most enterprise architecture practitioners report to a cio or other it department manager in a business organization structure today the enterprise architecture team performs an ongoing business function that helps business and it managers to figure out the best strategies to support and enable business development and business change – in relation to the business information systems that the business depends on topicsedit the terms enterprise and architectureedit the term enterprise can be defined as describing an organizational unit organization or collection of organizations that share a set of common goals and collaborate to provide specific products or services to customers6 in that sense the term enterprise covers various types of organizations regardless of their size ownership model operational model or geographical distribution it includes those organizations complete sociotechnical systems7 including people information processes and technologies the term architecture refers to fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements relationships and in the principles of its design and evolution8 understood as a sociotechnical system the term enterprise defines the scope of the enterprise architecture scopesedit perspectives or beliefs held by enterprise architecture practitioners and scholars with regards to the meaning of the enterprise architecture typically gravitate towards one or a hybrid of three schools of thought9 enterprise it design – the purpose of ea is the greater alignment between it and business concerns the main purpose of enterprise architecture is to guide the process of planning and designing the itis capabilities of an enterprise in order to meet desired organizational objectives typically architecture proposals and decisions are limited to the itis aspects of the enterprise other aspects only serve as inputs enterprise integrating – according to this school of thought the purpose of ea is to achieve greater coherency between the various concerns of an enterprise hr it operations etc including the linking between strategy formulation and execution typically architecture proposals and decisions encompass all the aspects of the enterprise enterprise ecological adaptation – the purpose of ea is to foster and maintain the learning capabilities of enterprises so that they may be sustainable consequently a great deal of emphasis is put on improving the capabilities of the enterprise to improve itself to innovate and to coevolve with its environment typically proposals and decisions encompass both the enterprise and its environment one’s belief with regards to the meaning of enterprise architecture will impact how one sees its purpose its scope the means of achieving it the skills needed to conduct it and the locus of responsibility for conducting it9 architectural description of an enterpriseedit according to the standard isoiecieee 420108 the product used to describe the architecture of a system is called an architectural description in practice an architectural description contains a variety of lists tables and diagrams these are models known as views in the case of enterprise architecture these models describe the logical business functions or capabilities business processes human roles and actors the physical organization structure data flows and data stores business applications and platform applications hardware and communications infrastructurecitation needed the uk national computing centre ea best practice guidance10 states normally an ea takes the form of a comprehensive set of cohesive models that describe the structure and functions of an enterprise the individual models in an ea are arranged in a logical manner that provides an everincreasing level of detail about the enterprise the architecture of an enterprise is described with a view to improving the manageability effectiveness efficiency or agility of the business and ensuring that money spent on information technology it is justifiedcitation needed paramount to changing the enterprise architecture is the identification of a sponsor hisher mission vision and strategy and the governance framework define all roles responsibilities and relationships involved in the anticipated transformation changes considered by enterprise architects typically include innovations in the structure or processes of an organization innovations in the use of information systems or technologies the integration andor standardization of business processes and improving the quality and timeliness of business information a methodology for developing and using architecture to guide the transformation of a business from a baseline state to a target state sometimes through several transition states is usually known as an enterprise architecture framework a framework provides a structured collection of processes techniques artifact descriptions reference models and guidance for the production and use of an enterprisespecific architecture description see also architecture domain benefitsedit the benefits of enterprise architecture are achieved through its direct and indirect contributions to organizational goals it has been found that the most notable benefits of enterprise architecture can be observed in the following areas11 organizational design enterprise architecture provides support in the areas related to design and redesign of the organizational structures during mergers acquisitions or during general organizational change12131415 organizational processes and process standards enterprise architecture helps enforce discipline and standardization of business processes and enable process consolidation reuse and integration1617 project portfolio management enterprise architecture supports investment decisionmaking and work prioritization1314 project management enterprise architecture enhances the collaboration and communication between project stakeholders enterprise architecture contributes to efficient project scoping and to defining more complete and consistent project deliverables1516 requirements engineering enterprise architecture increases the speed of requirement elicitation and the accuracy of requirement definitions through publishing of the enterprise architecture documentation18 system development enterprise architecture contributes to optimal system designs and efficient resource allocation during system development and testing1314 it management and decision making enterprise architecture is found to help enforce discipline and standardization of it planning activities and to contribute to a reduction in time for technologyrelated decision making1417 it value enterprise architecture helps reduce the systems implementation and operational costs and minimize replication of it infrastructure services across business units1719 it complexity enterprise architecture contributes to a reduction in it complexity consolidation of data and applications and to better interoperability of the

according to feapo an enterprise architecture practice collaborates with many interconnected disciplines including performance engineering and management process engineering and management it and enterprise portfolio management governance and compliance it strategic planning risk analysis information management metadata management and a wide variety of technical disciplines as well as organizational disciplines such as organizational development transformation innovation and learning increasingly many practitioners have stressed the important relationship of enterprise architecture with emerging holistic design practices such as design thinking systems thinking and user experience design1 as enterprise architecture has emerged in various organizations the broad reach has resulted in this business role being included in the information technology governance processes of many organizations while this may imply that enterprise architecture is closely tied to it it should be viewed in the broader context of business optimization in that it addresses business architecture performance management and process architecture as well as more technical subjects discussions of the intersection of enterprise architecture and various it practices have been published by various it analysis firms gartner and forrester have stressed the important relationship of enterprise architecture with emerging holistic design practices such as design thinking and user experience design262728 analyst firm real story group suggested that enterprise architecture and the emerging concept of the digital workplace were two sides to the same coin29 the cutter consortium describes enterprise architecture as an information and knowledgebased discipline30 the enterprise architecture of an organization is too complex and extensive to document in its entirety so knowledge management techniques provide a way to explore and analyze these hidden tacit or implicit areas in return enterprise architecture provides a way of documenting the components of an organization and their interaction in a systemic and holistic way that complements knowledge management31 in various venues32 enterprise architecture has been discussed as having a relationship with service oriented architecture a particular style of application integration research points to enterprise architecture promoting the use of soa as an enterprisewide integration pattern3334 toolsedit the following table lists some enterprise architecture tools listed by gartner and forrester research in their 2013 and

for more than a decade writers and organizations raised concerns about enterprise architecture as an effective practice here is a partial list of those objections in 2007 computer scientist ivar jacobson a major contributor to uml and pioneer in oo software development gave his assessment of enterprise architecture around the world introducing an enterprise architecture ea has been an initiative for most financial institutions banks insurance companies government etc for the last five years or so and it is not over i have been working with such companies and helped some of them to avoid making the worst mistakes most ea initiatives failed my guess is that more than 90 never really resulted in anything useful38 in a 2007 report on enterprise architecture gartner predicted that by 2012 40 of 2007’s enterprise architecture programs will be stopped39 a 2008 study by performed by erasmus university rotterdam and software company ids scheer concluded that twothirds of enterprise architecture projects failed to improve business and it alignment40 in a 2009 article industry commentator dion hinchcliffe wrote that traditional enterprise architecture might be broken at its very best enterprise architecture provides the bright lines that articulate the full range of possibilities for a business even describing how to go about getting there recently there’s a growing realization that traditional enterprise architecture as it’s often practiced today might be broken in some important way what might be wrong and how to fix it are the questions du jour41 in 2011 federal enterprise architecture consultant stanley gaver released a report that examined problems within the united states federal government’s enterprise architecture program mr gaver concluded that the federal enterprise architecture program had mostly failed this conclusion was corroborated by a similar one made by the federal government at an october 2010 meeting that was held to determine why the federal enterprise architecture program was not as influential and successful as in the past42 a key concern about ea has been the difficulty in arriving at metrics of success because of the broadbrush and often opaque nature of ea projects43 see alsoedit book enterprise architecture architectural pattern computer science architecture of integrated information systems architecture of
