the new ronald reagan ucla medical center opened and became fully operational replacing the older facilities across the street the older hospital complex had suffered moderate interior structural damage in the 1994 northridge earthquake4 because numerous hospitals in the area were severely damaged during the northridge earthquake and injured people had to be transported long distances for emergency care the state of california passed sb1953 an amendment to an older law requiring all hospitals to move their acute care and intensive care units into earthquakeresistant buildings by 2008 originally budgeted at 598 million in 1998 construction began in 1999 and was completed in 2004 cost overruns and construction delays attributed to rising construction costs and design changes due to medical advances resulted in the price of the building increasing to 829 million equipment purchased for the new building increased the total cost to over 1 billion4 the federal emergency management agency contributed 432 million in earthquake relief funds to the project and the state of california contributed 44 million private donations raised over 300 million for the project including 150 million in president reagans name the new building was constructed to withstand an 80 magnitude earthquake one of the first buildings in california built to the most recent seismic standards4 the new 1050000squarefoot 98000 m2 hospital is named after the late president of the united states and governor of california ronald reagan 19112004 it was designed by cc didi pei of pei partnership architects in collaboration with his father renowned pritzker prizewinning architect im pei4 and has been claimed to be the most technologically advanced hospital in the world the hospital will contain fewer patient beds 525 than the one it replaces patient beds in the intensivecare units will be accessible to nurses and physicians from 360 degrees and surgical floor plans will be modular allowing them to be expanded and reconfigured as medical technology evolves the hospital is sheathed with mechanically honed cream colored horizontally grained travertine marble panels sold at belowmarketrate cost by primo marrioti the owner of an italian quarry whose cancer was cured at ucla the travertine elements were fastened to a sophisticated interlocking panelized aluminum cladding system developed by benson industries of portland oregon the building envelope is designed to resist and survive severe seismic events and maintain excellent resistance to air and water infiltration the older center itself is a sprawling 11story brick building designed by welton becket it is considered a landmark of early modern architecture the center was built in several phases the first of which was completed in 1953 the hospital has a tictactoe layout of intersecting wings creating a series of courtyards throughout the complex the first floor is unusual in that most of its walls are completely clad in a thick layer of naturallyweathered unfilled travertine creating an unusual organic appearance the exterior architecture is very simple as with many becket designs consisting of a red brick wall with horizontal bands of stainlesssteel louvers over the windows to keep direct sunlight from heating the building some of the old complex will be torn down and some of it will be renovated and turned into office space when it is no longer an operational hospital the law does not require that all parts of a hospital be made earthquakesafe only the most important parts much of the extensive travertine wall cladding from the buildings interior will most likely be salvaged and reused area covered for the paramedicsedit ronald reagan ucla medical center has covered paramedic

only 135 cases of cre being reported as a result11 some doctors believe several more outbreaks of this nature are imminent since the outbreak demands have been made to the fda to improve their
