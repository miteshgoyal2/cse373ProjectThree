soared disco music and disco dancing provided an escape from these negative economic issues as well in the 1970s the key counterculture of the 1960s the hippie movement was fading away the disco movement was far more than just music it was also a subculture based around nightclubs dance clubs and djs in beautiful things in popular culture simon frith highlights the sociability of disco and its roots in 1960s counterculture the driving force of the new york underground dance scene in which disco was forged was not simply that citys complex ethnic and sexual culture but also a 1960s notion of community pleasure and generosity that can only be described as hippie he says the best disco music contained within it a remarkably powerful sense of collective euphoria30 film critic roger ebert called the popular embrace of discos exuberant dance moves an escape from the general depression and drabness of the political and musical atmosphere of the late seventies31 pauline kael writing about the discothemed film saturday night fever said the film and disco itself touched on something deeply romantic the need to move to dance and the need to be who youd like to be nirvana is the

kensington the track love hangover by diana ross the house anthem at the former was cited as a particular favourite by many early uk punks38 also the film the great rock n roll swindle and its

records ended with a riot during which the raucous crowd tore out seats and pieces of turf and caused other damage the chicago police department made numerous arrests and the extensive damage to the field forced the white sox to forfeit the second game to the detroit tigers who had won the first game six months prior to the chaotic event popular progressive rock radio station wdai wlsfm had suddenly switched to an alldisco format disenfranchising thousands of chicago rock fans and leaving dahl unemployed on july 21 1979 the top six records on the us music charts were disco songs43 by

in a 2004 interview that disco was probably on its way out but i think it disco demolition night hastened its demise44 impact on music industryedit the antidisco backlash combined with other societal and radio industry factors changed the face of pop radio in the years following disco demolition night starting in the 1980s country music began a slow rise in american main pop charts emblematic of country musics rise to mainstream popularity was the commercially successful 1980 movie urban cowboy somewhat ironically the star of the film was john travolta who only three years before had starred in saturday night fever a film that featured disco culture during this period of decline in discos popularity several record companies folded were reorganized or were sold in 1979 mca records purchased abc records absorbed some of its artists and then shut the label down rso records founder robert stigwood left the label in 1981 and tk records closed in the same year salsoul records continues to exist in the 2000s but primarily is used as a reissue brand45 casablanca records had been releasing fewer records in the 1980s and was shut down in 1986 by parent company polygram many groups that were popular during the disco period subsequently struggled to maintain their success—even those that tried to adapt to evolving musical tastes the bee gees for instance had only one top10 hit 1989s one and three more top40 hits despite recording and releasing far more than that and completely abandoning disco in their 1980s and 1990s songs in the united states after the 1970s even

particular—stand out in spite of having helped define the disco sound early on46 they continued to make popular and danceable if more refined songs for yet another generation of music fans in the 1980s and beyond earth wind fire also survived the disco backlash and continued to produce hits at roughly the same pace for several more years in addition to an even longer string of rb chart hits that lasted into the 1990s factors contributing to discos declineedit the village people group were created to target discos gay audience by featuring popular gay fantasy personae47 for example one of the performers is dressed as a black leatherclad leatherman factors that have been cited as leading to the decline of disco in the united states include economic and political changes at the end of the 1970s as well as burnout from the hedonistic lifestyles led by participants48 in the years since disco demolition night some social critics have described the backlash as implicitly macho and bigoted and an attack on nonwhite and nonheterosexual cultures333742 the backlash also made its way into us politics with the election of conservative ronald reagan in 1980 which also lead to republican control of the united states senate for the first time since 1954 plus the subsequent rise of the religious right around the same time in january 1979 rock critic robert christgau argued that homophobia and most likely racism were reasons behind the backlash36 a conclusion seconded by john rockwell craig werner wrote the antidisco movement represented an unholy alliance of funkateers and feminists progressives and puritans rockers and reactionaries nonetheless the attacks on disco gave respectable voice to the ugliest kinds of unacknowledged racism sexism and homophobia49 legs mcneil founder of the fanzine punk was quoted in an interview as saying the hippies always wanted to be black we were going fk the blues fk the black experience he also said that disco was the result of an unholy union between homosexuals and blacks50 steve dahl who had spearheaded disco demolition night denied any racist or homophobic undertones to the promotion saying its really easy to look at it historically from this perspective and attach all those things to it but we werent thinking like that37 it has been noted that british punk rock critics of disco were very supportive of the problackantiracist reggae genre as well as the more progay new romantics movement33 christgau and jim testa have said that there were legitimate artistic reasons for being critical of disco3640 in 1979 the music industry in the united states underwent its worst slump in decades and disco despite its mass popularity was blamed the produceroriented sound was having difficulty mixing well with the industrys artistoriented marketing system51 harold childs senior vice president at am records told the los angeles times that radio is really desperate for rock product and theyre all looking for some white rocknroll42 gloria gaynor argued that the music industry supported the destruction of disco because rock music producers were losing money and rock musicians were losing the spotlight52 however disco music remained relatively successful in the early 1980s with big hits like irene caras flashdance what a feeling michael jacksons thriller kc and the sunshine bands last major hit give it up and madonnas first album had strong disco influences record producer giorgio moroders soundtracks to american gigolo flashdance and scarface which also had a heavy disco influence proved that the style was still very much embraced queens 1982 album hot space was inspired by the genre as well in the 1990s disco and its legacy became more accepted by music artists and listeners alike as more songs and

guitar and vocals in disco music problems playing these files see media help the music typically layered soaring oftenreverberated vocals often doubled by horns over a background pad of electric pianos and chickenscratch rhythm guitars played on an electric guitar the chicken scratch sound is achieved by lightly pressing the strings against the fretboard and then quickly releasing them just enough to get a slightly muted scratching sound while constantly strumming very close to the bridge68 other backing keyboard instruments include the piano electric organ during early years string synth and electromechanical keyboards such as the fender rhodes electric piano wurlitzer electric piano and hohner clavinet synthesizers are also fairly common in disco especially in the late 1970s the rhythm is laid down by prominent syncopated basslines with heavy use of broken octaves that is octaves with the notes sounded one after the other played on the bass guitar and by drummers using a drum kit africanlatin percussion and electronic drums such as simmons and roland drum modules the sound was enriched with solo lines and harmony parts played by a variety of orchestral instruments such as harp violin viola cello trumpet saxophone trombone clarinet flugelhorn french horn tuba english horn oboe flute sometimes especially the alto flute and occasionally bass flute piccolo timpani and synth strings string section or a full string orchestra most disco songs have a steady fouronthefloor beat a quaver or semiquaver hihat pattern with an open hihat on the offbeat and a heavy syncopated bass line other latin rhythms such as the rhumba the samba and the chachacha are also found in disco recordings and latin polyrhythms such as a rhumba beat layered over a merengue are commonplace the quaver pattern is often supported by other instruments such as the rhythm guitar and may be implied rather than explicitly present songs often use syncopation which is the accenting of unexpected beats in general the difference between a disco or any dance song and a rock or popular song is that in dance music the bass drum hits four to the floor at least once a beat which in 44 time is 4 beats per measure whereas in rock the bass hits on one and three and lets the snare take the lead on two and four the backbeat disco is further characterized by a 16th note division of the quarter notes as shown in the second drum pattern below after a typical rock drum pattern the orchestral sound usually known as disco sound relies heavily on string sections and horns playing linear phrases in unison with the soaring often reverberated vocals or playing instrumental fills while electric pianos and chickenscratch guitars create the background pad sound defining the harmony progression typically all of the doubling of parts and use of additional instruments creates a rich wall of sound there are however more minimalistic flavors of disco with reduced transparent instrumentation pioneered by chic in 1977 giorgio moroder again became responsible for a development in disco alongside donna summer and pete bellotte he wrote the song i feel love for summer to perform it became the first wellknown disco hit to have a completely synthesised backing track the song is still considered to have been well ahead of its time other disco producers most famously tom moulton grabbed ideas and techniques from dub music which came with the increased jamaican migration to new york city in the 1970s to provide alternatives to the four on the floor style that dominated dj larry levan utilized styles from dub and jazz and remixing techniques to create early versions of house music that sparked the genre69 productionedit the disco sound was much more costly to produce than many of the other popular music genres from the 1970s unlike the simpler fourpiece band sound of the funk soul of the late 1960s or the small jazz organ trios disco music often included a large pop band with several chordal instruments guitar keyboards synthesizer several drum or percussion instruments drumkit latin percussion electronic drums a horn section a string orchestra and a variety of classical solo instruments for example flute piccolo and so on disco songs were arranged and composed by experienced arrangers and orchestrators and record producers added their creative touches to the overall sound using multitrack recording techniques and effects units recording complex arrangements with such a large number of instruments and sections required a team that included a conductor copyists record producers and mixing engineers mixing engineers had an important role in the disco production process because disco songs used as many as 64 tracks of vocals and instruments mixing engineers and record producers under the direction of arrangers compiled these tracks into a fluid composition of verses bridges and refrains complete with orchestral builds and breaks mixing engineers and record producers helped to develop the disco sound by creating a distinctivesounding sophisticated disco mix early records were the standard 3 minute version until tom moulton came up with a way to make songs longer moulton wanted to make longer songs so that he could take a crowd of dancers at a club to another level and keep them dancing longer he found that was impossible to make the 45rpm vinyl discs of the time longer as they could usually hold no more than 5 minutes of goodquality music with the help of josé rodriguez his remasterermastering engineer he pressed a single on a 10 disc instead of 7 they cut the next single on a 12 disc the same format as a standard album moulton and rodriguez discovered that these larger records could have much longer songs and remixes twelveinch records even for singles fast became the standard format for all djs of the disco genre70 because record sales were often dependent on dance floor play by djs in leading nightclubs djs were also important to the development and popularization of disco music by selecting and playing disco songs djs helped to make certain songs more or less popular notable disco djs include the first female disco dj in the us karen mixon cook and many other djs such as jim burgess walter gibbons john jellybean benitez richie kaczar of studio 54 rick gianatos francis grasso of sanctuary larry levan ian levine and david mancuso djs not only played songs in clubs they also remixed looped and livemixed these songs from the dj booth changing the ways songs sounded for example a dj might use the intro or bassline from a popular disco track and beatmatch and layer the vocals from a second song over top as well some djs were also record producers who created and produced disco songs in the recording studio larry levan for example is as well known for his prolific record producer work as for his contributions as a dj disco clubs and cultureedit see also circuit parties blue disco quad roller skates by the late 1970s most major us cities had thriving disco club scenes but the largest scenes were in san francisco miami and most notably new york city the scene was centered on discotheques nightclubs and private loft parties where djs would play disco hits from discs and records through pa systems for the patrons who came to dance powerful bassheavy hifi sound systems were viewed as a key part of the disco club experience mancuso introduced the technologies of tweeter arrays clusters of small loudspeakers which emit highend frequencies positioned above the floor and bass reinforcements additional sets of subwoofers positioned at ground level at the start of the 1970s in order to boost the treble and bass at opportune moments and by the end of the decade sound engineers such as richard long had multiplied the effects of these innovations in venues such as the garage12 the djs played  a smooth mix of long single records to keep people dancing all night long71 some of the most prestigious clubs had elaborate lighting systems that throbbed to the beat of the music in the 1970s notable discos included artemis in philadelphia studio one in los angeles leviticus in new york dugans bistro in chicago and the library in atlanta7273 in the late 70s studio 54 in new york city was arguably the most well known nightclub in the world this club played a major formative role in the growth of disco music and nightclub culture in general the copacabana another new york nightclub dating to the 1940s had a revival in the late 1970s when it embraced disco it would become the setting of a barry manilow hit song of the same name disco dancingedit disco dancers typically wore loose slacks for men and flowing dresses for women which enabled ease of movement on the dance floor in the early years dancers in discos danced in a hang loose or freestyle approach at first many dancers improvised their own dance styles and dance steps later in the disco era popular dance styles were developed including the bump penguin boogaloo watergate and the robot by october 1975 the hustle reigned it was highly stylized sophisticated and overtly sexual variations included the brooklyn hustle new york hustle and latin hustle73 during the disco era many nightclubs would commonly host disco dance competitions or offer free dance lessons some cities had disco dance instructors or dance schools which taught people how to do popular disco dances such as touch dancing the hustle and the cha cha the pioneer of disco dance instruction was karen lustgarten in san francisco in 1973 her book the complete guide to disco dancing warner books 1978 was the first to name break down and codify popular disco dances as dance forms and distinguish between disco freestyle partner and line dances the book hit the new york times bestseller list for 13 weeks and was translated into chinese german and french in chicago the step by step disco dance tv show was launched with the sponsorship support of the cocacola company produced in the same studio that don cornelius used for the nationally syndicated dancemusic television show soul train step by steps audience grew and the show became a success the dynamic dance duo of robin and reggie led the show the pair spent the week teaching disco dancing to dancers in the disco clubs the instructional show which aired on saturday mornings had a following of dancers who would stay up all night on fridays so they could be on the set the next morning ready to return to the disco on saturday night knowing with the latest personalized dance steps the producers of the show john reid and greg roselli routinely made appearances at disco functions with robin and reggie to scout out new dancing talent and promote upcoming events such as disco night at white sox park some notable professional dance troupes of the 1970s included pans people and hot gossip for many dancers a key source of inspiration for 1970s disco dancing was the film saturday night fever 1977 this developed into the music and dance style of such films as fame 1980 disco dancer 1982 flashdance 1983 and the last days of disco 1998 interest in disco dancing also helped spawn dance competition tv shows such as dance fever 1979 disco fashionedit disco fashions were very trendy in the late 1970s discothèquegoers often wore glamorous expensive and extravagant fashions for nights out at their local disco club some women would wear sheer flowing dresses such as halston dresses or loose flared pants other women wore tight revealing sexy clothes such as backless halter tops hot pants or bodyhugging spandex bodywear or catsuits74 men would wear shiny polyester qiana shirts with colourful patterns and pointy extra wide collars preferably open at the chest men often wore pierre cardin suits three piece suits with a vest and doubleknit polyester shirt jackets with matching trousers known as the leisure suit mens leisure suits were typically formfitted in some parts of the body such as the waist and bottom but the lower part of the pants were flared in a bell bottom style to permit freedom of movement74 during the disco era men engaged in elaborate grooming rituals and spent time choosing fashion clothing both activities that would have been considered feminine according to the gender stereotypes of the era74 women dancers wore glitter makeup sequins or gold lamé clothing that would shimmer under the lights74 bold colours were popular for both genders platform shoes and boots for both genders and high heels for women were popular footwear74 necklaces and medallions were a common fashion accessory less commonly some disco dancers wore outlandish costumes dressed in drag covered their bodies with gold or silver paint or wore very skimpy outfits leaving them nearly nude these uncommon getups were more likely to be seen at invitationonly new york city loft parties and disco clubs74 drug subculture and sexual promiscuityedit cocaine is a white powder that is typically used by insufflation into the nasal cavity a selection of poppers which are small bottles of the intoxicative inhalant amyl nitrite quaaludes were so commonly used at discos that the drug was nicknamed disco biscuits while the psychedelic hallucinogen lsd is mostly associated with 1960s hippie counterculture it was also used at discos in addition to the dance and fashion aspects of the disco club scene there was also a thriving club drug subculture particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud bassheavy music and the flashing coloured lights such as cocaine75 nicknamed blow amyl nitrite poppers76 and the  other quintessential 1970s club drug quaalude which suspended motor coordination and gave the sensation that ones arms and legs had turned to jello77 quaaludes were so popular at disco clubs that the drug was nicknamed disco biscuits78 paul gootenberg states that the relationship of cocaine to 1970s disco culture cannot be stressed enough75 during the 1970s the use of cocaine by welltodo celebrities led to its glamorization and to the widely held view that it was a soft drug79 cocaine was also popular because its stimulating effect fueled allnight parties at disco clubs80 lsd marijuana and speed amphetamines were also popular in disco clubs and the use of these drugs contributed to the hedonistic quality of the dance floor experience8182 since disco dances were typically held in liquor licensednightclubs and dance clubs alcoholic drinks were also consumed by dancers some users intentionally combined alcohol with the consumption of other drugs such as quaaludes for a stronger effect according to peter braunstein the massive quantities of drugs ingested in discotheques produced the next cultural phenomenon of the disco era rampant promiscuity and public sex while the dance floor was the central arena of seduction actual sex usually took place in the nether regions of the disco bathroom stalls exit stairwells and so on in other cases the disco became a kind of main course in a hedonists menu for a night out77 at the saint nightclub a high percentage of the gay male dancers and patrons would have sex in the club they typically had unprotected sex because in 1980 hivaids had not yet been identified8384 at the saint dancers would elope to an unmonitored upstairs balcony to engage in sex83 the promiscuity and public sex at discos was part of a broader trend towards exploring a freer sexual expression in the 1970s an era that is also associated with swingers clubs hot tubs and key parties85 famous disco bars included the paradise garage and crisco disco as well as  cocainefilled celeb hangouts such as manhattans studio 54 which was operated by steve rubell and ian schrager studio 54 was notorious for the hedonism that went on within the balconies were known for sexual encounters and drug use was rampant its dance floor was decorated with an image of the man in the moon that included an animated cocaine spoon influence on other musicedit 1982–1990 postdisco and dance edit main articles postdisco and electronic dance music the transition from the late1970s disco styles to the early1980s dance styles was marked primarily by the change from complex arrangements performed by large ensembles of studio session musicians including a horn section and an orchestral string section to a leaner sound in which one or two singers would perform to the accompaniment of synthesizer keyboards and drum machines in addition dance music during the 1981–83 period borrowed elements from blues and jazz creating a style different from the disco of the 1970s this emerging music was still known as disco for a short time as the word had become associated with any kind of dance music played in discothèques examples of early1980s dance sound performers include d train kashif and patrice rushen these changes were influenced by some of the notable rb and jazz musicians of the 1970s such as stevie wonder kashif and herbie hancock who had pioneered onemanbandtype keyboard techniques some of these influences had already begun to emerge during the mid1970s at the height of discos popularity during the first years of the 1980s the disco sound began to be phased out and faster tempos and synthesized effects accompanied by guitar and simplified backgrounds moved dance music toward the funk and pop genres this trend can be seen in singer billy oceans recordings between 1979 and 1981 whereas oceans 1979 song american hearts was backed with an orchestral arrangement played by the los angeles symphony orchestra his 1981 song one of those nights feel like gettin down had a more bare strippeddown sound with no orchestration or symphonic arrangements this drift from the original disco sound is called postdisco in this music scene there are rooted subgenres such as italo disco techno house dancepop boogie and early alternative dance86 during the early 1980s dance music dropped the complicated song structure and orchestration that typified the disco sound tv themesedit during the 1970s many tv theme songs were produced or older themes updated with disco influenced music examples include swat 1975 wonder woman 1975 charlies angels 1976 nbc saturday night at the movies 1976 the love boat 1977 the donahue show 1977 chips 1977 the professionals 1977 threes company 1977 dallas 1978 nbc sports broadcasts 1978 kojak 1977 the hollywood squares 1979 the british science fiction program space 1999 1975 also featured a soundtrack strongly influenced by disco especially in the shows second season dj cultureedit see also list of dj magazines top 100 djs the precise variable pitch control on the technics sl1200 mk2 first sold in 1978 helped djs to develop better beatmatching a crucial skill for creating a seamless transition from one song to another the rising popularity of disco came in tandem with developments in the role of the dj djing developed from the use of multiple record turntables and dj mixers to create a continuous seamless mix of songs with one song transitioning to another with no break in the music to interrupt the dancing the resulting dj mix differed from previous forms of dance music in the 1960s which were oriented towards live performances by musicians this in turn affected the arrangement of dance music since songs in the disco era typically contained beginnings and endings marked by a simple beat or riff that could be easily used to transition to a new song the development of djing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques such as beatmatching a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable
