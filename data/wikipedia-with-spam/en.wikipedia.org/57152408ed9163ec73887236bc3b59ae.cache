areas at this point country music was mainly heard on rural am radio stations the expansion of fm was particularly helpful to country music which migrated to fm from the am band as am became overcome by talk radio the country music stations that stayed on am developed the classic country format for the am audience at the same time beautiful music stations already in rural areas began abandoning the format leading to its effective demise to adopt country music as well this wider availability of country music led to producers seeking to polish their product for a wider audience another force

canadaedit main articles canadian country music canadian country music association and canadian country music hall of fame shania twain in 2011 outside of the united states canada has the largest country music fan and artist base something that is to be expected given the two countries proximity and cultural parallels mainstream country music is culturally ingrained in the prairie provinces the british columbia interior ontario and in atlantic canada107 celtic traditional music developed in atlantic canada in the form of scottish acadian and irish folk music popular amongst irish french and scottish immigrants to canadas atlantic provinces newfoundland nova scotia new brunswick and prince edward island107 like the southern united states and appalachia all four regions are of heavy british isles stock and rural as such the development of traditional music in the maritimes somewhat mirrored the development of country music in the us south and appalachia country and western music never really developed separately in canada however after its introduction to canada following the spread of radio it developed quite quickly out of the atlantic canadian traditional scene while true atlantic canadian traditional music is very celtic or sea shanty in nature even today the lines have often been blurred certain areas often are viewed as embracing one strain or the other more openly for example in newfoundland the traditional music remains unique and irish in nature whereas traditional musicians in other parts of the region may play both genres interchangeably don messers jubilee was a halifax nova scotiabased countryfolk variety television show that was broadcast nationally from 1957 to 1969 in canada it outperformed the ed sullivan show broadcast from the united states and became the toprated television show throughout much of the 1960s don messers jubilee followed a consistent format throughout its years beginning with a tune named goin to the barndance tonight followed by fiddle tunes by messer songs from some of his islanders including singers marg osburne and charlie chamberlain the featured guest performance and a closing hymn it ended with till we meet again the guest performance slot gave national exposure to numerous canadian folk musicians including stompin tom connors and catherine mckinnon some maritime country performers went on to further fame beyond canada hank snow wilf carter also known as montana slim and anne murray are the three most notable the cancellation of the show by the public broadcaster in 1969 caused a nationwide protest including the raising of questions in the parliament of canada the prairie provinces due to their western cowboy and agrarian nature are the true heartland of canadian country music107 while the prairies never developed a traditional music culture anything like the maritimes the folk music of the prairies often reflected the cultural origins of the settlers who were a mix of scottish ukrainian german and others for these reasons polkas and western music were always popular in the region and with the introduction of the radio mainstream country music flourished as the culture of the region is western and frontier in nature the specific genre of country and western is more popular today in the prairies than in any other part of the country no other area of the country embraces all aspects of the culture from twostep dancing to the cowboy dress to rodeos to the music itself like the prairies do the atlantic provinces on the other hand produce far more traditional musicians but they are not usually specifically country in nature usually bordering more on the folk or celtic genres107 many traditional country artists are present in eastern and western canada they make common use of fiddle and pedal steel guitar styles some notable canadian country artists include shania twain anne murray kd lang gordon lightfoot buffy saintemarie george canyon blue rodeo tommy hunter rita macneil stompin tom connors stan rogers ronnie prophet carroll baker the rankin family ian tyson johnny reid paul brandt jason mccoy george fox carolyn dawn johnson hank snow don messer
