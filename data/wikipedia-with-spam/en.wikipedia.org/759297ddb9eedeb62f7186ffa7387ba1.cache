and built by boeing commercial airplanes it is the manufacturers largest singleaisle passenger aircraft and was produced from 1981 to 2004 the twinjet has a twocrew member glass cockpit turbofan engines of sufficient power to allow takeoffs from relatively short runways and higher altitudes a conventional tail and for reduced aerodynamic drag a supercritical wing design intended to replace the smaller threeengine 727 on short and medium routes the 757 can carry 200 to 295 passengers for a maximum of 3150 to 4100 nautical miles 5830 to 7590 km depending on variant the 757 was designed concurrently with a widebody twinjet the 767 and owing to shared features pilots can obtain a common type rating that allows them to operate both aircraft the 757 was produced in two fuselage lengths the original 757200 entered service in 1983 the 757200pf a package freighter pf variant and the 757200m a passengerfreighter combi model debuted in the late 1980s the stretched 757300 the longest narrowbody twinjet ever produced2 began service in 1999 passenger 757200s have been modified to special freighter sf specification for cargo use while military derivatives include the c32 transport vip carriers and other multipurpose aircraft private and government operators have also customized the 757 for research and transport roles all 757s are powered by rollsroyce rb211 or pratt whitney pw2000 series turbofans eastern air lines and british airways placed the 757 in commercial service in 1983 the narrowbody twinjet succeeded earlier singleaisle airliners and became commonly used for short and midrange domestic routes shuttle services and transcontinental us flights after regulators granted approval for extended flights over water etops in 1986 airlines also began using the aircraft for intercontinental routes major customers for the 757 included us mainline carriers european charter airlines and cargo companies the airliner has recorded eight hullloss accidents including seven fatal crashes as of september 2015update3 production of the 757 ended in october 2004 after 1050 had been built for 54 customers the 757200 was by far the most popular model with 913 built diminished sales amid an airline industry trend toward smaller jetliners led boeing to end production without a direct replacement in favor of the 737 family the last 757 was delivered to shanghai airlines in november 2005 in july 2015 689 of the narrowbody twinjets were in airline service delta air lines is the largest operator with 128 aircraft4 contents 1 development 11 background

considering further developments of its narrowbody 727 trijet5 designed for short and medium length routes6 the threeengined 727 was the bestselling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and a mainstay of the us domestic airline market57 studies focused on improving the 189seat 727200 the most successful 727 variant8 two approaches were considered a stretched 727300 and an allnew aircraft codenamed 7n78 the former was a cheaper derivative using the 727s existing technology and tailmounted engine configuration8 while the latter was a twinengine aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry9 the 7n7 made its farnborough airshow debut in 1982 as the 757200 united airlines provided input for the proposed 727300 which boeing was poised to launch in late 19758 but lost interest after examining development studies for the 7n78 although the 727300 was offered to braniff international airways and other carriers customer interest remained insufficient for further development5 instead airlines were drawn to the highbypassratio turbofan engines new flight deck technologies lower weight improved aerodynamics and reduced operating cost promised by the 7n789 these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new midsize widebody airliner codenamed 7x7 which became the 76710 work on both proposals accelerated as a result of the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s511 by 1978 development studies focused on two variants a 7n7100 with seating for 160 and a 7n7200 with room for over 180 seats9 new features included a redesigned wing underwing engines and lighter materials while the forward fuselage cockpit layout and ttail configuration were retained from the 72712 boeing planned for the aircraft to offer the lowest fuel burn per passengerkilometer of any narrowbody airliner13 on august 31 1978 eastern air lines and british airways became the first carriers to publicly commit to the 7n7 when they announced launch orders totaling 40 aircraft for the 7n7200 version913 these orders were signed in march 1979 when boeing officially designated the aircraft as the 7579 the shorter 757100 did not receive any orders and was dropped 737s later fulfilled its envisioned role14 design effort the 757 was intended to be more capable and more efficient than the preceding 72715 the focus on fuel efficiency reflected airline concerns over operating costs which had grown amid rising oil prices during the yom kippur war of 1973916 design targets included a 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption from new engines plus an additional 10 percent from aerodynamic improvements versus preceding aircraft16 lighter materials and new wings were also expected to improve efficiency9 the maximum takeoff weight mtow was set at 220000 pounds 99800 kg17 which was 10000 pounds 4540 kg more than the 72718 the 757s higher powertoweight ratio allowed it to take off from short runways and serve airports in hot and high climates offering better takeoff performance than that offered by competing aircraft competitors needed longer takeoff runs at airports at higher elevations with higher ambient temperatures and thinner air boeing also offered options for higher payload capability1719 forward view of a transavia airlines 757200 showing fuselage profile wing dihedral and rb211 engines the twinengine configuration was chosen for greater fuel efficiency versus three and fourengine designs20 launch customers eastern air lines and british airways selected the rb211535c turbofan built by rollsroyce which was capable of 37400 poundsforce 166 kn of thrust21 this marked the first time that a boeing airliner was launched with engines produced outside the us9 domestic manufacturer pratt whitney subsequently offered the 38200 poundsforce 170 kn thrust pw203721 which delta air lines launched with an order for 60 aircraft in november 1980922 general electric also offered its cf632 engine early in the program but eventually abandoned its involvement due to insufficient demand23 as development progressed the 757 increasingly departed from its 727 origins and adopted elements from the 7679 which was several months ahead in development24 to reduce risk and cost boeing combined design work on both twinjets520 resulting in shared features such as interior fittings and handling characteristics25 computeraided design first applied on the 767 was used for over onethird of the 757s design drawings26 in early 1979 a common twocrew member glass cockpit was adopted for the two aircraft including shared instrumentation avionics and flight management systems25 cathoderay tube crt color displays replaced conventional electromechanical instruments25 with increased automation eliminating the flight engineer position common to threeperson cockpits25 after completing a short conversion course pilots rated on the 757 could be qualified to fly the 767 and vice versa owing to their design similarities25 predecessor and successor an air atlantis 727200 and an air europe 757200 a new aftloaded shape which produced lift across most of the upper wing surface instead of a narrow band as in previous airfoil designs was used for the 757s wings9 the more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity9 and were similar in configuration to those on the 76726 a wider wingspan than the 727s produced less liftinduced drag while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft26 one of the last 727 vestiges the ttail was dropped in mid1979 in favor of a conventional tail9 this avoided the risk of an aerodynamic condition known as a deep stall and allowed for more passengers to be carried in a less tapered rear fuselage27 at 1553 feet 473 m in length28 the 757200 was 21 feet 0640 m longer than the 727200 and with a greater proportion of its internal volume devoted to cabin space seating was available for 239 passengers or 50 more than its predecessor1829 the fuselage crosssection whose upper lobe was common to the 707 and 7373031 was the only major structural feature to be retained from the 72732 this was mainly to reduce drag16 and while a wider fuselage had been considered boeings market research found low cargo capacity needs and reduced passenger preference for widebody aircraft on shorthaul routes1220 production and testing boeing built a final assembly line in washington at its renton factory33 home of 707 727 and 737 production to produce the 75734 early in the development program boeing british airways and rollsroyce unsuccessfully lobbied the british aircraft industry to manufacture 757 wings1335 ultimately about half of the aircrafts components including the wings nose section and empennage were produced inhouse at boeing facilities and the remainder subcontracted to primarily usbased companies36 fairchild aircraft made the leading edge slats grumman supplied the flaps and rockwell international produced the main fuselage36 production rampup for the new narrowbody airliner coincided with the windingdown of the 727 program36 and final assembly of the first aircraft began in january 198121 british airways was one of the first customers for the rb211powered 757 the prototype 757 rolled out of the renton factory on january 13 198237 the aircraft equipped with rb211535c engines37 completed its maiden flight one week ahead of schedule on february 19 198238 the first flight was affected by an engine stall following indications of low oil pressure39 after checking system diagnostics company test pilot john armstrong and copilot lew wallick were able to restart the affected engine and the flight proceeded normally thereafter39 subsequently the 757 embarked on a sevenday weekly flight test schedule40 by this time the aircraft had received 136 orders from seven carriers namely air florida american airlines british airways delta air lines eastern air lines monarch airlines and transbrasil21 the sevenmonth 757 flight test program used the first five aircraft built41 tasks included flight systems and propulsion tests hot and cold weather trials and routeproving flights42 data from the 767 program helped expedite the process40 after design issues were identified the 757s exit doors received dualspring mechanisms for easier operation and the fuselage was strengthened for greater bird strike resistance43 the production aircraft was 3600 pounds 1630 kg lighter than originally specified and recorded a three percent betterthanexpected rate of fuel burn42 this resulted in a range increase of 200 nautical miles 370 km and prompted boeing to tout the aircrafts fuel efficiency characteristics42 after 1380 flight test hours44 the rb211powered 757 received us federal aviation administration faa certification on december 21 1982 followed by uk civil aviation authority caa certification on january 14 19833941 the first delivery to launch customer eastern air lines occurred on december 22 1982 about four months after the first 767 deliveries3945 the first 757 with pw2037 engines rolled out about one year later and was delivered to delta air lines on november 5 198439 service entry and operations eastern air lines began domestic 757 operations in january 1983 and later deployed the aircraft on transcontinental routes eastern air lines operated the first commercial 757 flight on january 1 1983 on the atlantatotampa route39 on february 9 1983 british airways began using the aircraft for londontobelfast shuttle services where it replaced hawker siddeley trident 3b trijets46 charter carriers monarch airlines and air europe also began 757 operations later that year47 early operators noted improved reliability and quieter performance compared with previous jetliners47 transition courses eased pilots introduction to the new crtbased cockpit and no major technical issues arose47 eastern air lines the first 727 operator to take delivery of 757s confirmed that the aircraft had greater payload capability than its predecessor along with lower operating costs through improved fuel burn and the use of a twocrew member flight deck47 compared with the 707 and 727 the new twinjet consumed 42 and 40 percent less fuel per seat respectively on typical mediumhaul flights12 despite the successful debut 757 sales remained stagnant for most of the 1980s a consequence of declining fuel prices and a shift to smaller aircraft in the postderegulation us market39 although no direct competitor existed20 150seat narrowbodies such as the mcdonnell douglas md80 were cheaper to acquire and carried nearly as many passengers as some airlines 757s1739 a threeyear sales drought abated in november 1983 when northwest airlines placed orders for 20 aircraft which averted a costly production rate decrease48 in december 1985 a freighter model the 757200pf was announced following a launch order for 20 aircraft from ups airlines39 and in february 1986 a freighterpassenger combi model the 757200m was launched with an order for one aircraft from royal nepal airlines49 the freighter model included a main deck cargo hold and entered service with ups in september 198750 the combi model could carry both cargo and passengers on its main deck and entered service with royal nepal airlines in september 198849 in the late 1980s increasing airline hub congestion and the onset of us airport noise regulations fueled a turnaround in 757 sales39 from 1988 to 1989 airlines placed 322 orders including a combined 160 orders from american airlines and united airlines3951 by this time the 757 had become commonplace on shorthaul domestic flights and transcontinental services in the us50 and had replaced aging 707s 727s douglas dc8s and mcdonnell douglas dc9s52 the 757200s maximum range of 3900 nautical miles 7220 km28 which was over oneandahalf times the 727s18 allowed airlines to use the aircraft on longer nonstop routes53 the 757 was also flown out of airports with stringent noise regulations such as john wayne airport in orange county california54 and airports with aircraft size restrictions such as washington national airport near downtown washington dc11 the largest us operators delta air lines and american airlines would ultimately operate fleets of over 100 aircraft each50 monarch airlines began 757 charter services in march 1983 in europe british airways iberia and icelandair were the 757s largest mainline customers55 while other carriers such as lufthansa rejected the type as too large for their narrowbody aircraft needs43 many european charter airlines including air 2000 air holland and ltu international45 also acquired the twinjet for holiday and tour package flights in the late 1980s5052 in asia where even larger aircraft were commonly preferred because of greater passenger volumes the 757 found fewer orders56 a 1982 sales demonstration was unable to attract a purchase from potential customer japan airlines4557 and the first asian customer singapore airlines sold its four 757s in 1989 in favor of standardizing on the 240seat widebody airbus a310 just five years after debuting the type on indonesian and malaysian routes58 the 757 fared better in china where following an initial purchase by the civil aviation administration of china caac in 198750 orders grew to 59 aircraft making it the largest asian market45 operators such as china southern china southwest shanghai airlines xiamen airlines and xinjiang airlines used the 757 on medium length domestic routes59 in 1986 the faa approved rb211powered 757s for extendedrange twinengine operational performance standards etops operations over the north atlantic1344 following precedents set by the 76760 under etops regulations a set of safety standards governing twinjet flights over oceans and other areas without nearby suitable landing sites airlines began using the aircraft for midrange intercontinental routes13 although the 757 was not originally intended for transoceanic flights regulators based their decision on its reliable performance record on extended transcontinental us services6061 etops certification for 757s equipped with pw2000 series engines was granted in 199249 in the early 1990s the faa and other us government agencies including the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the national transportation safety board ntsb began studying the 757s wake turbulence characteristics62 this followed several incidents including two fatal crashes in which small private aircraft experienced loss of control when flying close behind the twinjet62 smaller airliners had also suffered unexpected rolling movements when flying behind 757s62 investigators focused on the aircrafts aftloaded wing design which at certain points during takeoff or landing could produce wingtip vortices that were stronger than those emanating from larger 767s and 747s63 other tests were inconclusive leading to debate among government agencies and in 1994 and 1996 the faa updated air traffic control regulations to require greater separation behind the 757 than other largecategory jets6264 the 757 became the only sub300000pound 136000 kg airliner to be classified as a heavy jet alongside widebody aircraft under faa separation rules63 stretched variant production of the 757 peaked at an annual rate of 100 aircraft in the early 1990s65 during which time upgraded models came under consideration14 for over a decade the narrowbody twinjet had been its manufacturers only singleaisle airliner without a stretched variant and while rumors of a longrange 757200x and stretched 757300x persisted no formal announcements had been made14 european charter carriers were particularly interested in a highercapacity version which could take better advantage of the 757s range50 besides meeting the needs of charter customers a larger model would enable boeing to match the passenger lift capabilities of the 767200 with lower operating costs66 and counter longerrange versions of the 185seat airbus a32167 a new stretched variant of the a320 narrowbody airliner5068 condor became the first operator of the stretched 757300 in march 1999 in september 1996 following a launch order for 12 aircraft from charter carrier condor boeing announced the stretched 757300 at the farnborough airshow14 the new model was a 234foot 713 m stretch of the 757200 resulting in room for 50 more passengers and nearly 50 percent more cargo229 the types design phase was intended to be the shortest in its manufacturers history with 27 months from launch to certification14 due to development and cost concerns radical upgrades such as a next generation 737style advanced cockpit were not implemented69 instead the stretched derivative received upgraded engines enhanced avionics and a redesigned interior4969 the first 757300 rolled out on may 31 1998 and completed its maiden flight on august 2 199850 following regulatory certification in january 1999 the type entered service with condor on march 19 199950 the 757300 was also ordered by american trans air arkia israel airlines continental airlines icelandair and northwest airlines45 sales for the type remained slow and ultimately totaled 55 aircraft50 boeing had targeted the 757300 as a potential 767200 replacement for two of its largest customers american airlines and united airlines but neither were in a financial position to commit to new aircraft70 overtures to other charter airlines also did not result in further orders71 by november 1999 faced with diminishing sales and a reduced backlog despite the launch of the 757300 boeing began studying a decrease in 757 production rates72 further developments while the 757 program had been financially successful declining sales in the early 2000s threatened its continued viability7273 airlines were again gravitating toward smaller aircraft now mainly the 737 and a320 because of their reduced financial risk74 an airline industry downturn and the large number of relatively young 757s already in service also reduced customer demand73 in 2000 spurred by interest from air 2000 and continental airlines boeing reexamined the possibility of building a longerrange 757200x75 the proposed derivative would have featured auxiliary fuel tanks plus wing and landing gear upgrades from the 757300 resulting in a higher mtow and a potential range increase to over 5000 nautical miles 9260 km75 however the proposal failed to garner any orders4571 in march 2001 boeing delivered the first 757200sf a secondhand 757200 converted for freighter use to dhl aviation76 the 757200sf marked the manufacturers first foray into passengertofreighter conversions77 shanghai airlines received the last production 757 b2876 in november 2005 customer interest in new 757s continued to decline and in 2003 a renewed sales campaign centered on the 757300 and 757200pf yielded only five new orders71 in october 2003 following continental airlines decision to switch its remaining 757300 orders to the 737800 boeing announced the end of 757 production71 the 1050th and last example a 757200 built for shanghai airlines rolled off the production line at the renton factory on october 28 20041 and was delivered on november 28 2005 after several months of storage787879 with the conclusion of the 757 program boeing consolidated 737 assembly at its renton factory downsizing its facilities by 40 percent and shifting staff to different locations80 since the end of production most 757s have remained in service mainly in the us5081 from 2004 to 2008 the average fuel cost for typical midrange us domestic 757 flights tripled putting pressure on airlines to improve the fuel efficiency of their fleets82 in may 2005 the faa granted regulatory approval for manufacturersanctioned blended winglets from aviation partners incorporated as a retrofit on the 75720083 the winglets improve fuel efficiency by five percent and increase range by 200 nautical miles 370 km through the reduction of liftinduced drag8485 continental airlines was the first carrier to order winglets for the 757200 and in february 2009 became the first operator of 757300s with winglets86 continental airlines 757300 with blended winglets which reduce liftinduced drag and improve fuel efficiency prior to the unitedcontinental merger in 2010 the 757 remained the only narrowbody aircraft in use by the large fleets of all three us legacy carriers american airlines delta air lines and united airlines6887 during this period the 757s capacity and range capabilities have remained largely unequaled among narrowbody airliners88 when selecting replacement aircraft airlines have had to either downsize to smaller singleaisle aircraft in production with fewer seats and less range such as the 737900er and a321 or upsize to the larger longerrange 787 dreamliner and a330200 widebody jets6889 the tupolev tu204 a narrowbody twinjet introduced in 1989 with a design similar to the 757s90 is offered in a 200seat version which has seen limited production for mainly russian customers9192 within boeing the 215seat 3200nauticalmile 5930 km range 737900er has been regarded as the closest aircraft in production to the 75720093 replacement aircraft main article middle of the market in february 2015 boeing marketing vice president randy tinseth stated reengining the 757 had been studied but there was no business case to support it94 at the march 2015 international society of transport aircraft traders conference air lease corporations steven udvarhazy predicted the 757 replacement as a more capable cleansheet 767like twinaisle airplane capable of taking off 7000 feet 2130 m runways like new york laguardia and tinseth is focused on 20 more range and more capacity than the 75720095 design overview birds eye view of ethiopian airlines 757200 etamk at london heathrow airport the 757 is a lowwing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit featuring a single fin and rudder each wing features a supercritical crosssection and is equipped with fivepanel leading edge slats single and doubleslotted flaps an outboard aileron and six spoilers96 the wings are largely identical across all 757 variants swept at 25 degrees and optimized for a cruising speed of mach 08 533 mph or 858 kmh2629 the reduced wing sweep eliminates the need for inboard ailerons yet incurs little drag penalty on short and medium length routes during which most of the flight is spent climbing or descending97 the airframe further incorporates carbonfiber reinforced plastic wing surfaces kevlar fairings and access panels plus improved aluminum alloys which together reduce overall weight by 2100 pounds 950 kg2198 to distribute the aircrafts weight on the ground the 757 has a retractable tricycle landing gear with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear99 the landing gear was purposely designed to be taller than the companys previous narrowbody aircraft in order to provide ground clearance for stretched models100 in 1982 the 757200 became the first subsonic jetliner to offer carbon brakes as a factory option supplied by dunlop101 the stretched 757300 features a retractable tailskid on its aft fuselage to prevent damage if the tail section contacts the runway surface during takeoff102 besides common avionics and computer systems the 757 shares its auxiliary power unit electric power systems flight deck and hydraulic parts with the 767103 through operational commonality 757 pilots can obtain a common type rating to fly the 767 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft25104 this reduces costs for airlines that operate both twinjets2044 flight systems twocrew cockpit of an american airlines 757200 with crt displays the 757s flight deck uses six rockwell collins crt screens to display flight instrumentation as well as an electronic flight instrument system efis and an engine indication and crew alerting system eicas25 these systems allow the pilots to handle monitoring tasks previously performed by the flight engineer25 an enhanced flight management system improved over versions used on early 747s automates navigation and other functions25 while an automatic landing system facilitates cat iiib instrument landings in 490 feet 150 m low visibility conditions105 the inertial reference system irs which debuted with the 757200 was the first to feature laserlight gyros37 on the 757300 the upgraded flight deck features a honeywell pegasus flight management computer enhanced eicas and updated software systems2 to accommodate the same flight deck design as the 767 the 757 has a more rounded nose section than previous narrowbody aircraft15106 the resulting space has unobstructed panel visibility and room for an observer seat107 similar pilot viewing angles as the 767 result from a downward sloped cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows43107 three independent hydraulic systems are installed on the 757 one powered by each engine and the third using electric pumps2199 a ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls in the event of an emergency99 a basic form of flybywire facilitates spoiler operation utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables36 the flybywire system shared with the 76736 reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers108 when equipped for extendedrange operations the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircrafts electronics bay44 interior ethiopian airlines 757200 economy cabin in 33 layout the 757 interior allows seat arrangements of up to six per row with a single center aisle37 originally optimized for flights averaging two hours20 the 757 features interior lighting and cabin architecture designs aimed at a more spacious impression34 as on the 767 garmentbaglength overhead bins and a rear economyclass galley are standard equipment109 the bins have twice the capacity as those on the preceding 72734 to save weight honeycomb sandwich is used for interior paneling and bins34 unlike previous evacuation slide designs which are not equipped for water landings the 757s main exits feature combination slide rafts similar to those found on the 74734 in the 1980s boeing altered the interior designs of its other narrowbody aircraft to be similar to that of the 757110 in 1998 the 757300 debuted a redesigned interior derived from the next generation 737 and 777 including sculptured ceiling panels indirect lighting and larger overhead bins with an optional continuous handrail built into their base for the entire cabin length111 centerline storage containers mounted in the aisle ceiling for additional escape rafts and other emergency equipment were also added112 the 757300s interior later became an option on all new 757200s113 in 2000 with wheeled carryon baggage becoming more popular delta air lines began installing overhead bin extensions on their 757200s to provide additional storage space114 and american airlines did the same in 2001115 the larger bins are part of aftermarket interior upgrades which include updated ceiling panels and lighting116117 variants a united airlines 757200 on final approach viewed from below with extended landing gear flaps and slats the 757 was produced in standard and stretched lengths118 the original 757200 debuted as a passenger model and was subsequently developed into the 757200pf and 757200sf cargo models77 as well as the convertible 757200m variant118 the stretched 757300 was only available as a passenger model119 when referring to different versions boeing and airlines are known to collapse the model number 757 and the variant designator eg 200 or 300 into a truncated form eg 752 or 753120 the international civil aviation organization icao classifies all variants based on the 757200 under the code b752 and the 757300 is referred to as b753 for air traffic control purposes121 757200 us airways 757200 in 2007 the 757200 the original version of the aircraft entered service with eastern air lines in 198339 the type was produced with two different door configurations both with three standard cabin doors per side the baseline version has a fourth smaller cabin door on each side aft of the wings and is certified for a maximum capacity of 239 while the alternate version has a pair of overthewing emergency exits on each side and can seat a maximum of 22429122 the 757200 was offered with a mtow of up to 255000 pounds 116000 kg28 some airlines and publications have referred to higher gross weight versions with etops certification as 757200ers118123124 but this designation is not used by the manufacturer2945 similarly versions with winglets are sometimes called 757200w or 757200wl3125 the first engine to power the 757200 the rollsroyce rb211535c was succeeded by the upgraded rb211535e4 in october 1984126 other engines used include the rb211535e4b along with the pratt whitney pw2037 and pw204028 its range with full payload is 3850 nautical miles 7130 km127 although designed for short and medium length routes the 757200 has since been used in a variety of roles ranging from highfrequency shuttle services to transatlantic routes50 in 1992 after gaining etops approval american trans air launched 757200 transpacific services between tucson and honolulu49 since the turn of the century mainline us carriers have increasingly deployed the type on transatlantic routes to europe and particularly to smaller cities where passenger volumes are insufficient for widebody aircraft128 production for the 757200 totaled 913 aircraft making the type by far the most popular 757 model45 at over 4000 nautical miles 7410 km as of february 2015update the longest commercial route served by a 757 is united airlines new york to berlin flight the aircraft assigned to this route cannot fly with

rollsroyce and the pw2043 from pratt whitney144145 due to its greater length the 757300 features a retractable tailskid on its aft fuselage to avoid tailstrikes102146 condor ordered the stretched 757 to replace its mcdonnell douglas dc10s and serve as lowcost highdensity transportation to holiday destinations such as the canary islands147 because tests showed that boarding the 757300 could take up to eight minutes longer than the 757200111 boeing and condor developed zonebased boarding procedures to expedite loading and unloading times for the lengthened aircraft111 the 757300 has been operated by mainline carriers continental airlines now part of united airlines northwest airlines now part of delta air lines and icelandair other operators have included american trans air the first north american operator148 arkia israel airlines along with charter carriers condor and thomas cook airlines87 production for the 757300 totaled 55 aircraft45 all 55 were in service in july 20174 government military and corporate government military and private customers have acquired the 757 for uses ranging from aeronautical testing and research to cargo and vip transport the 757200 the most widely ordered version of the aircraft45 has formed the basis for these applications the first government operator of the 757 was the mexican air force which took delivery of a vipconfigured 757200 in november 1987149 airborne research integrated experiments system – aries a nasa platform for air safety and operational research was created in 1999 using the second production 757150 the aircraft originally flew in the 757 flight test program before entering service with eastern air lines150 after nasa purchased the aircraft in 1994 to replace its 737100 testbed55150 it was initially used to evaluate a hybrid laminar flow control system avionics systems for the proposed northrop yf23 jet fighter and the 777s flybywire control system55 equipped with a flight deck research station onboard laboratories and two experimental flight decks150 aries was used for evaluating weather information and landing approach systems as well as runway friction tests150 aries went into storage in 2006151 the c32a a variant of the 757 is the usual air transportation for the vice president of the united states c32 – the united states air force usaf operates four vipconfigured 757200s under the designation c32a for missions including transporting the vice president of the united states under the callsign air force two152 the c32as are outfitted with a communication center conference room seating area and private living quarters152 the usaf also operates two 45seat 757200 aircraft designated c32b for use by the us state department foreign emergency support team55153 the c32as feature the blueandwhite paint scheme used by the usaf for its vip transport fleet152 while the c32bs are painted in solid white with minimal identification markings154 the first c32s were delivered in 1998 and replaced c137 stratoliner transports55 f22 flying testbed – the first 757 built was used in 1998 as a testbed for lockheed martin f22 raptor avionics and sensor integration155 the boeingowned aircraft was fitted with a canard above its cockpit to simulate the jet fighters wing sensor layout along with a forward f22 fuselage section with radar and other systems and a 30seat laboratory with communication electronic warfare identification and navigation sensors155156 krueger flap and natural laminar flow insect mitigation test program – boeing commenced a series of test flights on 17 march 2015 with a modified boeing 757 incorporating new wingleadingedge sections and an actively blown vertical tail157 the left wing has been modified to include a 67 mspan glove section supporting a variablecamber krueger flap which will be deployed during landing and which protrudes just ahead of the leading edge although krueger flaps have been tried before as insectmitigation screens previous designs caused additional drag the newer design being tested is variablecamber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the lower wing surface increasing the use of natural laminar flow nlf on an aircraft wing has the potential to improve fuel burn by as much as 15 but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from laminar to turbulent destroying the performance benefit the test flights have been supported by the european airline group tui ag and conducted jointly with nasa as part of the agency’s environmentally responsible aviation era program while the left wing tests the kreuger flaps the right wing is being used to test coatings that prevent insects from adhering to the wing success here will open the door to the application of natural laminar flow to reduce fuel burn158 active flow control system – boeing has mounted 31 active flow jets mounted ahead of the rudders leading edge they receive air from the auxiliary power unit apu their purpose is to recover air flow that has separated from the rudder and redirect it to the rudder so that the rudder regains effectiveness even at high deflection angles the air exiting the apu is very hot at 380 °f 193 °c and is cooled by a heat exchanger mounted under the aft fuselage which is connected to the ducts running along the front and back of the stabilizers spars this ensures an even air supply at all times159 in 2009 the royal new zealand air force flew one of its 757 combis to antarctica for the first time royal new zealand air force 757 combi – the royal new zealand air force rnzaf
