bill cole and gardiner turned the paper over to the mirror company in the meantime s j mathes had joined the firm and it was at his insistence that the times continued publication in july 1882 harrison gray otis moved from santa barbara to become the papers editor4 otis made the times a financial success historian kevin starr wrote that otis was a businessman capable of manipulating the entire apparatus of politics and public opinion for his own enrichment5 otiss editorial policy was based on civic boosterism extolling the virtues of los angeles and promoting its growth toward those ends the paper supported efforts to expand the citys water supply by acquiring the rights to the water supply of the distant owens valley rubble of the la times building after the 1910 bombing the

forgotten in the power centers of the northeastern united states due to its geographic and cultural distance he sought to remake the paper in the model of the nations most respected newspapers notably the new york times and the washington post believing that the newsroom was the heartbeat of the business8 otis chandler increased the size and pay of the reporting staff and expanded its national and international reporting in 1962 the paper joined with the washington post to form the los angeles times–washington post news service to syndicate articles from both papers for other news organizations during the 1960s the paper won four pulitzer prizes more than its previous nine decades combined writing in 2013 about the pattern of newspaper ownership by founding families times reporter michael hiltzik said that the first generations bought or founded their local paper for profits and also social and political influence which often brought more profits their children enjoyed both profits and influence but as the families grew larger the later generations found that only one or two branches got the power and everyone else got a share of the money eventually the couponclipping branches realized that they could make more money investing in something other than newspapers under their pressure the companies went public or split apart or disappeared thats the pattern followed over more than a century by the los angeles times under the chandler family9 the papers early history and subsequent transformation was chronicled in an unauthorized history thinking big 1977 isbn 0399117660

other company assets zell announced that he would sell the chicago cubs baseball club he put up for sale the companys 25 percent interest in comcast sportsnet chicago until shareholder approval was received los angeles billionaires ron burkle and eli broad had the right to submit a higher bid in which case zell would have received a 25 million buyout fee13 in december 2008 the tribune company filed for bankruptcy protection the bankruptcy was a result of declining advertising revenue and a debt load of 129 billion much of it incurred when the paper was taken private by zell14 editorial changes and staff reductionsedit john carroll former editor of the baltimore sun was brought in to restore the luster of the newspaper during his reign at the times he eliminated more than 200 jobs but despite an operating profit margin of 20 percent the tribune executives were unsatisfied with returns and by 2005 carroll had left the newspaper his successor dean baquet refused to impose the additional cutbacks mandated by the tribune company baquet was the first africanamerican to hold this type of editorial position at a toptier daily during baquet and carrolls time at the paper it won 13 pulitzer prizes more than any other paper but the new york times15 however baquet was removed from the editorship for not meeting the demands of the tribune group—as was publisher jeffrey johnson—and was replaced by james oshea of the chicago tribune oshea himself left in january 2008 after a budget dispute with publisher david hiller the papers content and design style was overhauled several times in attempts to increase circulation in 2000 a major change reorganized the news sections related news was put closer together and changed the local section to the california section with more extensive coverage another major change in 2005 saw the sunday opinion section retitled the sunday current section with a radical change in its presentation and featured columnists there were

reduce the number of published pages by 15 percent1617 that included about 17 percent of the news staff as part of the newly private media companys mandate to reduce costs weve tried to get ahead of all the change thats occurring in the business and get to an organization and size that will be sustainable hiller saidcitation needed the changes and cuts were controversial prompting criticism from such disparate sources as a jewish journal commentary an anonymously written employee blog called tell zell and a satirical web site not the la times in january 2009 the times increased its singlecopy price from 50 to 75 cents18 and eliminated the separate californiametro section folding it into the front section of the newspaper the times also announced seventy job cuts in news and editorial or a

october 5 2015 poynter institute reported that at least 50 editorial positions will be culled from the los angeles times through a buyout22 on this subject the los angeles times reported with foresight for the funemployed unemployment is welcome23 nancy cleeland24 who took osheas buyout offer did so because of frustration with the papers coverage of working people and organized labor25 the beat that earned her pulitzer24 she speculated that the papers revenue shortfall could be reversed by expanding coverage of economic justice topics which she believed were increasingly relevant to southern california she cited the papers attempted hiring of a celebrity justice reporter as an example of the wrong approach25 on august 21 2017 ross levinsohn then aged 54 was named publisher and ceo replacing davan maharaj who had been both publisher and editor26 circulationedit the timess reported daily circulation in october 2010 was 60044927 down from a peak of 1225189 daily and 1514096 sunday in april 19902829 some attributed the drop in circulation to the increasing availability of alternate methods of obtaining news such as the internet cable tv and radiocitation needed others believed that the drop was due to the retirement of circulation director bert tiffany still others thought the decline was a side effect of a succession of shortlived editors who were appointed by publisher mark willes after publisher otis chandler relinquished daytoday control in 19958 willes the former president of general mills was criticized for his lack of understanding of the newspaper business and was derisively referred to by reporters and editors as the cereal killer30 abandoned los angeles times vending machine covina ca 2011 other reasons offered for the circulation drop included an increase in the singlecopy price from 25 cents to 50 cents31 and a rise in the proportion of readers preferring to read the online version instead of the print version32 editor jim oshea in an internal memo announcing a may 2007 mostly voluntary reduction in force characterized the decrease in circulation as an industrywide problem which the paper had to counter by growing rapidly online breaking news on the web and explaining and analyzing it in our newspaper33 in early 2006 the times closed its san fernando valley printing plant leaving press operations to the olympic plant and to orange county also in 2006 the times announced its circulation had fallen to 851532 down 54 percent from 2005 the timess loss of circulation was the largest of the top ten newspapers in the us34 despite the circulation decline many in the media industry lauded the newspapers effort to decrease its reliance on otherpaid circulation in favor of building its individually paid circulation base—which showed a marginal increase in a circulation audit this distinction reflected the difference between for example copies distributed to hotel guests free of charge otherpaid versus subscriptions and singlecopy sales individually paidcitation needed internet presence and free weekliesedit in december 2006 a team of times reporters delivered management with a critique of the papers online news efforts known as the spring street project35 the report which condemned the times as a webstupid organization35 was followed by a shakeup in management of the papers website36

point of view42 the los angeles times building michael kinsley was hired as the opinion and editorial oped editor in april 2004 to help improve the quality of the opinion pieces his role was
