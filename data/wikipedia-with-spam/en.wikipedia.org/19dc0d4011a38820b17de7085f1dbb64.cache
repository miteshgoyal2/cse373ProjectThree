history of seattle before 1900 from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search history of seattle before white settlement 1851–1900 1900–1940 since 1940 timeline v t e two conflicting perspectives exist for the early history of seattle there is the establishment view which favors the centrality of the denny party generally the denny mercer terry and boren families and henry yesler a second less didactic view advanced particularly by historian bill speidel and others such as murray morgan sees david swinson doc maynard as a key figure perhaps the key figure in the late nineteenth century when seattle had become a thriving town several members of the denny party still survived they and many of their descendants were in local positions of power and influence maynard was about ten years older and died relatively young so he was not around to make his own case the denny party were generally conservative methodists teetotalers whigs and republicans while maynard was a drinker and a democrat he felt that wellrun prostitution could be a healthy part of a citys economycitation needed he was also on friendly terms with the regions native americans while many of the denny party were not thus maynard was not on the best of terms with what became the seattle establishment especially after the puget sound war he was nearly written out of the citys history until

metropolitan seattle567891011 the dkhwduwabsh and xachuabsh are today represented by the duwamish tribe george vancouver was the first european to visit the seattle area in may 1792 during his 179195 expedition to chart the pacific northwest12 the first white forays for sites in the area were in the 1830s13 the founding of seattle is usually dated from the arrival of the denny party on november 13 1851 at alki point the group had travelled overland from the midwest to portland oregon then made a short ocean journey up the pacific coast into puget sound with the express intent of founding a town the next april arthur a denny abandoned the original site at alki in favor of a betterprotected site on elliott bay near the south end of what is now downtown seattle around the same time doc maynard began settling the land immediately south of dennys charles c terry and others hung on at alki for a few more years but eventually it became clear that maynard and denny had chosen the better location the first plats for seattle were filed on may 23 1853 nominal legal land settlement was provisionally established in 1855 with treaty terms for what is now seattle not implemented doc maynards land claim lay south of todays yesler way encompassing most of todays pioneer square historical district and the international district he based his street grid on strict compass bearings the more northerly plats of arthur a denny and carson d boren encompassed pioneer square north of what is now yesler way the heart of the current downtown and the western slope of first hill these had street grids that more or less followed the shoreline the downtown grid from yesler way north to stewart street is oriented 32 degrees west of north from stewart north to denny way the orientation is 49 degrees west of north the result is a tangle of streets where the grids clash see also street layout of seattle both alki and the settlement that was to become seattle relied in their early decades on the timber industry shipping out logs and later milled timber to build and rebuild san francisco which as bill speidel points out kept burning down seattle and alki offered plenty of trees to build san francisco and plenty of hills to slide them down to water a climax forest of trees up to 1000–2000 years old and towering as high as nearly 400 feet 120 m covered much of what is now seattle today none of that size remain anywhere in the world1415 relations with the nativesedit see also cheshiahud and duwamish tribe § history this section draws heavily on bill speidel sons of the profits 1967 and doc maynard 1978 doc maynard and murray morgan skid road 1951 1960 1982 are especially useful on the events regarding resistance nominally led by kamiakim in the january 1856 attack on the town generally before the point elliott treatyedit the early seattle settlers had a sometimes rocky relationship with the local native americans there is no question that the settlers were steadily taking away native lands and in many cases treating the natives terribly there were numerous deadly attacks by settlers against natives and by natives against settlers bill speidel writes in sons of the profits the general consensus of the community was that killing an indian was a matter of no graver consequence than shooting a cougar or a bear against this background doc maynard stands out for his excellent relations with the natives he and chief seattle were friends and allies maynard certainly profited greatly from this friendship but that should not diminish the fact that during the outbreak of violent hostilities in 1856 he risked the wrath of his fellow settlers by protecting neutral indians however outside of some oldtime trappers and traders he was almost unique in his attitude denny and edward lander the latter was the first local federal judge also stood out in that they believed that the law should be applied fairly and equally to them murder was murder regardless of the race of the victim however it was impossible to get this view upheld by a jury in sons of the profits speidel recounts a case of two vigilantes who had hanged a native man after a series of possibly deliberate irregularities in their trial the jury acquitted these obviously guilty men on a technicality territorial governor isaac stevens probably did more damage to relations between settlers and natives than any one other person he put a bounty on scalps of bad indians he declared martial law to prevent lander from issuing writs of habeas corpus for people who were held in jail for little other reason than sympathizing with the natives on at least two occasions he actually had lander himself jailed perhaps worst of all in its consequences for relations he dealt dishonestly in treaties among other things making oral promises that were not matched by what was written down the local natives had at least a thirtyyear history of dealing with the hudsons bay company who had developed a reputation for driving a hard bargain but sticking honestly to what they agreed to and for treating whites and indians impartially this continued through the dealings of the local bureau of indian affairs superintendent general joel palmer who along with maynards brotherinlaw indian agent mike simmons was among the few evenhanded men in the bia consequently when stevens in drafting treaties acted in a manner that judge james wickerson would characterize forty years later as unfair unjust ungenerous and illegal some natives quite unprepared for such behavior by the official representatives of the white mans power were angered to the point of war the unjust and deliberately confusing western washington treaties such as that of medicine creek december 26 1854 and point elliott now mukilteo january 22 1855 were followed by the yet more provocative treaty of walla walla may 21 1855 as stevens pointedly ignored federal government instructions to stick to sorting out the areas where natives and settlers found themselves immediately adjacent to one another or from the other perspective where settlers moved right in on native places generally after the point elliott treatyedit by the time of the treaty of point elliott maynard had already made an ally of chief seattle by arranging to have him somewhat compensated for the use of his name for the new town chief seattles ancestral religion and coast salish culture have beliefs opposed to speaking or using a persons name after that persons death and prior to protocols so this was not a simple matter although chief seattle soon converted to a somewhat eclectic roman catholicism see also duwamish at point elliott maynard cemented this alliance and greatly benefited his emerging town by getting chief seattle and the duwamish a separate more favorable treaty which in exchange for a relatively large reservation promised not yet ever fulfilled natives abandoned all aboriginal title to 54790 acres 2217 km2 constituting an area almost identical to the eventual twentiethcentury city limits of the city of seattle for nearly nothing at the time with stevens in eastern washington sowing discord secretary of state charles mason was left in charge of the state government yakama chief kamiakim had effectively declared war and told nations such as the duwamish that they could either join him or would be treated as enemies by autumn there had been an exchange of massacres by whites and settlers in which both sides seemed ready to kill whichever people of the other race were at hand with no regard for whether these particular individuals had in any way previously wronged them this cycle of retaliatory violence would reach its logical conclusion two years after the war when the brilliant and generally respected siab lescay chief leschi was tried and condemned to death for a murder he almost certainly did not commit and hanged before his appeal could be properly heard maynard got mike simmons to deputize him as a special indian agent then—in a complex multiway transaction—cemented a relationship with acting governor mason and some other key figures by selling them some prime seattle real estate at a good price he then used the money from the transaction to buy supplies and a boat to ferry chief seattle and his duwamish to what was effectively a privately funded reservation at port madison west of puget sound he also at enormous personal risk spent the first several weeks of november 1855 traveling around eastern king county which was already penetrated by some of kamiakims men informing several hundred other neutral natives that there was a safe place they could go most of them took him up on it induced fear effected abandonment of places natives were otherwise loath to leave in doc maynard bill speidel reports that not all of the seattle businessmen were pleased with his getting the local indians out of the way henry yesler and others found themselves deprived of much of their labor force and wrote letters of protest to the territorial government shortly before stevens returned to olympia january 16 1856 captain ed keyes had managed an uneasy informal truce by communicating with among others chief leschi stevens promptly undercut the truce saying of the natives nothing but death is mete punishment for their perfidy on january 25 1856 stevens announced the town of seattle is in as much danger of an indian attack as are the cities of san francisco or new york on january 26 1856 natives attacked the seattle settlement friendly indians permitted to stay in seattle had warned the whites and sentries had been put on patrol in the morning acting on tip a shell was lobbed into the forest above the town what is now first hill first fire the indians fired back small arms settlers rushed from their cabins to the blockhouse the defenses were based on a large wooden blockhouse a fivefoothigh woodandearth breastworks various ravines—and the cannon just offshore zeroed bearing and range laid in the settlement was defended at the time by the 150 man 566 ton 16 gun sloopofwar decatur the bark bronte seven outoftown civilian volunteers fifty local volunteers and at least 6 marines from the decatur the number of attackers is impossible to establish estimates range from a mere thirty to 2000 with more than a hundred killed another hundred wounded not so much as a single indian body was ever found not even a sign of blood the indians had made no attempt to storm the stockade no one in the blockhouse was much interested in venturing out on attack both sides had paused for dinner there were two known fatalities a young volunteer and a 14yearold boy both of whom had neglected to stay behind cover no one who kept inside the stockade was wounded a few things do seem clear in this fog of war nearly all of the local volunteers hardly left the blockhouse the navy took no combat casualties in this land battle and kamiakims forces were successfully driven off but also took few if any fatalities16 still they seem to have drawn the conclusion that attacking a major settlement wasnt worth the trouble the only remaining major battle of the war was to occur march 10 at connells prairie near puyallup after the skirmish battle of seattleedit the cessation of general hostilities did not diminish stevens crusading zeal against the natives he encouraged fratricidal war by offering the good indians a bounty for scalps of the bad indians the largest collector of such rewards was chief seattles sworn rival chief patkanim a leader among the snoqualmie and snohomish according to speidel patkanim was not above killing and scalping his own slaves as a means of generating income speidel also narrates in sons of the profits that on one occasion this led to a native being killed and scalped in stevens own office stevens continually attempted to recruit chief seattle and the duwamish to this cause maynard and chief seattle who had already gone to great lengths to help keep the duwamish at a safe distance from patkanim never actually refused the governors request but instead maintained a successful pattern of stalling and passive resistance to avoid ever providing any duwamish fighters to further stevens scheme a smallpox epidemic broke out among the northwest tribes in 1862 killing roughly half of the native population documentation in archives and historical epidemiology demonstrates that governmental policies furthered the progress of the epidemic among the natives17 the seattle establishment including doc maynard petitioned the territorial delegate to congress in 1866 to deny treaty rights to the duwamish the commitments made by the united states government in the point elliott treaty have not yet been met18 yeslers milledit top view looking west to yeslers mill at the end of the street see smokestack and nearby cookhouse the tall pole in the road on the right is where the pioneer square pergola stands today 1874 bottom yeslers mill stores and taverns on skid road mill street now yesler way at first alki was larger than seattle it was platted into six blocks of eight lots and most of them had buildings on them that were in use there werent eight level usable blocks in all of seattle19 however when henry yesler brought financial backing from a massillon ohio capitalist john e mclain to start a steam sawmill once he had isolated the perfect location for such a structure20 he chose a seattle location on the waterfront where maynard and dennys plats met thereafter seattle would dominate the lumber industry yesler selected this location because of a critical flaw with alki as a port during the winter the north wind building up the tides in front of it comes sweeping down the sound out of canada piling mighty waves on alki point beginning with terry nobody has been able to build anything out in the water at alki that will withstand those waves21 the road leading down the hill to that mill later called mill street and now known as yesler way was originally known as the skid road the route for skidding logs down to the mill hence the term skid road or corrupted as skid row for a rundown or dilapidated urban area as the mill declined and the area collapsed with the crash and great depression22 via the bargaining power of his mill yesler wrangled about 20220 square feet 1878 m2 of prime land from some of the original settlers besides his mill yesler started a cookhouse that did more to set the heart of the city in the middle of yeslers property holdings than anything else henry did henry never did make a lot of money out of his mill it was the strategic location of his land that made him a millionaire23 like many of seattles early entrepreneurs yesler was not always the most scrupulous about how he made his money he borrowed 30000 at 8 interest to build the mill and repaid mclain only after mclain took yesler to court three times a city growsedit seattle engraving from harpers new monthly magazine september 1870 the first seattle fortunes were founded on logs and later milled timber shipped south for the construction of buildings in san francisco seattle itself in the early years was of course also a place of wooden buildings and remained so until the great fire of june 6 1889 even the early system of delivering water to the settlement used hollowedout logs for pipes seattle in its early years relied on the timber industry shipping logs and later milled timber to san francisco terry sold out alki which after his departure barely held on as a settlement moved to seattle and began acquiring land he either owned or partially owned the first ships that allowed seattles timber industry to exist by providing a means to move the product to market he eventually gave a land grant to the university of the territory of washington that housed its original campus and today makes the university of washington a downtown landlord collecting rents of more than 1 million a year he worked in politics to establish street grades a water system and a host of other services which not coincidentally benefited him as one of the citys largest landholders meanwhile arthur denny became the second richest man in town after yesler and got himself elected to territorial legislature from that position he tried unsuccessfully to get the territorial capital moved to seattle from its then supposedly temporary location in olympia the other potential money prizes were the territorial penitentiary and the territorial university when the politics all played out vancouver wound up as the proposed capital port townsend was supposed to get the penitentiary and seattle got the university apparently seattle was the only real winner in this deal to this day olympia remains the capital of washington the main state penitentiary is in walla walla the legislature had tacked on the requirement that a grant of 10 acres 40000 m2 of land would be required for the university to be built which they presumably thought would be sufficient to prevent its construction however denny wanted his town to grow and donated the land creating what would be one of the biggest and most effective central core properties in the united states24 the university of the territory of washington later the university of washington opened on november 4 1861 there were barely enough students to run it as a high school let alone as a university but over time it grew into its originally grandiose name the logging town developed rapidly into a small city despite being officially founded by the methodists of the denny party seattle quickly developed a reputation as a wideopen town a haven for prostitution liquor and gambling some attribute this at least in part to maynard who arrived separately from the denny party and who had a rather different view of what it would take to build a city based on his experience in growing cleveland ohio by selling some of his land cheaply on condition that businesses be soon built upon them he recruited professionals such as blacksmiths and purveyors of vice who enhanced the value of his remaining land the citys first brothel dated from 1861 and was founded by one john pinnell or pennell who was already involved in similar business in san francisco real estate records show that nearly all of the citys first 60 businesses were on or immediately adjacent to maynards plat second ave and marion st seattle wash july 1889 seattle was incorporated as a town january 14 1865 the incorporators were charles c terry henry l yesler david t denny charles plummer and hiram burnett an officer of the largest puget sound lumber company pope talbot that charter was voided january 18 1867 in response to unrest seattle was reincorporated as a city on december 2 1869 at the times of incorporation the population was approximately 350 and 1000 respectively25 railroad rivalry and encroaching civilizationedit seattle looking south from pine street 1880 on july 14 1873 the northern pacific railway announced that they had chosen the thensmall town of tacoma over seattle as the western terminus of their transcontinental railroad the railroad barons appear to have been gambling on the advantage they could gain from being able to buy up the land around their terminus cheaply instead of bringing the railroad into a more established pacific port town unwilling to be bypassed the citizens of seattle chartered their own railroad the seattle walla walla to link with the union pacific railroad in eastern washington the sww never got beyond renton but that was far enough to connect with new coal mines fueling industry in seattle the later seattle lake shore eastern railway was only moderately more successful although it did provide a route for logs to come to the city from as far away as arlington washington boost development of towns and help seattle hit the jackpot with the northern pacific the great northern railway chose seattle as the terminus for its transcontinental road in 1893 winning seattle a place in competition for freight traffic to california and across the pacific the seattle lake shore eastern was over the years incorporated into the northern pacific and then the burlington northern railways2627 the line was abandoned as a railroad in 1971 with the general decline in rail and became in 1978 a foot and bicycle route renamed the burkegilman trail then gradually greatly extended seattles first streetcar 1884 at the corner of occidental and yesler second av yesler way seattle 1904 as has been remarked seattle in this era was an open and often relatively lawless town although it boasted two englishlanguage newspapers and for a while a third in norwegian and telephones had arrived in town lynch law sometimes prevailed there were at least four lynchings in 1882 schools barely operated and indoor plumbing was a rare novelty in the low mud flats where much of the city was built sewage was almost as likely to come in on the tide as to flow away potholes in the street were so bad that legend has it there was at least one fatal drowning a lynching in 1882 drawn by a w piper28 the 1882 lynchings are well described in murray morgans book skid road the events involved a mob defying an armed sheriff successfully disarming the sheriffs deputies and assaulting judge roger sherman greene who attempted to slash the ropes by which the lynching victims were to be hanged judge greene while not doubting the actual guilt of the lynched men was later to write that the lynchers were cocriminal with the lynched some seattle schools in 1900 in an era during which the washington territory was one of the first parts of the us to briefly allow womens suffrage seattle women attempted to counter these trends and to be a civilizing influence on april 4 1884 15 seattle women founded the ladies relief society to address the number of needy and suffering cases within the limits of the city this eventually resulted in the founding of the seattle childrens home still in operation today other signs of encroaching civilization were the citys first bathtub with plumbing in 187029 and first streetcar in 1884 followed by a cable car from downtown over first hill to leschi park in 1887 in 1885 the city passed an ordinance requiring attached sewer lines for all new residences in 1886 the city got its first ymca gymnasium and in 1888 the exclusive rainier club was founded on december 24 1888 ferry service was inaugurated connecting seattle to west seattle near the location of the denny partys first attempt at settling at alki and reviving that settlement a year later a bridge was built across salmon bay providing a land route to the nearby town of ballard which after 17 years would be annexed to seattle the relative fortunes of seattle and tacoma clearly show the nature of seattles growth though both seattle and tacoma grew at a rapid rate from 1880 to 1890 based on the strength of their timber industries seattles growth as an exporter of services and manufactured goods continued for another two decades while tacomas growth dropped almost to zero the reason for this lies in tacomas nature as a company town and seattles successful avoidance of that condition both seattle and tacoma in the 1880s were essentially lumber towns built on the resulting export income all over the puget sound there are communities that started with the same assets timber and a port however seattles early lead with yeslers mill and other enterprises meant that its economy was based on manufacturing as well as lumber and was thus far more diversified than tacomas the northern pacific railway terminus only increased tacomas lumber trade instead of diversifying the economy meanwhile seattle became the hub for the region and the railroad had to come relations between whites and chineseedit see also seattle riot of 1886 chinese first arrived in seattle around 1860 the northern pacific railway completed the project of laying tracks from lake superior to tacoma washington in 1883 leaving many chinese laborers without employment in 1883 chinese laborers played a key role in the first effort at digging the montlake cut to connect lake unions portage bay to lake washingtons union bay seattles chinese district located near the present day occidental park was a mixed neighborhood of residences over stores laundries and other retail storefronts30 in fall 1885 with a shortage of jobs in the west many workers turned violently antichinese complaining of overly cheap labor competition in the pacific northwest this had the unusual character that the antichinese mobs included significant numbers of the native indians as well as europeanamericans the first massacre of chinese occurred at rock springs wyoming september 2 1885 on september 7 chinese hoppickers were massacred in the squak valley near presentday issaquah similar incidents occurred in the nearby mining camps at coal creek and black diamond many chinese headed from these isolated rural areas into the cities but it did them little good on october 24 a mob burned a large portion of seattles chinatown on november 3 a mob of 300 expelled the chinese in tacoma loading them into boxcars with surprisingly little actual violence before moving on to force similar expulsions in smaller towns313233 violent opposition to the chinese at this time was inseparable from labor union organizing the prolabor seattle call routinely described the chinese in brutally racist terms leading figures in the antichinese movement included knights of labor organizer dan cronin and seattle socialist agitator mary kenworthy the utopian socialist george venable smith was also of this party nor did the chinese have many strong defenders among the wealthier classes who however mostly favored a more orderly departure of the chinese to massacre and riot the policy of henry yesler who was serving as mayor at this time34 a contemporary depiction of events related to the antichinese riot of 1886 among the few defenders of the rule of law were the methodist episcopal ministers association and judge thomas burke burke an irish immigrant and generally a friend of labor was nonetheless a stronger defender of the constitution he also spoke out that his fellow irish should identify with the chinese as fellow immigrants a view which fell almost entirely on deaf ears35 on february 7 1886 wellorganized antichinese order committees descended on seattles chinatown claiming to be health inspectors declaring chineseoccupied buildings to be unfit for habitation rousting out the residents and herding them down to the harbor where the queen of the pacific was docked the police were willing to intervene only to the point of preventing the chinese from being physically harmed not to challenging the mob it is quite probable that if ships captain jack alexander had been willing simply to board the chinese and take them away the mob would entirely have ruled the day however he was not in the business of hauling nonpaying passengers the mob raised several hundred dollars 86 chinese were boarded but this delay gave the mayor judge burke the us attorney and others time both to rally the home guard and to serve alexander with a writ of habeas corpus a plot to deport the chinese by rail was foiled when sheriff mcgraw threatened to prosecute the railroad superintendent for kidnapping36 the following day judge greene made it clear that those chinese who wished to remain would be protected but by now after what they had been through all but sixteen preferred to leave alexander by now was anxious to keep his operations strictly legal37 and would board only the 196 passengers for which his ship was rated slightly more than half of the chinese who were ready to leave possibly due to poor communication the antichinese faction were unsatisfied a resulting scuffle resulted in one dead and four others wounded among the antichinese faction and martial law was imposed ultimately the bulk of the chinese remained in seattle and the us government out of humane consideration and without reference to liability paid out 27661915 to the chinese government but nothing to the victims themselves38 the great seattle fireedit the early seattle era came to a stunning halt with the great seattle fire of june 6 1889 it burned 29 city blocks destroying most of the central business district no one however perished in the flames and the city quickly rebounded from the destruction thanks in part to credit arranged by jacob furth as well as according to speidel brothelowner lou graham seattle rebuilt from the ashes with astounding rapidity a new zoning code resulted in a downtown of brick and stone buildings rather than wood in the single year after the fire the city grew from 25000 to 40000 inhabitants largely because of the enormous number of construction jobs suddenly created39 labor history in 19th century seattleedit tinfoiling rainier beer bottles 1900 the pacific northwest economy during the nineteenth century was heavily rooted in extractive industries mainly logging still seattle was becoming a city and union organizing arrived first in the form of a skilled craft union in 1882 seattle printers formed the seattle typographical union local 202 dockworkers followed in 1886 cigarmakers in 1887 tailors in 1889 and both brewers and musicians in 1890 even the newsboys unionized in 1892 followed by more organizing mostly of craft unions according to various analyses and as evident through general readings in news coverage of the time the history of labor in this period is inseparable from the issue of antichinese vigilantism as discussed above a roughandready approach to labor organizing was typical of the period and there is no question that white seattlearea laborers at this time saw cheap chinese labor as their prime competition and strove to eliminate it by eliminating the chinese immigrants this section is still mostly a stub you can help wikipedia by fixing it the klondike gold rushedit the central waterfront during the gold rush 1897 railroad avenue now alaskan way along the seattle waterfront 1900 seattle as well as the rest of the nation was hard hit by the panic of 1893 and to a lesser extent the panic of 1896 unlike many other cities it soon found salvation in the form of becoming the main transportation and supply center for stampeders heading for the klondike gold rush when the steamer ss portland arrived at schwabachers wharf in seattle july 17 1897 the seattle postintelligencer scooped all other us newspapers with the story that a ton of gold had arrived from alaska a publicity campaign engineered largely by erastus brainerd successfully convinced the world that seattle was the place to be outfitted for the journey to alaska and seattle became a household name literally overnight the miners mined the gold seattle mined the miners40 seattles relationship with alaska during this period was generally one of rapacity besides the mining on october 18 1899 in pioneer square a chamber of commerce committee of fifteen just back from a goodwill visit to alaska proudly unveiled a 60foot 18 m totem pole from fort tongass the problem was the pole had been stolen from the tlingit village of gaash on cape fox a federal grand jury in alaska indicted eight of seattles most prominent citizens for theft of government property a nominal fine was assessed41 the village was repaid when the original burned and the chamber of commerce commissioned a replacement—and paid twice thank you for the check wrote
