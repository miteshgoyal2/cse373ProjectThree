bibliography journals list of indigenous peoples organizations anthropology portal v t e daniel miller born 1954 is an anthropologist most closely associated with studies of our relationships to things and the consequences of consumption his theoretical work was first developed in material culture and mass consumption and is summarised more recently in his book stuff this is concerned to transcend the usual dualism between subject and object and to study how social relations are created through consumption as an activity contents 1 education 2 anthropological position 3 major works 4 further reading 5 external links 6 references educationedit miller was originally trained in archaeology and anthropology at the university of cambridge but has spent his entire professional life at the department of anthropology at the university college london which has become a research center for the study of material culture and where more recently he established the worlds first programme dedicated to the study of digital anthropology anthropological positionedit a prolific author miller criticises the concept of materialism which presumes our relationships to things are at the expense of our relationship to persons he argues that most people are either enabled to form close relationships to both persons and objects or have difficulties with both with his students he has applied these ideas to many genres of material culture such as clothing homes media and the car through research based on the methods of traditional anthropological ethnography in regions including the caribbean india and london in the study of clothing his work ranges from a book on the sari in india to more recent research explaining the popularity of blue jeans and the way they exemplify the struggle to become ordinary his initial work on the consequences of the internet for trinidad was followed by studies of the impact of mobile phones on poverty in jamaica and more recently the way facebook has changed the nature of social relationships his work on material culture also includes ethnographic research on how people develop relationships of love and care through the acquisition of objects in shopping and how they deal with issues of separation and loss including death through their retention and divestment of objects he argues that since we cannot control death as an event we use our ability to control the gradual separation from the objects associated with the deceased as a way of dealing with loss complementary to this work on separation from things are three books about shopping the most influential of which a theory of shopping looks at how the study of everyday purchases can be a route to understanding how love operates within the family he has also carried out several projects on female domestic labour and being a mother including studies of au pairs and filipina women in london and their relationship to their left behind children in the philippines most of these projects are collaborations since the early 2000s he has been researching the effects of new social media on society several of his most recent books explore topics such as cell phones1 facebook2 and transnational families3 together with presenting a theoretical framework for studying social networking sites4 his latest work has proposed a new concept of polymedia5 as an analytical tool to examine the consequences of a situation where individuals configure and are held responsible for their choice of media while access and cost recede as factors in 2009 he created a new masters programme in digital anthropology at the university college londons anthropology department in 2012 he launched a fiveyear project called social networking and social sciences research project to examine the global impact of new social media the study will be based on ethnographic data collected through the course of 15 months in china india turkey italy united kingdom trinidad chile and brazil the project is funded by the european research council the results of this project were released on 29 february 2016 under the title why we post this included the first three of eleven open
