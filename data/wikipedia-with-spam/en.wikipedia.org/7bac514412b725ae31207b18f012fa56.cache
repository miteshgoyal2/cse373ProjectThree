operator features in programming languages 9 see also 10 notes 11 references syntaxedit syntactically operators usually contrast to functions in most languages functions may be seen as a special form of prefix operator with fixed precedence level and associativity often with compulsory parentheses eg funca or func a in lisp most languages support programmerdefined functions but cannot really claim to support programmerdefined operators unless they have more than prefix notation and more than a single precedence level semantically operators can be seen as special form of function with different calling notation and a limited number of parameters usually 1 or 2 the position of the operator with respect to its operands may be prefix infix or postfix and the syntax of an expression involving an operator depends on its arity number of operands precedence and if applicable associativity most programming languages support binary operators and a few unary operators with a few supporting more operands such as the operator in c which is ternary there are prefix unary operators such as unary minus x and postfix unary operators such as postincrement x and binary operations are infix such as x y or x y infix operations of higher arity require additional symbols such as the ternary operator  in c written as a  b  c – indeed this is the only common example it is often referred to as the ternary operator prefix and postfix operations can support any desired arity however such as 1 2 3 4 occasionally12 parts of a language may be described as matchfix or circumfix34 operators either to simplify the languages description or implementation a circumfix operator consists of two or more parts which enclose its operands circumfix operators have the highest precedence with their contents being evaluated and the resulting value used in the surrounding expression the most familiar circumfix operator are the parentheses mentioned above used to indicate which parts of an expression are to be evaluated before others another example from physics is the inner product notation of diracs bra–ket notation circumfix operators are especially useful to denote operations that involve many or varying numbers of operands the specification of a language will specify the syntax the operators it supports while languages such as prolog that support programmerdefined operators require that the syntax be defined by the programmer semanticsedit the semantics of operators particularly depends on value evaluation strategy and argument passing mode such as boolean shortcircuiting simply an expression involving an operator is evaluated in some way and the resulting value may be just a value an rvalue or may be an object allowing assignment an lvalue in simple cases this is identical to usual function calls for example addition x y is generally equivalent to a function call addx y and lessthan comparison x y to ltx y meaning that the arguments are evaluated in their usual way then some function is evaluated and the result is returned as a value however the semantics can be significantly different for example in assignment a b the target a is not evaluated but instead its location address is used to store the value of b – corresponding to callbyreference semantics further an assignment may be a statement no value or may be an expression value with the value itself either an rvalue just a value or an lvalue able to be assigned to as another example the scope resolution operator  and the element access operator as in foobar or ab operate not on values but on names essentially callbyname semantics and their value is a name use of lvalues as operator operands is particularly notable in unary increment and decrement operators in c for instance the following statement is legal and welldefined and depends on the fact that array indexing returns an lvalue x ai an important use is when a leftassociative binary operator modifies its left argument or produces a side effect and then evaluates to that argument as an lvaluea this allows a sequence of operators all affecting the original argument allowing a fluent interface similar to method cascading a common example is the operator in the c iostream library which allows fluent output as follows cout hello world endl userdefined operatorsedit a language may contain a fixed number of builtin operators eg   etc in c and c php or it may allow the creation of programmerdefined operators eg f ocaml haskell some programming languages restrict operator symbols to special characters like or while others allow also names like div eg pascal most languages have a builtin set of operators but do not allow userdefined operators as this significantly complicates parsingb many languages only allow operators to be used for builtin types but others allow existing operators to be used for userdefined types this is known as operator overloading some languages allow new operators to be defined however either at compile time or at run time this may involve metaprogramming specifying the operators in a separate language or within the language itself definition of new operators particularly runtime definition often makes correct static analysis of programs impossible since the syntax of the language may be turingcomplete so even constructing the syntax tree may require solving the halting problem which is impossible this occurs for perl for example and some dialects of lisp examplesedit see also categoryoperators programming common examples that differ syntactically are mathematical arithmetic operations eg for greater than with names often outside the languages set of identifiers for functions and called with a syntax different from the languages syntax for calling functions as a function greater than would generally be named by an identifier such as gt or greaterthan and called as a function as gtx y instead the operation uses the special character which is tokenized separately during lexical analysis and infix notation as x y common examples that differ semantically by argument passing mode are boolean operations which frequently feature shortcircuit evaluation eg a shortcircuiting conjunction x and y that only evaluates later arguments if earlier ones are not false in a language with strict callbyvalue functions this behaves instead similarly to ifthenelse less common operators include comma operator e f dereference operator p and addressof operator x or ternary operator number spelloutnumbers  fortytwo  42 elvis operator x  y null coalescing operator x  y spaceship operator for threeway comparison x y compilationedit a compiler can implement operators and functions with subroutine calls or with inline code some builtin operators supported by a language have a direct mapping to a small number of instructions commonly found on central processing units though others eg used to express string concatenation may have complicated implementations operator overloadingedit main article operator overloading in some programming languages an operator may be adhoc polymorphic that is have definitions for more than one kind of data such as in java where the operator is used both for the addition of numbers and for the concatenation of strings such an operator is said to be overloaded in languages that support operator overloading by the programmer such as c but have a limited set of operators operator overloading is often used to define customized uses for operators in the example if orderdate 12312011 and orderdate 01012013 then continue else stop the operators are greater than and and less than operand coercionedit further information type conversion some languages also allow for the operands of an operator to be implicitly converted or coerced to suitable data types for the operation to occur for example in perl coercion rules lead into 12 314 producing the result of 1514 the text 314 is converted to the number 314 before addition can take place further 12 is an integer and 314 is either a floating or fixedpoint number a number that has a decimal place in it so the integer is then converted to a floating point or fixedpoint number respectively javascript follows opposite rules—finding the same expression above it will convert the integer 12 into a string 12 then concatenate the two operands to form 12314 in the presence of coercions in a language the programmer must be aware of the specific rules regarding operand types and the operation result type to avoid subtle programming mistakes operator features in
