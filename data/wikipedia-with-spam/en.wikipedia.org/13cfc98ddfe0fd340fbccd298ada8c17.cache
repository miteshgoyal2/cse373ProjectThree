harvesting or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites1 web scraping software may access the world wide web directly using the hypertext transfer protocol or through a web browser while web scraping can be done manually by a software user the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler it is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web typically into a central local database or spreadsheet for later retrieval or analysis web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it12 fetching is the downloading of a page which a browser does when you view the page therefore web crawling is a main component of web scraping to fetch pages for later processing once fetched then extraction can take place the content of a page may be parsed searched reformatted its data copied into a spreadsheet and so on web scrapers typically take something out of a page to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else an example would be to find and copy names and phone numbers or companies and their urls to a list contact scraping web scraping is used for contact scraping and as a component of applications used for web indexing web mining and data mining online price change monitoring and price comparison product review scraping to watch the competition gathering real estate listings weather data monitoring website change detection research tracking online presence and reputation web mashup and web data integration web pages are built using textbased markup languages html and xhtml and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form however most web pages are designed for human endusers and not for ease of automated use because of this tool kits that scrape web content were created a web scraper is an api to extract data from a web site companies like amazon aws and google provide web scraping tools services and public data available free of cost to end users newer forms of web scraping involve listening to data feeds from web servers for example json is commonly used as a transport storage mechanism between the client and the web server there are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling viewing their pages in response there are web scraping systems that rely on using techniques in dom parsing computer vision and natural language processing to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing contents 1 techniques 11 human copyandpaste 12 text pattern matching 13 http programming 14 html parsing 15 dom parsing 16 vertical aggregation 17 semantic annotation recognizing 18 computer vision webpage analysis 2 software 21 example tools 211 javascript tools 212 saas version 213 web crawling frameworks 3 legal issues 31 united states 32 outside the united states 4 methods to prevent web scraping 5 see also 6 references techniquesedit web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the world wide web it is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the semantic web vision an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing semantic understanding artificial intelligence and humancomputer interactions current web scraping solutions range from the adhoc requiring human effort to fully automated systems that are able to convert entire web sites into structured information with limitations human copyandpasteedit sometimes even the best webscraping technology cannot replace a human’s manual examination and copyandpaste and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation text pattern matchingedit a simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the unix grep command or regular expressionmatching facilities of programming languages for instance perl or python http programmingedit static and dynamic web pages can be retrieved by posting http requests to the remote web server using socket programming html parsingedit many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template in data mining a program that detects such templates in a particular information source extracts its content and translates it into a relational form is called a wrapper wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a url common scheme3 moreover some semistructured data query languages such as xquery and the htql can be used to parse html pages and to retrieve and transform page content dom parsingedit further information document object model by embedding a fullfledged web browser such as the internet explorer or the mozilla browser control programs can retrieve the dynamic content generated by clientside scripts these browser controls also parse web pages into a dom tree based on which programs can retrieve parts of the pages vertical aggregationedit there are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms these platforms create and monitor a multitude of “bots” for specific verticals with no man in the loop no direct human involvement and no work related to a specific target site the preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically the platforms robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves usually number of fields and its scalability how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites this scalability is mostly used to target the long tail of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too laborintensive to harvest content from semantic annotation recognizingedit the pages being scraped may embrace metadata or semantic markups and annotations which can be used to locate specific data snippets if the annotations are embedded in the pages as microformat does this technique can be viewed as a special case of dom parsing in another case the annotations organized into a semantic layer4 are stored and managed separately from the web pages so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages computer vision webpage analysisedit there are efforts using machine learning and computer vision that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might5 softwareedit there are many software tools available that can be used to customize webscraping solutions this software may attempt to automatically recognize the data structure of a page or provide a recording interface that removes the necessity to manually write webscraping code or some scripting functions that can be used to extract and transform content and database interfaces that can store the scraped data in local databases some web scraping software can also be used to extract data from an api directly example toolsedit curl – command line tool and library for transferring including getting data with urls supporting a wide range of http methods get post cookies etc data toolbar – web scraping addon for internet explorer mozilla firefox and google chrome web browsers that collects and converts structured data from web pages into a tabular format that can be loaded into a spreadsheet or database management program diffbot – uses computer vision and

united states and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject you may improve this article discuss the issue on the talk page or create a new article as appropriate october 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message the legality of web scraping varies across the world in general web scraping may be against the terms of use of some websites but the enforceability of these terms is unclear6 united statesedit in the united states website owners can use three major legal claims to prevent undesired web scraping 1 copyright infringement compilation 2 violation of the computer fraud and abuse act “cfaa” and 3 trespass to chattel7 however the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria and the case law is still evolving for example with regard to copyright while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal in the united states the courts ruled in feist publications v rural telephone service that duplication of facts is allowable us courts have acknowledged that users of scrapers or robots may be held liable for committing trespass to chattels89 which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing the best known of these cases ebay v bidders edge resulted in an injunction ordering bidders edge to stop accessing collecting and indexing auctions from the ebay web site this case involved automatic placing of bids known as auction sniping however in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to chattels the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiffs possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendants unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels10 one of the first major tests of screen scraping involved american airlines aa and a firm called farechase11 aa successfully obtained an injunction from a texas trial court stopping farechase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if the software also searches aas website the airline argued that farechases websearch software trespassed on aas servers when it collected the publicly available data farechase filed an appeal in march 2003 by june farechase and aa agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped12 southwest airlines has also challenged screenscraping practices and has involved both farechase and another firm outtask in a legal claim southwest airlines charged that the screenscraping is illegal since it is an example of computer fraud and abuse and has led to damage and loss and unauthorized access of southwests site it also constitutes interference with business relations trespass and harmful access by computer they also claimed that screenscraping constitutes what is legally known as misappropriation and unjust enrichment as well as being a breach of the web sites user agreement outtask denied all these claims claiming that the prevailing law in this case should be us copyright law and that under copyright the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection although the cases were never resolved in the supreme court of the united states farechase was eventually shuttered by parent company yahoo and outtask was purchased by travel expense company concur13 in 2012 a startup called 3taps scraped classified housing ads from craigslist craigslist sent 3taps a ceaseanddesist letter and blocked their ip addresses and later sued in craigslist v 3taps the court held that the ceaseanddesist letter and ip blocking was sufficient for craigslist to properly claim that 3taps had violated the computer fraud and abuse act although these are early scraping decisions and the theories of liability are not uniform it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites however the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper the amount of information accessed and copied the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner’s system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct14 while the law in this area becomes more settled entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site in a 2010 ruling in the cvent inc v eventbrite inc in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia the court ruled that the terms of use should be brought to the users attention in order for a browse wrap contract or license to be enforced15 in a 2014 filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania16 ecommerce site qvc objected to the pinterestlike shopping aggregator resultly’s scraping of qvc’s site for realtime pricing data qvc alleges that resultly “excessively crawled” qvc’s retail site allegedly sending 200300 search requests to qvc’s website per minute sometimes to up to 36000 requests per minute which caused qvcs site to crash for two days resulting in lost sales for qvc17 qvcs complaint alleges that the defendant disguised its web crawler to mask its source ip address and thus prevented qvc from quickly repairing the problem this is a particularly interesting scraping case because qvc is seeking damages for the unavailability of their website which qvc claims was caused by resultly in the plaintiffs web site during the period of this trial the terms of use link is displayed among all the links of the site at the bottom of the page as most sites on the internet this ruling contradicts the irish ruling described below the court also rejected the plaintiffs argument that the browse wrap restrictions were enforceable in view of virginias adoption of the uniform computer information transactions act ucita—a uniform law that many believed was in favor on common browse wrap contracting practices18 in facebook inc v power ventures inc a district court ruled in 2012 that power ventures could not scrape facebook pages on behalf of a facebook user the case is on appeal and the electronic frontier foundation filed a brief in 2015 asking that it be overturned1920 in associated press v meltwater us holdings inc a court in the us held meltwater liable for scraping and republishing news information from the associated press but a court in the united kingdom held in favor of meltwater outside the united statesedit outside of the united states in february 2006 the danish maritime and commercial court copenhagen ruled that systematic crawling indexing and deep linking by portal site ofirdk of estate site homedk does not conflict with danish law or the database directive of the european union21 in a february 2010 case complicated by matters of jurisdiction irelands high court delivered a verdict that illustrates the inchoate state of developing case law in the case of ryanair ltd v billigfluegede gmbh irelands high court ruled ryanairs clickwrap agreement to be legally binding in contrast to the findings of the united states district court eastern district of virginia and those of the danish maritime and commercial court mr justice michael hanna ruled that the hyperlink to ryanairs terms and conditions was plainly visible and that placing the onus on the user to agree to terms and conditions in order to gain access to online services is sufficient to comprise a contractual relationship 22 the decision is under appeal in irelands supreme court23 in australia the spam act 2003 outlaws some forms of web harvesting although this only applies to email addresses2425 methods to prevent web scrapingedit the administrator of a website can use various measures to stop or slow a bot some techniques include blocking an ip address either manually or based on criteria such as geolocation and dnsrbl this will also block all browsing from that address disabling any web service api that the websites system might expose bots sometimes declare who they are using user agent strings and can be blocked on that basis using robotstxt googlebot is an example other bots make no distinction between themselves and a human using a browser bots can be blocked by monitoring excess traffic bots can sometimes be blocked with tools to verify that it is a real person accessing the site like a captcha bots are sometimes coded to explicitly break specific captcha patterns or may employ thirdparty services that utilize human labor to read and respond in realtime to captcha challenges commercial antibot services companies offer antibot and antiscraping services for websites a few web application firewalls have limited bot detection capabilities as well locating bots with a honeypot or other method to identify the ip addresses of automated crawlers obfuscation using css sprites to display such data as phone numbers or email addresses at the cost of accessibility to screen reader users because bots rely on consistency in the frontend code of a target website adding small variations to the htmlcss surrounding important data and navigation elements would require more human involvement in the initial set up of a bot and if done effectively may render the target website too difficult to scrape due to the diminished ability to automate the scraping process see alsoedit archiveis comparison of feed aggregators data scraping data wrangling
