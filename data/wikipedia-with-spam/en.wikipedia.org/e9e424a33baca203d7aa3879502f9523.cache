language ominowakiing or gathering place by the water cf potawatomi language manwaking ojibwe language omaniwakiing910 american indian milwaukeeedit the first recorded inhabitants of the milwaukee area are the menominee fox mascouten sauk potawatomi ojibwe all algicalgonquian peoples and hochunk winnebago a siouan people native american tribes many of these people had lived around green bay11 before migrating to the milwaukee area around the time of european contact in the second half of the 18th century the indians at milwaukee played a role in all the major wars on the american continent during the french and indian war a group of ojibwas and pottawattamies from the far lake michigan ie the area from milwaukee to green bay joined the frenchcanadian daniel liénard de beaujeu at the battle of the monongahela12 in the american revolutionary war the indians around milwaukee were some of the few native americans allied with the americans throughout the revolution13 after american independence the indians fought the united states in the northwest indian war as part of the council of three fires during the war of 1812 indians held a council in milwaukee in june 1812 which resulted in their decision to attack chicago14 this resulted in the battle of fort dearborn on august 15 1812 the only known armed conflict in the chicago area the war of 1812 did not end well for the indians and after the black hawk war in 1832 the indians in milwaukee signed their final treaty with the united states in chicago in 1833 this paved the way for american settlement milwaukee since european settlementedit statue of solomon juneau who helped establish the city of milwaukee europeans had arrived in the milwaukee area prior to the 1833 treaty of chicago french missionaries and traders first passed through the area in the late 17th and 18th centuries alexis laframboise in 1785 coming from michilimackinac now in michigan settled a trading post therefore he is the first european descent resident of the milwaukee region15 early explorers called the milwaukee river and surrounding lands various names melleorki milwacky mahnawaukie milwarck and milwaucki for many years printed records gave the name as milwaukie one story of milwaukees name says one day during the thirties of the last century 1800s a newspaper calmly changed the name to milwaukee and milwaukee it has remained until this day16 the spelling milwaukie lives on in milwaukie oregon named after the wisconsin city in 1847 before the current spelling was universally accepted milwaukee has three founding fathers solomon juneau byron kilbourn and george h walker solomon juneau was the first of the three to come to the area in 1818 he was not the first european settler alexis laframboise settled a trading post in 178515 but founded a town called juneaus side or juneautown that began attracting more settlers in competition with juneau byron kilbourn established kilbourntown west of the milwaukee river and made sure the streets running toward the river did not join with those on the east side this accounts for the large number of angled bridges that still exist in milwaukee today further kilbourn distributed maps of the area which only showed kilbourntown implying juneautown did not exist or the rivers east side was uninhabited and thus undesirable the third prominent builder was george h walker he claimed land to the south of the milwaukee river along with juneautown where he built a log house in 1834 this area grew and became known as walkers point the first large wave of settlement to the areas that would later become milwaukee county and the city of milwaukee began in 1835 early that year it became known juneau and kilbourn intended to lay out competing townsites and by the years end both had purchased their lands from the government and made their first sales there were perhaps 100 new settlers in this year mostly from new england and other eastern states on september 17 1835 the first election was held in milwaukee the number of votes cast was 3917 by 1840 the three towns had grown quite a bit along with their rivalries there were intense battles between the towns mainly juneautown and kilbourntown which culminated with the milwaukee bridge war of 1845 following the bridge war it was decided the best course of action was to officially unite the towns so on january 31 1846 they combined to incorporate as the city of milwaukee and elected solomon juneau as milwaukees first mayor18 illustrated map of milwaukee in 1872 milwaukee began to grow as a city as high numbers of immigrants mainly german made their way to wisconsin during the 1840s and 1850s scholars classify german immigration to the united states in three major waves and wisconsin received a significant number of immigrants from all three the first wave from 1845 to 1855 consisted mainly of people from southwestern germany the second wave from 1865 to 1873 concerned primarily northwestern germany while the third wave from 1880 to 1893 came from northeastern germany19 in the 1840s the number of people who left germanspeaking lands was 385434 in the 1850s it reached 976072 and an alltime high of 14 million emigrated in the 1880s in 1890 the 278 million firstgeneration german americans represented the second largest foreignborn group in the united states of all those who left the german lands between 1835 and 1910 90 percent went to the united states most of them traveling to the midatlantic states and the midwest19 by 1900 34 percent of milwaukees population was of german background19 the largest number of german immigrants to milwaukee came from prussia followed by bavaria saxony hanover and hessedarmstadt milwaukee gained its reputation for the most german of american cities not just from the large number of german immigrants it received but the sense of community which the immigrants established there20 most german immigrants came to wisconsin in search of inexpensive farmland20 however immigration began to change in character and size in the late 1840s and early 1850s due to the 1848 revolutionary movements in europe21 after 1848 hopes for a united germany had failed and revolutionary and radical germans known as the fortyeighters turned their attention to the united states one of the most famous liberal revolutionaries of 1848 was carl schurz who explained why he came to milwaukee in 1854 it is true similar things cultural events and societies were done in other cities where the fortyeighters sic had congregated but so far as i know nowhere did their influence so quickly impress itself upon the whole social atmosphere as in german athens of america as milwaukee was called at the time22 schurz was referring to the various clubs and societies germans developed in milwaukee the pattern of german immigrants to settle near each other encouraged the continuation of german lifestyle and customs this resulted in german language organizations that encompassed all aspects of life for example singing societies and gymnastics clubs germans also made a lasting impact on the american school system kindergarten was created as a preschool for children and sports programs of all levels as well as music and art were incorporated as elements of the regular school curriculum these ideas were first introduced by radicaldemocratic german groups such as the socialist turner societies known today as the american turners specifically in milwaukee the american turners established its own normal college for teachers of physical education and a germanenglish academy23 milwaukees german element is still strongly present today the city celebrates its german culture by annually hosting a german fest in july and an oktoberfest in october milwaukee boasts a number of german restaurants as well as a traditional german beer hall even the german language is not lost as a german language immersion school is offered for children in grades k524 germans were and still are an important component of life in wisconsin and milwaukee milwaukees lake front depot in 1898 although the german presence in milwaukee after the civil war remained strong other groups made their way to the city foremost among these were polish immigrants the poles had many reasons for leaving their homeland mainly poverty and political oppression

depression forced many of them to move back home in the 1950s the hispanic community was beginning to emerge they arrived for jobs filling positions in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors

annual temperature after minneapolisst paul36not in citation given because of milwaukees proximity to lake michigan a convection current forms around midafternoon in light wind resulting in the socalled lake breeze – a smaller scale version of the more common sea breeze the lake breeze is most common between the months of march and july this onshore flow causes cooler temperatures to move inland usually 5 to 15 miles 8 to 24 km with much warmer conditions persisting further inland residents refer to this phenomenon with the phrase cooler by the lake because milwaukees official climate site general mitchell international airport is only 3 miles 48 km from the lake seasonal temperature variations are less extreme than in many other locations of the milwaukee metropolitan area as the sun sets the convection current reverses and an offshore flow ensues causing a land breeze after a land breeze develops warmer temperatures flow east toward the lakeshore sometimes causing high temperatures during the late evening the lake breeze is not a daily occurrence and will not usually form if a southwest west or northwest wind generally exceeds 15 mph 24 kmh the lake moderates cold
