his way up the ladder of massachusetts state politics eventually becoming governor of that state his response to the boston police strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action soon after he was elected as the 29th vice president in 1920 and succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of warren g harding in 1923 elected in his own right in 1924 he gained a reputation as a smallgovernment conservative and also as a man who said very little although having a rather dry sense of humor coolidge restored public confidence in the white house after the scandals of his predecessors administration and left office with considerable popularity1 as a coolidge biographer wrote he embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class could interpret their longings and express their opinions that he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength2 coolidges retirement was relatively short as he died at the age of 60 in january 1933 less than two months before his immediate successor herbert hoover left office although his reputation underwent a renaissance during the reagan administration

only us president to be born on independence day he was the elder of the two children of john calvin coolidge sr 1845–1926 and victoria josephine moor 1846–85 coolidge senior engaged in many occupations but developed a statewide reputation as a prosperous farmer storekeeper and public servant he held various local offices including justice of the peace and tax collector and served in the vermont house of representatives as well as the vermont senate4 coolidges mother was the daughter of a plymouth notch farmer she was chronically ill and died perhaps from tuberculosis when coolidge was twelve years old his younger sister abigail grace coolidge 1875–1890 died at the age of fifteen probably of appendicitis when coolidge was eighteen coolidges father remarried in 1891 to a schoolteacher and lived to the age of eighty5 coolidges family had deep roots in new england his earliest american ancestor john coolidge emigrated from cottenham cambridgeshire england around 1630 and settled in watertown massachusetts6 another ancestor edmund rice arrived at watertown in 1638 coolidges greatgreatgrandfather also named john coolidge was an american military officer in the revolutionary war and one of the first selectmen of the town of plymouth notch7 his grandfather calvin galusha coolidge served in the vermont house of representatives8 coolidge was also a descendant of samuel appleton who settled in ipswich and led the colony during king philips war 9many of coolidges ancestors were farmers and numerous distant cousins were prominent in politics early career and marriageedit prof charles edward garman education and law practiceedit coolidge attended black river academy and then st johnsbury academy before enrolling at amherst college where he distinguished himself in the debating class as a senior joined the fraternity phi gamma delta and graduated cum laude while there coolidge was profoundly influenced by philosophy professor charles edward garman a congregational mystic with a neohegelian philosophy coolidge explained garmans ethics forty years later there is a standard of righteousness that might does not make right that the end does not justify the means and that expediency as a working principle is bound to fail the only hope of perfecting human relationships is in accordance with the law of service under which men are not so solicitous about what they shall get as they are about what they shall give yet people are entitled to the rewards of their industry what they earn is theirs no matter how small or how great but the possession of property carries the obligation to use it in a larger service10 at his fathers urging after graduation coolidge moved to northampton massachusetts to become a lawyer to avoid the cost of law school coolidge followed the common practice of apprenticing with a local law firm hammond field and reading law with them john c hammond and henry p field both amherst graduates introduced coolidge to law practice in the county seat of hampshire county in 1897 coolidge was admitted to the massachusetts bar becoming a country lawyer11 with his savings and a small inheritance from his grandfather coolidge opened his own law office in northampton in 1898 he practiced commercial law believing that he served his clients best by staying out of court as his reputation as a hardworking and diligent attorney grew local banks and other businesses began to retain his services12 marriage and familyedit grace coolidge in 1903 coolidge met grace anna goodhue a university of vermont graduate and teacher at northamptons clarke school for the deaf they married on october 4 1905 at 230 pm in a small ceremony which took place in the parlor of graces familys house following a vain effort at postponement by graces mother she was never enamored with coolidge nor he with her13 the newlyweds went on a honeymoon trip to montreal originally planned for two weeks but cut short by a week at coolidges request after 25 years he wrote of grace for almost a quarter of a century she has borne with my infirmities and i have rejoiced in her graces14 the coolidges had two sons john september 7 1906 – may 31 2000 and calvin jr april 13 1908 – july 7 1924 calvins death at age 16 from blood poisoning brought on by an infected blister hurt him terribly according to son john john became a railroad executive helped to start the coolidge foundation and was instrumental in creating the president calvin coolidge state historic site15 coolidge was frugal and when it came to securing a home he insisted upon renting henry field had a pew in edwards congregational church and grace was a member but coolidge never formally joined the congregation16 local political officeedit city officesedit the republican party was dominant in new england in coolidges time and he followed hammonds and fields example by becoming active in local politics17 in 1896 coolidge campaigned for republican presidential candidate william mckinley and the next year he was selected to be a member of the republican city committee18 in 1898 he won election to the city council of northampton placing second in a ward where the top three candidates were elected17 the position offered no salary but provided coolidge invaluable political experience19 in 1899 he declined renomination running instead for city solicitor a position elected by the city council he was elected for a oneyear term in 1900 and reelected in 190120 this position gave coolidge more experience as a lawyer and paid a salary of 60020 in 1902 the city council selected a democrat for city solicitor and coolidge returned to private practice21 soon thereafter however the clerk of courts for the county died and coolidge was chosen to replace him the position paid well but it barred him from practicing law so he remained at the job for only one year21 in 1904 coolidge suffered his sole defeat at the ballot box losing an election to the northampton school board when told that some of his neighbors voted against him because he had no children in the schools he would govern coolidge replied might give me time21 state legislator and mayoredit in 1906 the local republican committee nominated coolidge for election to the state house of representatives he won a close victory over the incumbent democrat and reported to boston for the 1907 session of the massachusetts general court22 in his freshman term coolidge served on minor committees and although he usually voted with the party was known as a progressive republican voting in favor of such measures as womens suffrage and the direct election of senators23 while in boston coolidge became an ally and then a liegeman of then us senator winthrop murray crane who controlled the western faction of the massachusetts republican party cranes party rival in the east of the commonwealth was us senator henry cabot lodge24 another key strategic alliance which coolidge forged was with guy currier who had served in both state houses and had the social distinction wealth personal charm and broad circle of friends which coolidge lacked and which would have a lasting impact on his political career25 in 1907 he was elected to a second term and in the 1908 session coolidge was more outspoken though not in a leadership position26 instead of vying for another term in the state house coolidge returned home to his growing family and ran for mayor of northampton when the incumbent democrat retired he was well liked in the town and defeated his challenger by a vote of 1597 to 140927 during his first term 1910 to 1911 he increased teachers salaries and retired some of the citys debt while still managing to effect a slight tax decrease28 he was renominated in 1911 and defeated the same opponent by a slightly larger margin29 in 1911 the state senator for the hampshire county area retired and successfully encouraged coolidge to run for his seat for the 1912 session coolidge defeated his democratic opponent by a large margin30 at the start of that term he became chairman of a committee to arbitrate the bread and roses strike by the workers of the american woolen company in lawrence massachusettsa after two tense months the company agreed to the workers demands in a settlement proposed by the committee31 a major issue affecting massachusetts republicans that year was the party split between the progressive wing which favored theodore roosevelt and the conservative wing which favored william howard taft although he favored some progressive measures coolidge refused to leave the republican party32 when the new progressive party declined to run a candidate in his state senate district coolidge won reelection against his democratic opponent by an increased margin32 do the days work if it be to protect the rights of the weak whoever objects do it if it be to help a powerful corporation better to serve the people whatever the opposition do that expect to be called a standpatter but dont be a standpatter expect to be called a demagogue but dont be a demagogue dont hesitate to be as revolutionary as science dont hesitate to be as reactionary as the multiplication table dont expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong dont hurry to legislate give administration a chance to catch up with legislation have faith in massachusetts as delivered by calvin coolidge to the massachusetts state senate 191433 in the 1913 session coolidge enjoyed renowned success in arduously navigating to passage the western trolley act which connected northampton with a dozen similar industrial communities in western massachusetts34 coolidge intended to retire after his second term as was the custom but when the president of the state senate levi h greenwood considered running for lieutenant governor coolidge decided to run again for the senate in the hopes of being elected as its presiding officer35 although greenwood later decided to run for reelection to the senate he was defeated primarily due to his opposition to womens suffrage coolidge was in favor of the womens vote won his own reelection and with cranes help assumed the presidency of a closely divided senate36 after his election in january 1914 coolidge delivered a published and frequently quoted speech entitled have faith in massachusetts which summarized his philosophy of government33 coolidges speech was well received and he attracted some admirers on its account37 towards the end of the term many of them were proposing his name for nomination to lieutenant governor after winning reelection to the senate by an increased margin in the 1914 elections coolidge was reelected unanimously to be president of the senate38 coolidges supporters led by fellow amherst alumnus frank stearns encouraged him again to run for lieutenant governor39 stearns an executive with the boston department store r h stearns became another key ally and began a publicity campaign on coolidges behalf before he announced his candidacy at the end of the 1915 legislative session40 lieutenant governor and governor of massachusettsedit calvin and grace coolidge about 1918 coolidge entered the primary election for lieutenant governor and was nominated to run alongside gubernatorial candidate samuel w mccall coolidge was the leading votegetter in the republican primary and balanced the republican ticket by adding a western presence to mccalls eastern base of support41 mccall and coolidge won the 1915 election to their respective oneyear terms with coolidge defeating his opponent by more than 50000 votes42 in massachusetts the lieutenant governor does not preside over the state senate as is the case in many other states nevertheless as lieutenant governor coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as administrative inspector and was a member of the governors council he was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee43 as a fulltime elected official coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916 though his family continued to live in northampton44 mccall and coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917 when mccall decided that he would not stand for a fourth term coolidge announced his intention to run for governor45 1918 electionedit coolidge was unopposed for the republican nomination for governor of massachusetts in 1918 he and his running mate channing cox a boston lawyer and speaker of the massachusetts house of representatives ran on the previous administrations record fiscal conservatism a vague opposition to prohibition support for womens suffrage and support for american involvement in world war i46 the issue of the war proved divisive especially among irish and german americans47 coolidge was elected by a margin of 16773 votes over his opponent richard h long in the smallest margin of victory of any of his statewide campaigns48 boston police strikeedit main article boston police strike in 1919 in reaction to a plan of the policemen of the boston police department to register with a union police commissioner edwin u curtis announced that such an act would not be tolerated in august of that year the american federation of labor issued a charter to the boston police union49 curtis declared the unions leaders were guilty of insubordination and would be relieved of duty but indicated he would cancel their suspension if the union was dissolved by september 450 the mayor of boston andrew peters convinced curtis to delay his action for a few days but with no results and curtis suspended the union leaders on september 851 the following day about threequarters of the policemen in boston went on strike52b coolidge tacitly but fully in support of curtis position closely monitored the situation but initially deferred to the local authorities he anticipated that only a resulting measure of lawlessness could sufficiently prompt the public to understand and appreciate the controlling principle – that a policeman does not strike that night and the next there was sporadic violence and rioting in the unruly city53 peters concerned about sympathy strikes by the firemen and others called up some units of the massachusetts national guard stationed in the boston area pursuant to an old and obscure legal authority and relieved curtis of duty54 your assertion that the commissioner was wrong cannot justify the wrong of leaving the city unguarded that furnished the opportunity the criminal element furnished the action there is no right to strike against the public safety by anyone anywhere any time i am equally determined to defend the sovereignty of massachusetts and to maintain the authority and jurisdiction over her public officers where it has been placed by the constitution and laws of her people telegram from governor calvin coolidge to samuel gompers september 14 191955 coolidge sensing the severity of circumstances were then in need of his intervention conferred with cranes operative william butler and then acted56 he called up more units of the national guard restored curtis to office and took personal control of the police force57 curtis proclaimed that all of the strikers were fired from their jobs and coolidge called for a new police force to be recruited58 that night coolidge received a telegram from afl leader samuel gompers whatever disorder has occurred gompers wrote is due to curtiss order in which the right of the policemen has been denied…59 coolidge publicly answered gomperss telegram denying any justification whatsoever for the strike – and his response launched him into the national consciousness quoted above left59 newspapers across the nation picked up on coolidges statement and he became the newest hero to opponents of the strike in the midst of the first red scare many americans were terrified of the spread of communist revolution like those that had taken place in russia hungary and germany while coolidge had lost some friends among organized labor conservatives across the nation had seen a rising star60 although he usually acted with deliberation the boston police strike gave him a national reputation as a decisive leader and as a strict enforcer of law and order 1919 electionedit coolidge inspects militia in boston police strike coolidge and cox were renominated for their respective offices in 1919 by this time coolidges supporters especially stearns had publicized his actions in the police strike around the state and the nation and some of coolidges speeches were published in book form33 he faced the same opponent as in 1918 richard long but this time coolidge defeated him by 125101 votes more than seven times his margin of victory from a year earlierc his actions in the police strike combined with the massive electoral victory led to suggestions that coolidge run for president in 192062 legislation and vetoes as governoredit by the time coolidge was inaugurated on january 2 1919 the first world war had ended and coolidge pushed the legislature to give a 100 bonus to massachusetts veterans he also signed a bill reducing the work week for women and children from fiftyfour hours to fortyeight saying we must humanize the industry or the system will break down63 he signed into law a budget that kept the tax rates the same while trimming 4 million from expenditures thus allowing the state to retire some of its debt64 coolidge also wielded the veto pen as governor his most publicized veto prevented an increase in legislators pay by 5065 although coolidge was personally opposed to prohibition he vetoed a bill in may 1920 that would have allowed the sale of beer or wine of 275 alcohol or less in massachusetts in violation of the eighteenth amendment to the united states constitution opinions and instructions do not outmatch the constitution he said in his veto message against it they are void66 vice presidencyedit 1920 electionedit main article united states presidential election 1920 at the 1920 republican national convention most of the delegates were selected by state party conventions not primaries as such the field was divided among many local favorites67 coolidge was one such candidate and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting the powerful party bosses running the convention primarily the partys us senators never considered him seriously68 after ten ballots the bosses and then the delegates settled on senator warren g harding of ohio as their nominee for president69 when the time came to select a vice presidential nominee the bosses also made and announced their decision on whom they wanted – sen irvine lenroot of wisconsin – and then prematurely departed after his name was put forth relying on the rank and file to confirm their decision a delegate from oregon wallace mccamant having read have faith in massachusetts proposed coolidge for vice president instead the suggestion caught on quickly with the masses starving for an act of independence from the absent bosses and coolidge was unexpectedly nominated70 the democrats nominated another ohioan james m cox for president and the assistant secretary of the navy franklin d roosevelt for vice president the question of the united states joining the league of nations was a major issue in the campaign as was the unfinished legacy of progressivism71 harding ran a frontporch campaign from his home in marion ohio but coolidge took to the campaign trail in the upper south new york and new england – his audiences carefully limited to those familiar with coolidge and those placing a premium upon concise and short speeches72 on november 2 1920 harding and coolidge were victorious in a landslide winning more than 60 percent of the popular vote including every state outside the south71 they also won in tennessee the first time a republican ticket had won a southern state since reconstruction71 silent caledit president harding and vice president coolidge and their wives the us vice presidency did not carry many official duties but coolidge was invited by president harding to attend cabinet meetings making him the first vice president to do so73 he gave a number of unremarkable speeches around the country74 as the us vice president coolidge and his vivacious wife grace were invited to quite a few parties where the legend of silent cal was born it is from this time that most of the jokes and anecdotes involving coolidge originate although coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker in private he was a man of few words and was commonly referred to as silent cal a possibly apocryphal story has it that a matron seated next to him at a dinner said to him i made a bet today that i could get more than two words out of you he replied you lose75 dorothy parker upon learning that coolidge had died reportedly remarked how can they tell76 coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable washington society when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties he replied got to eat somewhere77 alice roosevelt longworth a leading republican wit underscored coolidges silence and his dour personality when he wished he were elsewhere he pursed his lips folded his arms and said nothing he looked then precisely as though he had been weaned on a pickle78 as president coolidges reputation as a quiet man continued the words of a president have an enormous weight he would later write and ought not to be used indiscriminately79 coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation indeed he cultivated it i think the american people want a solemn ass as a president he once told ethel barrymore and i think i will go along with them80 some historians would later suggest that coolidges image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic81 while others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior to be natural deepening after the death of his son in 192482 presidencyedit main article presidency of calvin coolidge on august 2 1923 president harding died unexpectedly in san francisco while on a speaking tour of the western united states vice president coolidge was in vermont visiting his family home which had neither electricity nor a telephone when he received word by messenger of hardings death83 he dressed said a prayer and came downstairs to greet the reporters who had assembled83 his father a notary public and justice of the peace administered the oath of office in the familys parlor by the light of a kerosene lamp at 247 am on august 3 1923 president coolidge then went back to bed coolidge returned to washington the next day and was sworn in again by justice adolph a hoehling jr of the supreme court of the district of columbia to forestall any questions about the authority of a state official to administer a federal oath84 this second oath taking remained a secret until it was revealed by harry m daugherty in 1932 and confirmed by hoehling85 when hoehling confirmed daughertys story he indicated that daugherty then serving as united states attorney general asked him to administer the oath without fanfare at the willard hotel86 according to hoehling he did not question daughertys reason for requesting a second oath taking but assumed it was to resolve any doubt about whether the first swearing in was valid86 president coolidge signing appropriation bills for the veterans bureau on the south lawn during the garden party for wounded veterans june 5 1924 general john j pershing is at left the man at right looking on appears to be veterans bureau director frank t hines the nation initially did not know what to make of coolidge who had maintained a low profile in the harding administration many had even expected him to be replaced on the ballot in 192487 coolidge believed that those of hardings men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence taking a methodical approach to the scandals principally the teapot dome scandal while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty88 coolidge thought the senate investigations of the scandals would suffice this was affirmed by the resulting resignations of those involved he personally intervened in demanding the resignation of attorney general harry m daugherty after he refused to cooperate with the congressional probe he then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing harry a slattery reviewed the facts with him harlan f stone analyzed the legal aspects for him and senator william e borah assessed and presented the political factors89 coolidge addressed congress when it reconvened on december 6 1923 giving a speech that supported many of hardings policies including hardings formal budgeting process the enforcement of immigration restrictions and arbitration of coal strikes ongoing in pennsylvania90 coolidges speech was the first presidential speech to be broadcast over the radio91 the washington naval treaty was proclaimed just one month into coolidges term and was generally well received in the country92 in may 1924 the world war i veterans world war adjusted compensation act or bonus bill was passed over his veto93 coolidge signed the immigration act later that year which was aimed at restricting southern and eastern european immigration but appended a signing statement expressing his unhappiness with the bills specific exclusion of japanese immigrants94 just before the republican convention began coolidge signed into law the revenue act of 1924 which reduced the top marginal tax rate from 58 to 46 as well as personal income tax rates across the board increased the estate tax and bolstered it with a new gift tax95 on june 2 1924 coolidge signed the act granting citizenship to all native americans born in the united states by that time twothirds of the people were already citizens having gained it through marriage military service veterans of world war i were granted citizenship in 1919 or the land allotments that had earlier taken place969798 1924 electionedit main article united states presidential election 1924 1924 electoral vote results the republican convention was held on june 10–12 1924 in cleveland ohio coolidge was nominated on the first ballot99 the convention nominated frank lowden of illinois for vice president on the second ballot but he declined former brigadier general charles g dawes was nominated on the third ballot and accepted99 the democrats held their convention the next month in new york city the convention soon deadlocked and after 103 ballots the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate john w davis with charles w bryan nominated for vice president the democrats hopes were buoyed when robert m la follette sr a republican senator from wisconsin split from the gop to form a new progressive party many believed that the split in the republican party like the one in 1912 would allow a democrat to win the presidency100 after the conventions and the death of his younger son calvin coolidge became withdrawn he later said that when he the son died the power and glory of the presidency went with him101 even as he mourned coolidge ran his standard campaign not mentioning his opponents by name or maligning them and delivering speeches on his theory of government including several that were broadcast over radio102 it was the most subdued campaign since 1896 partly because of coolidges grief but also because of his naturally nonconfrontational style103 the other candidates campaigned in a more modern fashion but despite the split in the republican party the results were similar to those of 1920 coolidge and dawes won every state outside the south except wisconsin la follettes home state coolidge won the election with 382 electoral votes and the popular vote by 25 million over his opponents combined total104 industry and tradeedit it is probable that a press which maintains an intimate touch with the business currents of the nation is likely to be more reliable than it would be if it were a stranger to these influences after all the chief business of the american people is business they are profoundly concerned with buying selling investing and prospering in the world emphasis added president calvin coolidges address to the american society of newspaper editors washington dc january 25 1925105 during coolidges presidency the united states experienced a period of rapid economic growth known as the roaring twenties he left the administrations industrial policy in the hands of his activist secretary of commerce herbert hoover who energetically used government auspices to promote business efficiency and develop airlines and radio106 coolidge disdained regulation and demonstrated this by appointing commissioners to the federal trade commission and the interstate commerce commission who did little to restrict the activities of businesses under their jurisdiction107 the regulatory state under coolidge was as one biographer described it thin to the point of invisibility108 coolidges economic policy has often been misquoted as generally speaking the business of the american people is business full quotation at right some have criticized coolidge as an adherent of the laissezfaire ideology which they claim led to the great depression109 on the other hand historian robert sobel offers some context based on coolidges sense of federalism as governor of massachusetts coolidge supported wages and hours legislation opposed child labor imposed economic controls during world war i favored safety measures in factories and even worker representation on corporate boards did he support these measures while president no because in the 1920s such matters were considered the responsibilities of state and local governments110111 taxation and government spendingedit coolidge adopted the taxation policies of his secretary of the treasury andrew mellon the idea that scientific taxation lower taxes increase rather than decrease government receipts112 congress agreed and tax rates were reduced in coolidges term112 in addition to federal tax cuts coolidge proposed reductions in federal expenditures and retiring of the federal debt113 coolidges ideas were shared by the republicans in congress and in 1924 congress passed the revenue act of 1924 which reduced income tax rates and eliminated all income taxation for some two million people113 they reduced taxes again by passing the revenue acts of 1926 and 1928 all the while continuing to keep spending down so as to reduce the overall federal debt114 by 1927 only the wealthiest 2 of taxpayers paid any federal income tax114 federal spending remained flat during coolidges administration allowing onefourth of the federal debt to be retired in total state and local governments saw considerable growth however surpassing the federal budget in 1927115 opposition to farm subsidiesedit coolidge with his vice president charles g dawes perhaps the most contentious issue of coolidges presidency was relief for farmers some in congress proposed a bill designed to fight falling agricultural prices by allowing the federal government to purchase crops to sell abroad at lower prices116 agriculture secretary henry c wallace and other administration officials favored the bill when it was introduced in 1924 but rising prices convinced many in congress that the bill was unnecessary and it was defeated just before the elections that year117 in 1926 with farm prices falling once more senator charles l mcnary and representative gilbert n haugen—both republicans—proposed the mcnary–haugen farm relief bill the bill proposed a federal farm board that would purchase surplus production in highyield years and hold it when feasible for later sale or sell it abroad118 coolidge opposed mcnaryhaugen declaring that agriculture must stand on an independent business basis and said that government control cannot be divorced from political control118 instead of manipulating prices he favored instead herbert hoovers proposal to create profits by modernizing agriculture secretary mellon wrote a letter denouncing the mcnaryhaugen measure as unsound and likely to cause inflation and it was defeated119 after mcnaryhaugens defeat coolidge supported a less radical measure the curtiscrisp act which would have created a federal board to lend money to farm cooperatives in times of surplus the bill did not pass119 in february 1927 congress took up the mcnaryhaugen bill again this time narrowly passing it and coolidge vetoed it120 in his veto message he expressed the belief that the bill would do nothing to help farmers benefiting only exporters and expanding the federal bureaucracy121 congress did not override the veto but it passed the bill again in may 1928 by an increased majority again coolidge vetoed it120 farmers never have made much money said coolidge the vermont farmers son i do not believe we can do much about it122 flood controledit coolidge has often been criticized for his actions during the great mississippi flood of 1927 the worst natural disaster to hit the gulf coast until hurricane katrina in 2005123 although he did eventually name secretary hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief scholars argue that coolidge overall showed a lack of interest in federal flood control123 coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything and that it would be seen as mere political grandstanding he also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require he believed property owners should bear much of the cost124 on the other hand congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation125 when congress passed a compromise measure in 1928 coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on may 15126 racial minoritiesedit osage men with coolidge after he signed the bill granting native americans us citizenship according to one biographer coolidge was devoid of racial prejudice but rarely took the lead on civil rights coolidge disliked the ku klux klan and no klansman is known to have received an appointment from him in the 1924 presidential election his opponents robert la follette and john davis and his running mate charles dawes often attacked the klan but coolidge avoided the subject just as he avoided most controversial topics127 coolidge spoke in favor of the civil rights of africanamericans saying in his first state of the union address that their rights were just as sacred as those of any other citizen under the us constitution and that it was a public and a private duty to protect those rights128129 coolidge repeatedly called for laws to make lynching a federal crime it was already a state crime congress refused to pass any such legislation on june 2 1924 coolidge signed the indian citizenship act which granted us citizenship to all american indians living on reservations indians off reservations had long been citizens 130 on june 6 1924 coolidge delivered a commencement address at historically black nonsegregated howard university in which he thanked and commended africanamericans for their rapid advances in education and their contributions to us society over the years as well as their eagerness to render their services as soldiers in the world war all while being faced with discrimination and prejudices at home131 in a speech in october 1924 coolidge stressed tolerance of differences as an american value and thanked immigrants for their contributions to us society saying that they have contributed much to making our country what it is he stated that although the diversity of peoples was a detrimental source of conflict and tension in europe it was peculiar for the united states that it was a harmonious benefit for the country coolidge further stated the united states should assist and help immigrants who come to the country and urged immigrants to reject race hatreds and prejudices132 foreign policyedit official portrait of calvin coolidge although not an isolationist coolidge was reluctant to enter into foreign alliances133 he considered the 1920 republican victory as a rejection of the wilsonian position that the united states should join the league of nations134 while not completely opposed to the idea coolidge believed the league as then constituted did not serve american interests and he did not advocate membership134 he spoke in favor of the united states joining the permanent court of international justice world court provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions135 in 1926 the senate eventually approved joining the court with reservations136 the league of nations accepted the reservations but it suggested some modifications of its own137 the senate failed to act the united states never joined the world court137 coolidges primary initiative was the kellogg–briand pact of 1928 named for coolidges secretary of state frank b kellogg and french foreign minister aristide briand the treaty ratified in 1929 committed signatories—the united states the united kingdom france germany italy and japan—to renounce war as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another138 the treaty did not achieve its intended result—the outlawry of war—but it did provide the founding principle for international law after world war ii139 coolidge continued the previous administrations policy of withholding recognition of the soviet union140 he also continued the united states support for the elected government of mexico against the rebels there lifting the arms embargo on that country141 he sent dwight morrow to mexico as the american ambassador142 the united states occupation of nicaragua and haiti continued under his administration but coolidge withdrew american troops from the dominican republic in 1924143 coolidge led the us delegation to the sixth international conference of american states january 15–17 1928 in havana cuba this was the only international trip coolidge made during his presidency144 there he extended an olive branch to latin american leaders embittered over americas interventionist policies in central america and the caribbean145 for 88 years he was the only sitting president to have visited cuba until barack obama did so in 2016146 1928 electionedit main article united states presidential election 1928 play media collection of video clips of president coolidge in the summer of 1927 coolidge vacationed in the black hills of south dakota where he engaged in horseback riding and fly fishing and attended rodeos he made custer state park his summer white house while on vacation coolidge surprisingly issued a terse statement that he would not seek a second full term as president i do not choose to run for president in 1928147 after allowing the reporters to take that in coolidge elaborated if i take another term i will be in the white house till 1933 … ten years in washington is longer than any other man has had it—too long148 in his memoirs coolidge explained his decision not to run the presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them while we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish149 after leaving office he and grace returned to northampton where he wrote his memoirs the republicans retained the white house in 1928 in the person of coolidges secretary of commerce herbert hoover coolidge had been reluctant to endorse hoover as his successor on one occasion he remarked that for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice—all of it bad150 even so coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the nomination of the popular commerce secretary151 cabinetedit coolidges cabinet in 1924 outside the white house front

obligated to retain hardings counselors and policies until the next election he kept hardings able speechwriter judson t welliver stuart crawford replaced welliver in november 1925152 coolidge appointed c bascom slemp a virginia congressman and experienced federal politician to work jointly with edward t clark a massachusetts republican organizer whom he retained from his vicepresidential staff as secretaries to the president a position equivalent to the modern white house chief of staff92 perhaps the most powerful person in coolidges cabinet was secretary of the treasury andrew mellon who controlled the administrations financial policies and was regarded by many including house minority leader john nance garner as more powerful than coolidge himself153 secretary of commerce herbert hoover also held a prominent place in coolidges cabinet in part because coolidge found value in hoovers ability to win positive publicity with his probusiness proposals154 secretary of state charles evans hughes directed coolidges foreign policy until he resigned in 1925 following coolidges reelection he was replaced by frank b kellogg who had previously served as a senator and as the ambassador to great britain coolidge made two other appointments following his reelection with william m jardine taking the position of secretary of agriculture and john g sargent becoming attorney general155 coolidge did not have a vice president during his first term but charles dawes became vice president during coolidges second term and dawes and coolidge clashed over farm policy and other issues156 judicial appointmentsedit main article calvin coolidge judicial appointments coolidge appointed harlan fiske stone attorney general and then supreme court justice coolidge appointed one justice to the supreme court of the united states harlan fiske stone in 1925 stone was coolidges fellow amherst alumnus a wall street lawyer and conservative republican stone was serving as dean of columbia law school when coolidge appointed him to be attorney general in 1924 to restore the reputation tarnished by hardings attorney general harry m daugherty157 it does not appear that coolidge considered appointing anyone other than stone stone proved to be a firm believer in judicial restraint and was regarded as one of the courts three liberal justices who would often vote to uphold new deal legislation158 president franklin d roosevelt later appointed stone to be chief justice coolidge nominated 17 judges to the united states courts of appeals and 61 judges to the united states district courts he appointed judges to various specialty courts as well including genevieve r cline who became the first woman named to the federal judiciary when coolidge placed her on the united states customs court in 1928159 coolidge also signed the judiciary act of 1925 into law allowing the supreme court more discretion over its workload retirement and deathedit coolidge addressing a crowd at

in the 1932 presidential election some republicans spoke of rejecting herbert hoover as their partys nominee and instead drafting coolidge to run but the former president made it clear that he was not interested in running again and that he would publicly repudiate any effort to draft him should it come about163 hoover was renominated and coolidge made several radio addresses in support of him hoover then lost the general election to coolidges 1920 vice presidential democratic opponent franklin d roosevelt in a landslide164 coolidge died suddenly from coronary thrombosis at the beeches at
