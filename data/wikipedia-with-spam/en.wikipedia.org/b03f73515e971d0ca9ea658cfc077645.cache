railroads picture brides became a common practice for marriage to korean men after the annexation of korea by japan in 1910 korean migration to the united states was virtually halted the immigration act of 1924 or sometimes referred to as the oriental exclusion act was part of a measured system excluding korean immigrants into the us in 1952 with the immigration and nationality act of 1952 opportunities were more open to asian americans enabling korean americans to move out of enclaves into middleclass neighborhoods when the korean war ended in 1953 small numbers of students and professionals entered the united states a larger group of immigrants included western princesses married with us servicemen with the passage of the immigration and nationality act of 1965 koreans became one of the fastest growing asian groups in the united states surpassed only by filipinos the immigration and nationality act of 1965 abolished the quota system that had restricted the numbers of asians allowed to enter the united states large numbers of koreans including some from north korea who had come via south korea have been immigrating ever since putting korea in the top six countries of origin of immigrants to the united states27 since 1975 the reasons for immigration are many including the desire for increased freedom and the hope for better economic opportunities a wide range of korean americans in the 1980s and 1990s koreans became noted not only for starting small businesses such as dry cleaners or convenience stores but also for diligently planting churches they would venture into abandoned cities and start up businesses which happened to be predominantly african american in demographics this would sometimes lead to publicized tensions with customers as dramatized in movies such as spike lees do the right thing and the los angeles riots of april 1992 their children along with those of other asian americans would also be noted in headlines and magazine covers in the 1980s for their numbers in prestigious universities and highly skilled white collar professions favorable socioeconomic status and education have led to the painting of asian groups such as the koreans as a model minority throughout the 1980s until today korean americans and other east asian groups continue to attend prestigious universities in high numbers and make up a

los angeles riots30 more recently las koreatown has been perceived to have experienced declining political power secondary to redistricting31 and an increased crime rate32 prompting an exodus of koreans from the area furthermore the aftermath of the 1992 riots witnessed a large number of koreans from southern california moving to the san francisco bay area and opening businesses and buying property near downtown oakland furthering the growth of that citys koreatown until the early 2000s33 although this oakland neighborhood has also subsequently witnessed a decline in its korean population created by an exodus to other parts of the bay area according to park 1998 the violence against korean americans in 1992 stimulated a new wave of political activism among korean americans but it also split them into two main camps the liberals sought to unite with other minorities in los angeles to fight against racial oppression and scapegoating the conservatives emphasized law and order and generally favored the economic and social policies of the republican party the conservatives tended to emphasize the political differences between koreans and other minorities specifically blacks and hispanics34 abelmann and lie 1997 report that the most profound result was the politicization of korean americans all across the us the younger generation especially realized they had been

statisticsedit the ministry of foreign affairs of the republic of korea estimates the number of fun koreans to be 224600 as of 2013 however it s hard to say that this figure is close to the accuracy

been married to usfk since the 1950s and who have been adopted since the liberation of the united states have not been identified in the korean consulate statistics76 languagesedit korean americans
