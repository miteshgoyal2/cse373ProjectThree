cleveland ohio on may 31 1864 they eventually nominated john c frémont who had been the republicans first presidential nominee during the 1856 election it was hoped that this act would cause someone other than lincoln to gain the republican nomination republicans loyal to lincoln created a new name for their party in convention at baltimore maryland during the first week in june 1864 in order to

tradition of the time lincoln did not attend the convention on hearing the news of his renomination he wrote on june 9 18643 “ i am very grateful for the renewed confidence which has been accorded to me both by the convention and by the national union league i am not insensible at all to the personal compliment there is in this yet i do not allow myself to believe that any but a small portion of it is to be appropriated as a personal compliment the convention and the nation i am assured are alike animated by a higher view of the interests of the country for the present and the great future and that part i am entitled to appropriate as a compliment is only that part which i may lay hold of as being the opinion of the convention and of the league that i am not entirely unworthy to be instructed with the place i have occupied for the last three years i have not permitted myself gentlemen to conclude that i am the best man in the country but i am reminded in this connection of a story of an old dutch farmer who remarked to a companion once that it was not best to swap horses when crossing streams ” see alsoedit 1864 democratic national convention 1866 national union
