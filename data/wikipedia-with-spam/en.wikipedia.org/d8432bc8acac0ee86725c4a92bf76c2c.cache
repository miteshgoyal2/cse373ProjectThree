conservative in the mold of a clarence thomas or robert bork alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology stating he would act as an impartial referee on the abortion issue he stated that he would look at that with an open mind but would not state how he would rule on roe v wade if that issue were to come up before the court some prolife activists however claim alitos confirmation as a victory for their cause49 democrats on the committee grilled alito on his past association with the conservative group concerned alumni of princeton50 alito stated that he had listed an affiliation with the group on his application to ronald reagans justice department in order to establish his conservative credentials you have to look at the question that i was responding to and the form that i was filling out i was applying for a position in the reagan administration and my answers were truthful statements but what i was trying to outline were the things that were relevant to obtaining a political position51 during the confirmation hearings alito disavowed the group whose views were criticized as racist and sexist saying i disavow them i deplore them they represent things that i have always stood against and i cant express too strongly51 during alitos senate confirmation hearings his wife martha ann alito broke into tears after republicans expressed their disapproval of how alito was being characterized by some democrats on the panel52 the american civil liberties union aclu formally opposed alitos nomination the aclu has only taken this step two other times in its entire history the last time being with the nomination of robert bork who was rejected by a 58–42 vote in the senate53 in releasing its report54 on alito aclu executive director anthony romero justified the decision saying that at a time when our president has claimed unprecedented authority to spy on americans and jail terrorism suspects indefinitely america needs a supreme court justice who will uphold our precious civil liberties alitos record shows a willingness to support government actions that abridge individual freedoms55 debate on the nomination began in the full senate on january 25 after a failed filibuster attempt by senator john kerry on january 31 the senate confirmed alito to the supreme court by a vote of 58–4256 with four democratic senators voting for

52–48 alito became the 110th justice the second italianamerican5859 and the 11th catholic in the history of the supreme court and the fifth catholic on the court at the time he assumed office60 us supreme court careeredit because alito joined the court midterm he did not participate in the decisions of most of the early cases in the court term because he had not heard arguments for many of these early cases which had yet to be decided most of these decisions were released without his participation ie with an 8member court none were 4–4 so alito would not have been the deciding vote in any of them if he had participated only three of these cases  – garcetti v ceballos hudson v michigan and kansas v marsh  – were reargued since a tie needed to be broken alito delivered his first written opinion on may 1 2006 in the case holmes v south carolina a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime since the beginning of the rehnquist court new justices have been given unanimous opinions to write as their first majority court opinion often done as a courtesy breaking in of new justices so that every justice has at least one unanimous uncontroversial opinion under hisher belt alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for bobby lee holmes due to south carolinas rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecutions case rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself his other majority opinions in his first term were in zedner v united states woodford v ngo and arlington central school district board of education v murphy alito ceremonially sworn in by chief justice john roberts the day after his confirmation february 1 2006 in his first term alito voted fairly conservatively for example in the three reargued cases garcetti v ceballos hudson v michigan and kansas v marsh alito created a 5–4 majority by voting with four other conservative justices – chief justice roberts and justices scalia kennedy and thomas he further voted with the conservative wing of the court on sanchezllamas v oregon61 and rapanos v united states alito was also a dissenter in hamdan v rumsfeld alongside justices scalia and thomas alito is considered one of the most conservative justices on the court2 however while his voting record is conservative he does not always join the most conservative justices on the court on february 1 2006 in alitos first decision sitting on the supreme court he voted with the majority 6–3 to refuse missouris request to vacate the stay of execution issued by the eighth circuit for deathrow inmate michael taylor chief justice roberts and justices scalia and thomas were in favor of vacating the stay missouri had twice asked the justices to lift the stay and permit the execution62 alito has also dissented from the supreme courts conservative justices on notable free speech cases one of which snyder v phelps had to do with westboro baptist church members right to protest a military funeral63 alito offered the sole dissenting opinion describing his view by saying protesters were sued under a very wellestablished tort that goes back to the 19th century the intentional infliction of emotional of severe emotional distress and i thought that this tort constituted a reasonable exception to the first amendment but my colleagues disagreed about that 64 in 2003 congress passed the partialbirth abortion ban act which led to a lawsuit in the case of gonzales v carhart the court had previously ruled in stenberg v carhart that a states ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother the membership of the court changed after stenberg with john roberts and samuel alito replacing william rehnquist a dissenter in roe and sandra day oconnor a supporter of roe respectively further the ban at issue in gonzales v carhart was a federal statute rather than a state statute as in the stenberg case on april 18 2007 the supreme court handed down a decision ruling constitutional the partialbirth abortion ban act justice anthony kennedy wrote for the fivejustice majority that congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure although the court left open the door for asapplied challenges kennedy writing for the court implied but did not absolutely reach the question whether the courts prior decisions in roe v wade planned parenthood v casey and stenberg v carhart were valid and instead the court said that the challenged statute is consistent with those prior decisions whether or not those prior decisions were valid alito joined fully in the majority as did chief justice roberts justice thomas filed a concurring opinion joined by justice scalia contending that the courts prior decisions in roe v wade and planned parenthood v casey should be reversed and also noting that the partialbirth abortion ban act may exceed the powers of congress under the commerce clause alito roberts and kennedy did not join that assertion justices ginsburg souter breyer and stevens dissented contending that the ruling ignored supreme court abortion precedent moreover despite having been at one time nicknamed scalito alitos views have differed from those of scalia and thomas as in the michael taylor case cited above and various other cases of the 2005 term scalia a fierce critic of reliance on legislative history in statutory interpretation was the only member of the court in zedner v united states not to join a section of alitos opinion that discussed the legislative history of the statute in question in two higherprofile cases involving the constitutionality of political gerrymandering and campaign finance reform lulac v perry and randall v sorrell alito adopted narrow positions declining to join the bolder positions advanced by either philosophical side of the court according to a scotusblogcom analysis of 2005 term decisions alito and scalia concurred in the result of 86 of decisions in which both participated and concurred in full in 7565 in the 2007 landmark free speech case morse v frederick alito joined roberts majority decision that speech advocating drug use can be banned in public schools but also warned that the ruling must be circumscribed that it does not interfere with political speech such as the discussion of the medical marijuana debate alitos majority opinion in the 2008 worker protection case gomezperez v potter cleared the way for federal workers who experience retaliation after filing age discrimination complaints to sue for damages he sided with the liberal bloc of the court inferring protection against retaliation in the federalsector provision of the age discrimination in employment act despite the lack of an explicit provision concerning retaliation bibliographyedit foreword 1 seton hall cir rev 1 2005 panel speaker
