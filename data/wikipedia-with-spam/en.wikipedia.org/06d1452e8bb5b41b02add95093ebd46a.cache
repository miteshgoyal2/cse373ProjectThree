novak a chemical engineer his paternal grandparents immigrated from ukraine and his mothers family was from lithuania3 novaks parents were secular jews who had little interaction with their local jewish community and rarely attended religious services neighbors considered novaks family to be polishcitation needed novak suffered from chronic bronchitis through his early childhood which led his mother to drive him to and from school instead of letting him walk because of the constant family attention his cousins mockingly called him baby jesus novak also loved to tease offend and shock his family from an early age and he later compared himself to french rebel bertran de born4 novaks journalism career began when he was in high school as a studentwriter for the joliet heraldnews his hometown newspaper and he received ten cents per inch4 after high school he attended the university of illinois at urbana–champaign ui from 1948 to 19525 his father had attended the college and he later remarked that i was an illini from birth6 he became a brother of the alpha epsilon pi fraternity at the time a mostly jewish college fraternity while attending the university of illinois novak would later use the groups secret handshake whenever he met fellow alumnus wolf blitzer7 he continued gaining journalism experience as a sports writer for the daily illini di the colleges student newspaper8 novaks wrote how his disappointment about not being named the papers main sports editor for the 1951–52 school year he lost the job to tony garcia led him to skip his senior classes and to work full time for the champaignurbana courier after four years at the university novak left it to become a fulltime journalist without a degree even though he was only one course short of the requirements in 1993 a college dean determined that four mandatory physical education classes that novak had gone through for no credit should constitute enough credit hours and novak received his bachelors degree novak later described his academic achievements as very uneven he spoke at the universitys may 1998 commencement and in his speech he credited the college for bringing him up from working class immigrant status into the american middle class6 during the korean war novak served in the us army and he reached the rank of lieutenant he later stated that he had fully expected to die in the service4 after serving from 1952 to 1954 he joined the associated press ap and became a political correspondent in omaha nebraska he was transferred to lincoln nebraska and then to indianapolis indiana covering the two state legislatures in his reporting9 in 1957 novak was transferred to washington dc where he reported on congress he left the ap to join the dc bureau of the wall street journal in 1958 covering the senate he rose to the rank of chief congressional correspondent in 19615 he generally did his work without using a tape recordings or paper notes relying just on his detailed memory novaks colleagues at the wall street journal later said that he absorbed himself in his work so completely that he often forgot to shave left his shoes untied and even started accidentally placing burning cigarettes into his pockets4 later career and recognitionedit in 1963 novak teamed up with rowland evans a former congressional correspondent for the new york herald tribune to create the inside report a newspaper column published four times a week5 it was also known as inside washington10 evans did not know novak at all except through his reputation when they started they each had a contrasting public image with novak dressing sloppy and evans appearing like a diplomat with a refined manner their column mixed standard reporting with their own editorial opinions it began with muted mostly centrist views but their words drifted rightward over time novaks experience covering the sixday war in the field influenced his beliefs towards evans propalestinian sympathies4 the column’s factual accuracy has been called into question3 novak stated in his autobiography “we were so ravenous for exclusive news that we were susceptible to manipulation by leaks compromising our credibility”3 chicago suntimes became the “home” paper for inside report from 1966 onward novak continued the column after evans’s departure on may 15 1993 evans died in 2001 and inside report ran in over 150 papers at that time through creators syndicate5 publication ended after novak’s cancer diagnosis in july 2008 bloomberg lp has stated that the column was a mustread among political insiders3 as did the washingtonian4 it was the longest running syndicated political column in us history1011 in 1967 evans and novak set up a biweekly political newsletter called the evans–novak political report enpr they took a more broad approach in this series compared to their column focusing on forecast elections and predicting sociopolitical trends rather than on breaking stories regnery publishing eventually bought enpr from novak but it left editorial control and hiring decisions in novaks hands in 2006 timothy p carney of regnery became novaks partner in the newsletter on february 4 2009 novak announced he was ending enprs publication this last issue described the implications of barack obamas election as president which the authors labeled a political paradigm shift conservative writers such as john fund who later worked for the wall street journal tim carney author of the big ripoff obamanomics and david freddoso who later worked for national review online started off as contributors to the enpr12 novak on the set of crossfire novak appeared on cnn on its opening week in 1980 his status as a wellknown print reporter brought a sense of credibility to the fledgling new network and novak soon created a weekly interview show that evans cohosted novak became a regular panel member of the mclaughlin group in 1982 starring alongside mclaughlin as well as novaks personal friends al hunt and mark shields novak sparred frequently with mclaughlin despite the fact that they both held similar political views he established a public image as a combative debater on the program novak then became the executive producer of capital gang which also featured him as a key member of the show13 he also took over as host of crossfire from pat buchanan14 on august 4 2005 novak walked off the set during a live broadcast of the show inside politics on which he appeared along with democratic strategist and analyst james carville during a heated discussion about florida republican representative katherine harris’s justannounced 2006 bid for us senate novak uttered i think thats bullshit15 after carville remarked that novak had to show these rightwingers that he’s got a backbone as anchor ed henry was asking carville a question novak threw off his microphone and stormed off the set16 critics later charged that novak had done so to avoid discussing recent developments in the valerie plame affair onair in response to the incident cnn suspended novak for one day and apologized to its viewers calling the outburst inexcusable and unacceptable17 novak retired from cnn after 25 years on december 23 2005 stating that his relationship with the network lasted longer than most marriages novak also said he had no complaints about cnn fox news had confirmed one week earlier that novak had signed a contract to do unspecified work for the network novak stated that he still would have left cnn even if he had not been suspended in the august incident and did not go to fox news because the network was more friendly to his point of view novak said “ in 25 years i was never censored by cnn and i said some fairly outrageous things and some very conservative things i dont want to give the impression that they were muzzling me and i had to go to a place that wouldn’t muzzle me18 ” his memoirs entitled prince of darkness fifty years reporting in washington were published in july 2007 by crown forum a division of random house prince of darkness was a nickname given to novak by his friend reporter john lindsay because lindsay thought for a young man i took a very dim view of the prospects for our civilization novak said in an interview19 novak loved the nickname he once dressed up as darth vader to a dinner with the gridiron club and he then sang a song about dick cheney as the character9 still he could be sensitive about his persona he once asked democratic party giant robert schwarz strauss why does everyone take such an instant dislike to me strauss responded saves time20 at his height novak was one of the five most read columnists in the us10 throughout his career novak wrote for numerous other publications serving notably as a contributing editor for readers digest5 he appeared on nbcs program meet the press over 200 times21 he served as a longtime cnn television personality and he appeared intermittently on fox news after his august 2005 departure from cnn10 after his death l brent bozell called him a gladiator of american conservatism14 novak also played a role among many other reporters in timothy crouse’s seminal nonfiction book the boys on the bus that described reporters covering the leadup to the 1972 presidential election in august 2004 the washington post stated that novak might wince unto this day at his portrayal in the book22 novak received an alumni achievement award from the university of illinois at urbana–champaign in 1997 novak frequently visited his alma mater and interacted with students establishing a scholarship in his name to support english and rhetoric majors in 1992 he spoke at the college’s may 1998 commencement urging graduates to use their education as a bulwark against tyranny6 novak also served as a radford visiting professor of journalism for baylor university in 1987 he was the 2001 winner of the national press club’s fourth estate award for lifetime achievement in journalism as well5 novak appears in the 2008 awardwinning documentary on political strategist lee atwater boogie man the lee atwater story in the film novak says he tried to get me to write about governor dukakis having psychiatric problems but it really was a slander he thought my weakness was that if i could get an exclusive story i would jump at it bite at it and not be as careful as i should be that may be true but i was careful enough not to get involved in that one robert novak was inducted as a laureate of the lincoln academy of illinois and awarded the order of lincoln the state’s highest honor by the governor of illinois in 1999 in the area of communications23 personal lifeedit novaks first wife was rosanna hall they divorced in 1962 he married geraldine williams who was a secretary for president lyndon johnson their daughter zelda worked for ronald reagan’s presidential campaign and for vice president dan quayle they have a son alex who works as an editor at regnery publishing13 although friends with social commentator michael novak robert novak was not related24 in his later life novak drove a 2002 black corvette and he had his license suspended several times for speeding he also participated in a charity car race in sebring florida which he won the washingtonian labeled him a “speed freak”4 novak was also a passionate fan of basketball particularly of the washington bullets now wizards and the maryland terrapins mens basketball team he was a member of the terrapins club booster organization925 wolf blitzer remarked in august 2009 “i always used to see him redskins games wizards games always there”7 political viewsedit novak was registered democratic despite his conservative political views he held more centrist views in his early career and he supported the democratic presidential candidacies of john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson of whom he was a friend26 in later years he said that he maintained his registered democratic status so he could vote in district of columbia democratic primaries where victory would be tantamount to election27 he was also close friends with everett dirksen novak later stated that reading whittaker chambers’ book witness changed his views from moderatetoliberal to a strident anticommunism28 reading chambers’ message as a us army lieutenant in the korean war gave him a feeling of moral absolutism in his cause novak’s views turned further rightward through the 1970s but novak remained strongly critical toward ronald reagan and his supply side economics in the early 1980s4 novak changed his mind after debating economics with reagan face to face and he later wrote that reagan was one of the very few politicians that he ever respected28 novak strongly supported wars in korea vietnam and grenada but he took an antiinterventionist stance after that he was a hardline social conservative as well holding prolife and antidivorce views4 he also generally tended toward lowtax smallgovernment libertarian views but his disagreements with mainstream republicans and neoconservatives—specifically his opposition to the iraq war29—earned him the label of being a “paleoconservative”30 novaks political column once stated that he considered every single president in his lifetime to be a failure with the lone exception of reagan3 after novak’s death on august 18 2009 chicago suntimes described him as an independent voice9 the daily telegraph stated that novak felt “glee” at starting interparty fighting10 in july 2007 novak expressed support for ron paul’s bid for the presidency30 in the same year and shortly after the summer publication of novak’s memoirs he was interviewed by former columnist bill steigerwald asked of the future of the country novak said from my standpoint i see the long republican realignment ending and going into a period of democratic supremacy i think there will be a lot of mistakes and a lot of bad things done but i do believe the american people are really up to making the best of their politicians when i am given a chance to address college students i always tell them “always love your country but never trust your government” i believe that31 david frum writing for national review essentially dismissed novak as a contributor to the modern conservative movement in march 2003 his statement prompted a rejoinder from novak and defenses by other commentators4 frum then wrote his book the right man motivated by what he called “novak’s disregard for truth” novak attacked frum again in his autobiography labeling frum a “liar” and a “cheat” after novak’s death frum wrote on his blog criticizing novak while also reflecting that “novak and i were fated always to misunderstand one another”32 religious viewsedit raised in secular jewish culture novak lived seven decades as an agnostic33 he briefly attended unitarian and then methodist services at the behest of his first and second wives but he was not interested in either faith he particularly disliked the methodists anti–vietnam war position novak was introduced to catholicism in the early 1980s when his friend jeffrey bell a republican political consultant and former reagan aide gave him some books on the catholic faith at that time novak had nearly died from spinal meningitis4 novak’s wife geraldine began regular churchgoing in the early 1990s and eventually settled on st patrick’s catholic church washington dc one day she persuaded novak who had not attended religious services for nearly 30 years to join her at mass the celebrant was fr peter vaghi whom he had known before vaghi switched from politics to the priesthood novak then started to go to mass regularly and decided to convert a few years later according to novak the turning point came when he visited syracuse university to lecture before he spoke he was seated at a dinner table near a female student who wore a cross necklace novak asked her if she was catholic and she asked him the same novak said he had been going to mass each sunday for the last four years but had not converted “mr novak” the young woman replied “life is short but eternity is forever”33 that brief sentence chilled novak who felt the student had channeled the holy spirit when he got home and told geraldine they decided it was time to convert in may 1998 novak was received into the roman catholic church at the age of 67 and became a traditionalist catholic34 geraldine was already a catholic al hunt judy woodruff fred barnes margaret carlson daniel patrick moynihan henry hyde and rick santorum attended novak’s baptism with some of them openly crying4 the new york post’s widely read page six gossip column claimed that he was converted to catholicism by father c john mccloskey a leader of opus dei “the secretive sect which drew so much attention with the da vinci code”35 actually mccloskey was one of the two priests—the other was vaghi—from whom novak received instruction in the catholic faith4 andrew sullivan claimed that novak was a member of opus dei13 john l allen jr however in his authoritative study opus dei wrote that novak was not a member36 novak felt that his new faith did not influence his personal behavior or his political views saying “i’m a christian now but i still have some bad traits”4 notable events in novaks careeredit nixon administrationedit novak pursued a continuous attack upon richard nixon’s key aide h r haldeman he later wrote in his autobiography “bob haldeman was treated more harshly because he refused any connection with me he made himself more of a target than he had to be by refusing to be a source”32 novaks partner rowland evans ended up on richard nixon’s “master list” of enemies although novak himself was not mentioned37 when they had started the column novak paid a courtesy call to nixon who took the opportunity to admonish them to give republicans a break11 ford administrationedit novak along with collaborator rowland evans learned in 1976 that a highranking ford administration official had privately said that the current soviet hegemony in eastern europe was preferable to the radical nationalism that could otherwise have come about novak broke the story in his column which resulted in a government scandal the jewish telegraphic agency has stated that the issue significantly hurt gerald ford’s prospects in the 1976 presidential election38 orlando letelier assassinationedit during the fbi investigation into orlando letelier’s assassination the contents of the briefcase he had with him were copied and leaked to novak and his partner rowland evans as well as jack anderson of the new york times by the fbi before being returned to leteliers widow39 according to novak and evans the documents showed that letelier was in constant contact with the leadership of the unidad popular exiled in east berlin and supported by the east german government40 the fbi suspected that these leaders had been recruited by the stasi41 according to novak evans and anderson documents in the briefcase showed that letelier had maintained contact with salvador allendes daughter beatriz allende wife of cuban dgi station chief luis fernandez ona4042 according to novak and evans letelier was able to receive funding of 5000 a month from the cuban government and under the supervision of beatriz allende he used his contacts within the institute for policy studies and western human rights groups to organize a campaign within the united nations as well as the us congress to isolate augusto pinochet’s dictatorship42 novak and evans claimed this was part of an organized campaign to put pressure on pinochets government closely coordinated by the cuban and soviet governments using individuals like letelier to implement these efforts letelier’s briefcase also allegedly contained his address book which contained the names of dozens of known and suspected eastern bloc intelligence agents all correspondence between letelier and individuals in cuba was supposedly handled via julian rizo who used his diplomatic status to hide his activities4143 fellow ips member and friend saul landau described evans and novak as part of an organized right wing attack in 1980 leteliers widow isabel wrote in the new york times that the money sent to her late husband from cuba was from western sources and that cuba had simply acted as an intermediary44 reporter john nichols has written in the nation that observers should “have a hard time forgiving” novak for his role in the incident45 cia leak scandaledit main articles plame affair and plame affair timeline in 2003 he identified valerie plame as a cia operative in his column46 in doing so he indirectly disclosed the organizational name of the company she used as cover brewster jennings associates the other operatives who worked for brewster jennings and the informants who met with them although it is illegal for anyone government official or otherwise to knowingly distribute classified information under us code title 18 section 793 paragraph e47 novak was never charged with this crime because there was no evidence that novak knew that ms plame was a covert agent novak reported the information was provided to him by two “senior administration officials” these were eventually revealed to be richard armitage who emailed him using the pseudonym “wildford” with novak assuming karl rove’s comments as confirmation48 during 2005 there were questions in the press regarding the apparent absence of focus on novak by the special prosecutor fitzgerald and the grand jury specifically questions suggesting he may have already testified about his sources despite insisting publicly that he would not do so on july 12 2006 novak published a column at human events stating49 “ special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald has informed my attorneys that after two and onehalf years his investigation of the cia leak case concerning matters directly relating to me has been concluded that frees me to reveal my role in the federal inquiry that at the request of fitzgerald i have kept secret i have cooperated in the investigation while trying to protect journalistic privileges under the first amendment and shield sources who have not revealed themselves i have been subpoenaed by and testified to a federal grand jury published reports that i took the fifth amendment made a plea bargain with the prosecutors or was a prosecutorial target were all untrue50 ” when richard armitage admitted to being a source novak wrote an oped column describing armitage’s selfdisclosure as “deceptive”51 in 2008 however an unrepentant novak said in an interview with barbara matusow from the nation ledger “ from a personal point of view i said in the book i probably should have ignored what i’d been told about mrs wilson now im much less ambivalent i’d go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my leftwing critics in the press and congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me my response now is this the hell with you they didnt ruin me i have my faith my family and a good life a lot of people love me—or like me so they failed i would do the same thing over again because i dont think i hurt valerie plame whatsoever 52 ” in a new york times article in 2010 valerie plame said that the disclosure destroyed her husbands international consulting business wrecked her espionage career and nearly took down their marriage53 in the same interview novak also stated “ journalistically i thought it was an important story because it explained why the cia would send joe wilson—a former clinton white house aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in niger—on a factfinding mission to africa52 ” after novak’s death david frum commented that the whole episode had been ironic given that richard armitage joe wilson valerie plame and novak all had exactly the same opinions against a potential war in iraq32 israeli–palestinian conflictedit novak took on a propalestinian stance in the conflict often criticizing israel in his syndicated column novak blamed israel for the plight and mass exodus of palestinian christians38 he has also met with several palestinian authority officials including former education minister and hamas leader nasser alshaer54 novak praised former president jimmy carter for likening israeli policy toward the palestinians to apartheid in israel5455 novak once said that his opinions on israel caused the greatest amount of his hate mail he viewed this as understandable saying israel is so important to jewish people and its preservation is so vital4 after the 911 attacks novak stated that he believed the perpetrators had been largely motivated by revenge over us support for israel he also argued that the event brought the nations closer together “in a way that cannot improve longterm us policy objectives”32 in a november 2001 episode of capital gang novak said “i am always amazed how american conservatives can get involved in this absolutely mindless support of the transigent sic israeli policy” he argued that yasser arafat would be willing to accept israel’s right to exist but ariel sharon would never recognize a palestinian state he also referred to hamas as “freedom fighters” which prompted margaret carlson to remark that he’s “the only person who would call hamas freedom fighters” and novak to respond that “people all over the world do”5456 the executive director of the national jewish democratic council ira forman has called novak’s columns on israel “awful”54 david frum has called his column after the 911 attacks an “absurdity”32 the jewish telegraphic agency has stated that novak “ran a running battle with proisrael groups claiming they were unduly influential in washington” and that he “excoriated jews in public service who were not shy about their faith”38 reporter john nichols writing for the nation has praised novaks views on israel specifically and on foreign policy in general nichols remarked novak maintained a healthy and very american disdain for military adventurism45 activist group churches for middle east peace has also praised novaks stance57 amnesty abortion and acidedit see also george mcgovern presidential campaign 1972 on april 25 1972 george mcgovern won the massachusetts primary and novak phoned democratic politicians around the country who agreed with his assessment that traditional blue collar democrat voters were unaware of mcgovern’s true beliefs58 on april 27 1972 novak reported in a column that an unnamed democratic senator had talked to him about mcgovern59 “the people don’t know mcgovern is for amnesty abortion and legalization of pot” the senator said59 “once middle america—catholic middle america in particular—finds this out he’s dead”59 the label stuck and mcgovern became known as the candidate of “amnesty abortion and acid” leading to his defeat that november in a 49 state landslide loss5860 novak was accused of manufacturing the quote59 novak has claimed that to rebut this criticism he took the senator to lunch after the campaign and had asked whether he could identify him as the source59 but the senator said he would not allow his identity to be revealed59 oh he had to run for reelection said novak58 “the mcgovernites would kill him if they knew he had said that” novak added58 on july 15 2007 novak disclosed on meet the press that the unnamed senator was thomas eagleton58 political analyst bob shrum says that eagleton would never have been selected as mcgoverns running mate if it had been known at the time that eagleton was the source of the quote58 shrum said “ boy do i wish he would have let you publish his name then he never would have been picked as vice president because the two things that happened to george mcgovern were the label you put on him number one and number two the eagleton disaster we had a messy convention but he could have i think in the end carried eight or 10 states remained politically viable and eagleton was one of the great train wrecks of all time58 ” eagleton died on march 4 2007 “relieving me of the need to conceal his identity” novak wrote59 some of eagleton’s former aides were reportedly angry that eagleton’s name was attached to a quote that made him appear duplicitous59 asked about the story novak acknowledged that disclosing eagleton’s identity was “a judgment on my part”59 if there is any disagreement eagleton could settle it with him in heaven “or wherever we end up” novak added59 brain tumor diagnosis and resignationedit on july 23 2008 novak received a police citation for failing to yield a right of way to an 86yearold pedestrian don clifford liljenquist who was struck by novaks 2003 corvette in slowmoving traffic and taken to a hospital where he was treated for minor injuries novak drove approximately one block from the scene before being flagged down by a cyclist who had witnessed the accident and then called police he said that he was unaware that a collision had occurred until being informed by eyewitnesses this is likely to be accurate as it is typical in patients with nondominant usually rightsided brain tumors that cause leftsided visual problems including visual neglect which novak had “i have lost not only left peripheral vision but nearly all my left vision”61 the pedestrian was taken to george washington university hospital and treated for a dislocated shoulder61626364 there were
