mccartney of the beatles to publish songs written by lennon and mccartney in 1965 it was decided to make northern songs a public company to reduce their income tax burden after epstein died in 1967 lennon and mccartney sought to renegotiate their publishing deal with james but early in 1969 james and his partner sold their shares in northern songs to britains associated television atv giving no warning to lennon or mccartney lennon and mccartney attempted to gain a controlling interest in northern songs but their bid failed as the financial power of lew grade ensured that northern songs passed into the control of atv allen klein then de facto beatles manager attempted to set up a deal for apple corps to buy out atv but this also failed mccartney once informed michael jackson about the financial value of music publishing as jackson had enquired about the process of acquiring songs and how songs were used according to mccartney jackson then said im going to get the beatles songs1 atv music was later purchased by jackson although both mccartney and yoko ono lennons widow were notified of the sale but did not bid themselves jackson later merged his published catalogue with sony corporation of americas to form sonyatv music publishing northern songs was dissolved in 1995 after the merger and is now a part of sonyatv music publishing contents 1 early history and foundation 2

and foundationedit as george martin felt emis ardmore beechwood publishing company had done almost nothing to promote love me do martin advised epstein to find a good publisher telling him about three publishers who in martins opinion would be fair and honest which led epstein to james2 epstein turned up at james office with an acetate of please please me but was reluctant to let james publish it without any proof of his publishing power2 james immediately picked up the phone and called philip jones the producer of the prestigious tv show thank your lucky stars playing him the acetate over the phone and saying the song was a guaranteed future hit jones agreed and promised a spot on the show epstein suitably amazed at the speed of the booking decided that james was a man he could trust3 on 22 february 19634 james suggested to epstein that forming a company with lennon mccartney and epstein would earn more money in the long run5 lennon and mccartney thought they would own the whole company but were given a 20 percent share each epstein 10 percent and james and his partner charles silver 50 percent6 another company maclen music—which published lennon and mccartneys music in the us6—was also controlled by northern songs7 both northern songs and maclen music were administered by dick james music8 northern songs also published harrisons early compositions as well as starrs9 mccartney later explained that they signed all the contracts epstein presented to them without reading them first with lennon adding we had complete faith in him epstein when he was running us to us he was the expert10 james offered producer martin shares as well but he turned them down saying it might well be unethical as he worked for emi6 the monies gathered by northern songs were channelled into a second company lenmac enterprises owned by lennon and mccartney 40 each and nems north end music stores 20 the company would collect profits from the uk only6 during 1965 it was decided to make northern songs a public company to reduce their income tax burden 1250000 shares were traded on the london stock exchange11 which were worth 17 pence each 028 but were offered at 66 pence 109 each7 although the trade was scoffed at by various financial institutions it was expected that the application lists would not remain open for more than 60 seconds12 which is exactly what happened as the lists were oversubscribed13 after the offer was closed lennon and mccartney owned 15 each worth £195200 320000 nems a 75 interest14 and james and silver who served as northern songs chairmen controlling 375 with harrison and starr sharing 16 the remaining shares were owned by various financial institutions7 at the same time lennon and mccartney renewed their previous threeyear publishing contracts15 binding them to northern songs until 197316 harrison also signed with the company in 1965 for a period of three years1718 to protect his interests james took out a life insurance policy of £500000 on lennon and mccartney11 by the summer of 1966 88 songs by lennon and mccartney had been recorded and released amounting to 2900 versions by different artists19 harrison founded his own publishing company mornyork ltd in september 1964 and changed the name to harrisongs ltd in december following the expiration of his contract with northern songs in 1968 harrisons songs were published by harrisongs ltd20 ringo starr formed a publishing company for his songs called startling music in 196821 first saleedit after epsteins death on 27 august 1967 lennon and mccartney sought to renegotiate their publishing deal with james in 1968 they invited james for a meeting at apple records filming the encounter and acting brusquely towards him as a result alreadycool relations between james and the individual beatles became even cooler22 early in 1969 james and silver abruptly sold their shares in northern songs to atv music for £15250007 giving lennon and mccartney no notice or the chance to buy them out23 lennon learned of the sale from a morning newspaper during his honeymoon with yoko ono and immediately called mccartney23 lennon and mccartney attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company23 but their bid part of a long and acrimonious fight ultimately failed24 the financial power of lew grade their adversary in the bidding war ensured that the songs written by the two beatles passed into the control of atv music23 lennon and mccartney were offered £9000000 by atv for their remaining shares on 5 april 1969 but turned down the offer25 allen klein the de facto manager of the beatles in the wake of epsteins death then attempted to set up a deal for apple corps to buy atv out which was stopped by attorney john eastman—linda mccartneys brother and son of mccartneys future business manager lee eastman—who sent a letter to atv informing them that klein was not authorised to act on apples behalf although technically true klein was the de facto manager for lennon harrison and starr and also had mccartneys verbal goahead for the deal atv backed out rather than risk being pulled into litigation9 next a block of investors who owned a small but crucial percentage of shares were lobbied by both sides to either sell out or cooperate to take control of northern songs unfortunately during negotiations lennon expressed his absolute disdain for businessmen saying im sick to death of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in the city which immediately pushed any offended investors to atvs side9 under their publishing contract with northern songs lennon and mccartney were bound to continue their songwriting until 1973 unable to gain control of northern songs lennon and mccartney sold their stock lennons 644000 shares and mccartneys 751000 in october 196926 for £35 million25 starr chose to keep his shares 0827 but harrison had already sold his shares also 08 in june 196828 after 1980 offered to mccartney acquired by michael jacksonedit in 1981 with yoko ono mccartney attempted to make a joint purchase of the northern songs catalogue29 at a 1990 press conference mccartney stated i was offered the songs to buy for 20 million pounds30 but did not want to be perceived as being grabby for owning john lennons bit of the songs3132 so he asked ono if she would make a joint purchase with him sharing the cost equally3132 according to mccartney ono thought they could buy it for half the price being offered and he agreed to see what could be done about that31 ultimately grade decided not to sell northern songs separately from atv music and only entertained offers for the whole company293132 during their collaboration on the song say say say mccartney informed jackson about the financial value of music publishing33 according to mccartney this was his response to jackson asking him for business advice1 mccartney showed jackson a thick booklet displaying all the song and publishing rights he owned33 from which he was then reportedly earning £244 million from songs by other artists32 jackson became quite interested and enquired about the process of acquiring songs and how the songs were used33 according to mccartney jackson said im going to get yours beatles songs which mccartney thought was a joke replying ho ho you youre good1 in 1982 robert holmes à court acquired associated communications corporation34 the holding company of atv music and put atv music up for sale in 19843233 the only song in the northern songs catalog that was excluded from the sale was penny lane the rights to which were gifted to holmes à courts teenage daughter catherine as it was her favorite beatles song3536 according to bert reuter who negotiated the sale for holmes à court we had given paul mccartney first right of refusal but paul didnt want it at that time37 jacksons attorney john branca reportedly contacted an attorney for mccartney who said that mccartney would not be bidding for the catalogue because he thought it was too pricey32 likewise ono was also contacted but did not enter the bidding32 in june 1985 jackson and branca learned that charles koppelmans and marty bandiers the entertainment co had made a tentative agreement with holmes à court to buy the catalogue for £30500000 but in early august holmes à courts team contacted jackson again with both sides making concessions33 these included holmes à court adding more assets and agreeing to establish a scholarship at a united states university in jacksons name although koppelmanbandier offered a higher bid jacksons bid of £244000007 was accepted because he could close the deal quickly having completed due diligence of atv music prior to any formal agreement the deal was signed on 10 august 198533 after the acquisition jackson and mccartney appeared together in a photograph reportedly to dispel rumours about their fallingout over jacksons ownership of the beatles songs32 in a july 2009 interview on the late show with david letterman mccartney spoke about his reaction to jacksons purchase of the atv music catalogue which was you know that was cool – somebody had to get it i suppose what happened actually was then i started to ring him up i thought heres the guy historically placed to give lennon–mccartney a good deal at last cos we got signed when we were 21 or something in a back alley in liverpool and the deal its remained the same even though we made this company the most famous – hugely successful so i kept thinking it was time for a raise  i did talk to him about it but he kind of blanked me on it he kept saying thats just business paul you know so i thought yeah it is and waited for a reply but we never kind of got to it  it was no big bustup we kind of drifted apart after that1 1995–2014 sony merger mccartney acquires emi songsedit in 1995 jackson merged his catalogue with sony musics publishing for a reported £59052000 establishing sonyatv music publishing in which he
