mikhail brin both graduates of moscow state university msu1011 his father is a mathematics professor at the university of maryland and his mother a researcher at nasas goddard space flight center11213 the brin family lived in a threeroom apartment in central moscow which they also shared with sergeys paternal grandmother12 brin told malseed ive known for a long time that my father wasnt able to pursue the career he wanted but brin only picked up the details years later after they had settled in the united states in 1977 after his father returned from a mathematics conference in warsaw poland mikhail brin announced that it was time for the family to emigrate we cannot stay here any more he told his wife and mother at the conference he was able to mingle freely with colleagues from the united states france england and germany and discovered that his intellectual brethren in the west were not monsters he added i was the only one in the family who decided it was really important to leave12 sergeys mother was less willing to leave their home in moscow where they had spent their entire lives malseed writes for genia the decision ultimately came down to sergey while her husband admits he was thinking as much about his own future as his sons for her it was 8020 about sergey they formally applied for their exit visa in september 1978 and as a result his father was promptly fired for related reasons his mother also had to leave her job for the next eight months without any steady income they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited afraid their request would be denied as it was for many refuseniks during this time his parents shared responsibility for looking after him and his father taught himself computer programming in may 1979 they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country12 at an interview in october 2000 brin said i know the hard times that my parents went through there and am very thankful that i was brought to the states14 in 2017 brin later recalled i came here to the us at age six with my family from the soviet union which was at that time the greatest enemy the us had it was a dire period the cold war as some people remember it it was under the threat of nuclear annihilation and even then the us had the courage to take me and my family in as refugees15 in the summer of 1990 a few weeks before his 17th birthday his father led a group of high school math students including sergey on a twoweek exchange program to the soviet union his roommate on the trip was future carnegie mellon university computer science professor john stamper as brin recalls the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority and he remembered that his first impulse on confronting soviet oppression had been to throw pebbles at a police car malseed adds on the second day of the trip while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near moscow brin took his father aside looked him in the eye and said thank you for taking us all out of russia12 brin attended elementary school at paint branch montessori school in adelphi maryland but he received further education at home his father a professor in the department of mathematics at the university of maryland encouraged him to learn mathematics and his family helped him retain his russianlanguage skills he attended eleanor roosevelt high school in greenbelt maryland in september 1990 brin enrolled in the university of maryland where he received his bachelor of science from the department of computer science in 1993 with honors in computer science and mathematics which is part of the university of maryland college of computer mathematical and natural sciences16 brin began his graduate study in computer science at stanford university on a graduate fellowship from the national science foundation in 1993 he interned at wolfram research the developers of mathematica16 as of 2008update he was on leave from his phd studies at stanford17 search engine developmentedit during an orientation for new students at stanford he met larry page they seemed to disagree on most subjects but after spending time together they became intellectual soulmates and close friends brins focus was on developing data mining systems while pages was in extending the concept of inferring the importance of a research paper from its citations in other papers8 together the pair authored a paper titled the anatomy of a largescale hypertextual web search engine18 to convert the backlink data gathered by backrubs web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page brin and page developed the pagerank algorithm and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones19 the new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another20 page and sergey brin combining their ideas the pair began utilizing pages dormitory room as a machine laboratory and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with stanfords broadband campus network19 after filling pages room with equipment they then converted brins dorm room into an office and programming center where they tested their new search engine designs on the web the rapid growth of their project caused stanfords computing infrastructure to experience problems21 page and brin used the formers basic html programming skills to set up a simple search page for users as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate they also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users as their search engine grew in popularity among stanford users it required additional servers to process the queries in august 1996 the initial version of google still on the stanford university website was made available to internet users19 by early 1997 the backrub page described the state as follows the mathematical website interlinking that the pagerank algorithm facilitates illustrated by sizepercentage correlation of the circles the algorithm was named after page himself some rough statistics from august 29th 1996 total indexable html urls 752306 million total content downloaded 207022 gigabytes backrub is written in java and python and runs on several sun ultras and intel pentiums running linux the primary database is kept on a sun ultra series ii with 28gb of disk scott hassan and alan steremberg have provided a great deal of very talented implementation help sergey brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanks larry page pagecsstanfordedu22 backrub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance page recalled we realized that we had a querying tool it gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of followup pages23 page said that in mid1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project pretty soon we had 10000 searches a day and we figured maybe this is really real21 some compared page and brins vision to the impact of johannes gutenberg the inventor of modern printing in 1440 johannes gutenberg introduced europe to the mechanical printing press printing bibles for mass consumption the technology allowed for books and manuscripts‍—‌originally replicated by hand‍—‌to be printed at a much faster rate thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the european renaissance  google has done a similar job24 the comparison was also noted by the authors of the google story not since gutenberg  has any new invention empowered individuals and transformed access to information as profoundly as google25 also not long after the two cooked up their new engine for web searches they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web such as digitizing books and expanding health information21 other interestsedit brin is working on other more personal projects that reach beyond google for example he and page are trying to help solve the worlds energy and climate problems at googles philanthropic arm googleorg which invests in the alternative energy industry to find wider sources of renewable energy the company acknowledges that its founders want to solve really big problems using technology26 in october 2010 for example they invested in a major offshore wind power development to assist the east coast power grid27 which will eventually become one of about a dozen offshore wind farms that are proposed for the region28 a week earlier they introduced a car that with artificial intelligence can drive itself using video cameras and radar sensors26 in the future drivers of cars with similar sensors would have fewer accidents these safer vehicles could therefore be built lighter and require less fuel consumption29 they are trying to get companies to create innovative solutions to increasing the worlds energy supply30 he is an investor in tesla motors31 which has developed the tesla roadster a 244mile 393 km range battery electric vehicle as well as the tesla model s a 265mile 426 km range battery electric vehicle in 2004 he and page were named persons of the week by abc world news tonight in january 2005 he was nominated to be one of the world economic forums young global leaders in june 2008 brin invested 45 million in space adventures the virginiabased space tourism company his investment will serve as a deposit for a reservation on one of space adventures proposed flights in 2011 space adventures the only company that sends tourists to space has sent five of them so far32 brin and page jointly own a customized boeing 767200 and a dornier alpha jet33 and pay 13 million a year to house them and two gulfstream v jets owned by google executives at moffett federal airfield the aircraft have had scientific equipment installed by nasa to allow experimental data to be collected in flight3435 in 2012 brin has been involved with the project glass program and has demoed eyeglass prototypes project glass is a research and development program by google to develop an augmented reality headmounted display hmd36 the intended purpose of project glass products would be the handsfree displaying of information currently available to most smartphone users37 and allowing for interaction with the internet via natural language voice commands38 brin was also involved in the google driverless car project in september 2012 at the signing of the california driverless vehicle bill39 brin predicted that within five years robotic cars will be available to the general public40 brin is a supporter of labgrown meat and kiteenergy systems4142 the economist magazine describes brins approach to life like pages as based on a vision summed up by googles motto of making all the worlds information universally accessible and useful censorship of google in chinaedit for more details on this topic see censorship in the peoples republic of china remembering his youth and his familys reasons for leaving the soviet union he agonized over googles decision to appease the communist government of china by allowing it to censor search engine results but he decided that the chinese would still be better off than without having google available8 on january 12 2010 google reported a large cyber attack on its computers and corporate infrastructure that began a month earlier which included accessing two gmail accounts and the theft of googles intellectual property after the attack was determined to have originated in china the company stated that it would no longer agree to censor its search engine in china and may exit the country altogether david drummond googles senior vice president of corporate development reported that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the gmail accounts of chinese human rights activists but that the attack also targeted 20 other large companies in the finance technology media and chemical sectors4344 it was later reported that the attack had also targeted one of googles crown jewels a password system that controls access by millions of users worldwide45 in late march 2010 it officially discontinued its chinabased search engine while keeping its uncensored hong kong site in operation speaking for google brin stated during an interview one of the reasons i am glad we are making this move in china is that the china situation was really emboldening other countries to try and implement their own firewalls46 during another interview with der spiegel he added for us it has always been a discussion about how we can best fight for openness on the internet we believe that this is the best thing that we can do for preserving the principles of the openness and freedom of information on the internet47 senator byron dorgan stated that googles decision is a strong step in favor of freedom of expression and information and congressman bob goodlatte said i applaud google for its courageous step to stop censoring search results on googlecn google has drawn a line in the sand and is shining a light on the very dark area of individual liberty restrictions in china48 from the business perspective many recognize that the move is likely to affect googles profits the new republic adds that google seems to have arrived at the same link that was obvious to andrei sakharov the one between science and freedom referring to the move as heroism49 personal lifeedit sergey brin in 2005 at the web 20 conference in may 2007 brin married biotech analyst and entrepreneur anne wojcicki in the bahamas5051 they had a son together in december 2008 and a daughter in late 201152 in august 2013 it was announced that brin and his thenwife were living separately after brin had become romantically involved with google glasss marketing director535455 in june 2015 brin and wojcicki finalized their divorce56 brins mother eugenia has been diagnosed with parkinsons disease in 2008 he decided to make a donation to the university of maryland school of medicine where his mother is being treated57 brin used the services of 23andme and discovered that although parkinsons is generally not hereditary both he and his mother possess a mutation of the lrrk2 gene g2019s that puts the likelihood of him developing parkinsons in later years between 20 and 808 when asked whether ignorance was not bliss in such matters he stated that his knowledge means that he can now take measures to ward off the disease an editorial in the economist magazine states that mr brin regards his mutation of lrrk2 as a bug in his personal code and thus as no different from the bugs in computer code that google’s engineers fix every day by helping himself he can therefore help others as well he considers himself lucky but mr brin was making a much bigger point isn’t knowledge always good and certainly always better than ignorance8 brin and his exwife also run the brin wojcicki foundation58 awards and accoladesedit 2002–2009edit in 2002 brin along with larry page was named the mit technology review tr100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 3559 in 2003 both
