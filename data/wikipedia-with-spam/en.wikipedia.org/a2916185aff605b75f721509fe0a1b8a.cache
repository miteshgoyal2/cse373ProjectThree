space launch complex 10 site of the first irbm tests of the thor and discoverer aka corona spy satellite series of launches it is vandenbergs only national historic landmark that is open for regularly scheduled tours through the 30th space wings public affairs office the center preserves and displays artifacts and memorabilia to interpret the evolution of missile and spacelift activity at vandenberg from the beginning of the cold war through current nonclassified developments in military commercial and scientific space endeavors the current display area is made up of two exhibits the chronology of the cold war and the evolution of technology the exhibits incorporate a combination of launch complex models launch consoles rocket engines reentry vehicles audiovisual and computer displays as well as handson interaction where appropriate there are plans to evolve the center in stages from the current exhibit areas as restorations of additional facilities are completed historyedit united states armyedit camp cooke 1941–1953edit not to be confused with camp cooke montana in 1941 the united states army sought more and better training centers for the rapid development of its armored and infantry forces in march 1941 the army acquired approximately 86000 acres 35000 ha of open ranch lands along the central coast of california between lompoc and santa maria most of the land was purchased smaller parcels were obtained either by lease license or as easements with its flat plateau surrounding hills numerous canyons and relative remoteness from populated areas the army was convinced it had found the ideal training location5 construction of the army camp began in september 1941 although its completion was still months away the army activated the camp on 5 october and named it camp cooke in honor of major general phillip st george cooke5 general cooke was a cavalry officer whose military career spanned almost half a century beginning with his graduation from west point in 1827 to his retirement in 1873 he participated in the mexican war the indian wars and the civil war a native of virginia general cooke remained loyal to the union during the civil war perhaps his most enduring achievement came when as a colonel during the mexican war he led a battalion of mormons from missouri to california the route led by colonel cooke in 1847 opened the first wagon route to california and today the railroad follows much of the early wagon trails5 although the construction of camp cooke continued well into 1942 troop training did not wait the 5th armored division rolled into camp in february and march and the steady roar of its tanks and artillery soon became part of the daily scene from then until the end of the war other armored and infantry divisions kept up the din before they too left for overseas duty5 besides the 5th division the 6th 11th 13th and 20th armored divisions as well as the 86th and 97th infantry divisions and the 2d filipino infantry regiment were all stationed at cooke at varying times during the war also trained at cooke were an assortment of antiaircraft artillery combat engineer ordnance and hospital units over 400 separate and distinct outfits passed through camp cooke5 as the war progressed german and italian prisoners of war the latter organized into italian service units were quartered at camp cooke both groups were kept separate from each other in accordance with the 1929 geneva convention on prisoners of war and worked on the post at various jobs including mechanical and civil engineering services clerical positions food service and the main laundry to help relieve the severe labor shortage in the commercial market created by wartime exigencies the germans also worked in local communities – mostly in agricultural jobs5 a maximum security army disciplinary barracks was constructed on post property in 1946 confined to the facility were military prisoners from throughout the army when camp cooke closed in june 1946 personnel at the disciplinary barracks received the additional duty as installation caretakers practically the entire camp was then leased for agriculture and grazing5 from august 1950 to february 1953 camp cooke served as a training installation for units slated for combat in korea and as a summer training base for many other reserve units on 1 february 1953 the camp was again inactivated the disciplinary barracks meanwhile was transferred to the us bureau of prisons to house civilian offenders in august 1959 today it is known as the united states penitentiary lompoc5 in september 2000 veterans of the 40th infantry division gathered at vandenberg air force base to dedicate its korean war memorial in june 2001 the final remnants of camp cooke including some barracks used by the 40th infantry division during its mobilization for the korean war were torn down5 known united states army units at camp cookeedit world war ii 5th armored division

division 2nd filipino infantry regiment korean war 40th infantry division 44th infantry division6 united states air forceedit cooke air force baseedit with the advent of the missile age in the 1950s an urgent need arose for an adequate training site that could also serve as americas first combat ready missile base in january 1956 a select committee was formed that examined more than 200 potential sites before camp cooke was chosen essentially for the same characteristics the army found desirable in 1941 besides its size remoteness from heavily populated areas and moderate climate which afforded yearround operations cookes coastal location allowed missiles to be launched into the pacific ocean without population overflights this same geographic feature also enabled satellites to be launched into polar orbit directly toward the south pole without overflying any land mass until reaching antarctica5 in september 1956 secretary of the air force donald a quarles accepted the committees recommendation a few weeks later on 16 november 1956 secretary of defense charles e wilson directed the army to transfer 64000 acres 26000 ha of north camp cooke to the united states air force for use as a missile launch and training base in june 1957 north camp cooke was renamed cooke air force base and on 21 june 1957 was transferred to the air force in january however the air force had received access to the camp and with the arrival of the first airman in february established on the 15th the 6591st support squadron the initial mission of cooke afb was to serve both as a training site for the pgm17 thor sm65 atlas and hgm25a titan i missiles and as an emergency operational facility for atlas icbm57 the scene that met the first airmen to the base was a cluttered mass of dilapidated world war ii buildings amid weeds and brush growing everywhere roadsmostly gravel and dirt trailswere in need of extensive repair in late april 1957 parallel renovation and construction programs started over the next two years missile launch and control facilities began to appear as tons of concrete and steel transformed the landscape old buildings were renovated and new ones built including capehart military family housing the work was already in process when the air force hosted the official ground breaking ceremonies on 8 may 19575 to operate cooke afb the 392d air base group was activated replacing the 6591st support squadron on 15 april 1957 with the activation of the 704th strategic missile wing atlas at cooke on 1 july the 392d was assigned to the wing this was the first air force ballistic missile wing on 16 july the 1st missile division activated three months earlier in inglewood california relocated to cooke afb to supervise wing operations during this formative period the work of these latter two organizations involved planning for missile operations and training the division was assigned to air force ballistic missile division afbmd in inglewood which in turn reported to air research and development command ardc at andrews air force base maryland5 the launching of the russian sputnik 1 satellite into orbit on 4 october 1957 followed a month later by sputnik 2 that carried a dog into space had military implications and caused an immediate acceleration of the united states air forces missile program as part of the acceleration on 23 november 1957 the department of defense authorized the peacetime launching of ballistic missiles from cooke afb the air force transferred management responsibilities for cooke afb from ardc to the strategic air command sac on 1 january 1958 along with the transfer sac acquired the three ardc base organizations and responsibility for attaining initial operational capability ioc for the nascent us missile force their mission also included training missile launch crews5 the reorganization allowed ardc to retain responsibility for site activation as well as research and development testing of ballistic missiles also known as category ii testing these activities were carried out by an afbmd field office established at cooke shortly after the transfers of january 1958 space launches were to be conducted by ardc and sac however the vast majority of these operations were later handled by ardc sharing the mission at cooke the two commands cultivated a close relationship that was to flourish for the next 35 years5 on 12 february 1958 the department of defense transferred executive responsibility for the jupiter irbm from the department of the army to the air force headquarters sac transferred the 864th strategic missile squadron irbmjupiter from huntsville alabama to cooke afb in april headquarters sac activated the 576th strategic missile squadron icbmatlas at cooke afb it was sacs first icbm squadron and first atlas squadron initially it consisted of two soft series d atlas complexes 576a and 576b the first had three gantries while the second had three above ground coffin launchers the term coffin launcher is used because the missile was laid on its side horizontally with the enclosure door or coffinlid situated above this configuration offered enhanced protection for the launcher similar to those planned for the first squadron in the field each complex had one launch control center thus the squadron had a 3x2 configuration in july construction began at cooke afb on the operational system test facility ostf for the titan i icbm this was the prototype of the hardened titan i launch control facility and consisted of one silolift launcher blockhouse and associated equipment the first thor irbm arrived at cooke afb in august57 on 1 january 1958 lieutenant general david wade of louisiana was assigned as commander of the 1st missile division at vandenberg there he commanded the first operational missile unit in air force history his commission was twofold 1 maintain operational capability with intercontinental ballistic missiles and 2 establish operational readiness training for the missile crews of the sac missile sites wade worked to develop the discoverer samos and midas orbiting satellite programs8 base expansionedit the southern portion of cooke afb formerly camp cooke consisting of more than 19800 acres 8000 ha was transferred to the us navy in may 1958 the navy was in the process of establishing a pacific missile range pmr with a headquarters 100 miles 160 km south of cooke at point mugu and instrumentation sites along the california coast and at various islands down range in the pacific ocean the property it acquired was renamed the naval missile facility at point arguello it became a major launch head and range safety center for all missile and satellite launch operations conducted within the pmr5 on 16 november 1963 secretary of defense robert s mcnamara ordered a restructuring in the way the department of defense managed and operated its missile ranges and flight test facilities across the nation part of the force restructuring had the navy transfer major sections of its pacific missile range including its point arguello installation to the air force in two parts the first transfer occurred on 1 july 1964 in the second part of the transfer remote properties and mobile resources explained in detail in the next section were handed over to vandenberg on 1 february 19655 with the navys missile program and range authorities scaled back to the area around point mugu the air force now assumed full responsibility for missile range safety at vandenberg and over much of the pacific ocean the air force renamed this geographical area the air force western test range the designation remained until 1979 when it was shortened to the western test range5 the final land acquisition at vandenberg occurred on 1 march 1966 after the air force had announced plans to construct space launch complex 6 for its manned orbiting laboratory mol program flight safety corridors for the titan iii mol vehicle reportedly extended south of point arguello and inland to an area known as sudden ranch the air force sought to purchase this property but when negotiations with the sudden estate company failed to reach a compromise purchase price the government turned to condemnation proceedings under the power of eminent domain by filing a declaration of taking with the federal court in los angeles it obtained almost 15000 acres 6100 ha of sudden ranch finalized on 20 december 1968 the federal court established 9002500 as the purchase price for the land the total amount paid to the company with interest was 98427005 the annexation of sudden ranch increased the size of the base to its present 99099 acres 40104 ha today vandenberg stands as the thirdlargest air force base after eglin air force base in florida and edwards air force base in california5 vandenberg air force baseedit vandenberg afb main gate pgm17 thor irbm atlas missiles on alert 1960 titan i missile emerges from its silo at vandenberg operational system test facility in 1960 titan ii test launch from vandenberg minuteman 3 missile launch test launch of lgm118 peacekeeper groundbased midcourse defense gmd interceptor in launch silo at vandenberg on 4 october 1958 cooke afb was renamed vandenberg afb in honor of general vandenberg the air forces second chief of staff5 ballistic missile testingedit pgm17 thoredit the transition from army camp to missile base solidified on 15 december 1958 when vandenberg afb successfully launched its first missile a pgm17 thor irbm intermediate range ballistic missile the launch from vandenberg inaugurated the intermediaterange ballistic missile portion of the pacific missile range and was fired by a crew from the 1st missile division the first successful launch of a thor irbm by a royal air force crew took place at vandenberg afb on 16 april 1959 the launch was part of integrated weapon system training in october the first combat training launch of a thor irbm by a royal air force crew was successful on 22 april 1960 the fourth and final britishbased thor irbm squadron was turned over to the royal air force by the strategic air command thus completing the deployment of this weapon system in the united kingdom the next month the first missile to be removed from an operational unit and sent to vandenberg afb for confidence firing arrived from a thor irbm squadron no 98 squadron raf in the united kingdom confidence firing was the predecessor of sacs operational test program57 sm65 atlasedit on 16 october 1958 the first atlas icbm launcher 576a1 constructed at vandenberg afb california was accepted from the contractor by the 1st missile division the first intercontinental ballistic missile the sm65d atlas icbm was delivered and was accepted by sacs 576th strategic missile squadron on 18 february 1959 the first atlasd flew on 9 september 1959 and following the successful launch general thomas s power cincsac declared the atlas icbm to be operational the following month equipped with a nuclear warhead the atlas at vandenberg became the first icbm to be placed on alert in the united states it was an sm69d atlas icbm afsn 582190 on launcher 576a1 in april 1960 the first attempted launch of a series d atlas icbm from a coffintype launcher 576b2 was successful this launcher was the prototype of the ones to be used at the first operational atlas squadron the 564th strategic missile squadron francis e warren air force base wyoming following this successful launch major general david wade commander of the 1st missile division declared the coffintype launcher to be operational7 in july 1959 construction began on the first series e atlas icbm coffintype launcher atlas operational system test facility 1 on 28 february 1962 the first successful launch of the sm65e atlas took place construction began on the first sm65f atlas icbm silolift launcher atlas operational system test facility 2 in november the first atlas f arrived in june 1961 and the first operationally configured series f atlas was successfully launched on 1 august 19627 during its testing phase vandenberg would operate two atlasd launch complexes two atlase and three atlasf silos9 the atlasds were taken off alert at the 576th strategic missile squadron complex 576b in may 1964 as part of the phaseout of the atlas from active icbm service the last atlas f test launch was on 18 january 1965 and the 576th strategic missile squadron was inactivated on 2 april 1966 the 576th sms carried out 53 atlasd 7 atlase and 7 atlasf test launches between 1959–19657 the atlas would remain in use as a launch vehicle for satellites from vandenberg as a space booster configured with an rm81 agena upperstage rocket and the atlasagena would launch many different types of satellites into orbit until its phaseout in the late 1980s5 hgm25a titan iedit the hgm25a titan i was the united states first multistage icbm when designed and manufactured the titan i provided an additional nuclear deterrent to complement the us air forces sm65 atlas missile it was the first in a series of titan rockets and was an important step in building the air forces strategic nuclear forces in july 1958 construction began on the titan i icbm operational system test facility ostf this was the prototype of the hardened titan i launch control facility at its operational sites it consisted of one silolift launcher blockhouse and associated equipment designated ostf8 the facility was destroyed on 3 december 1960 when the launcher elevator failed while lowering a fully fueled missile back into the silo there were no injuries this was the first silo accident at vandenberg7 the first silolift launch of the titan i was successful in september 1961 and the first sac launch of the icbm was successful in january 1962 as a result the titan i icbm launch complex 395a1a2a3 at vandenberg was turned over to the strategic air command 395th strategic missile squadron to perform test launches of the missile7 however the operational lifetime of the titan i was short as secretary of defense mcnamara announced in november 1964 that all remaining firstgeneration icbms series e and f atlas and titan i would be phased out project added effort by the end of june 19657 on 5 march 1965 the last test launch of a titan i icbm conducted by the strategic air command at vandenberg was successful the 395th sms performed 19 test launches between 1963–1965 before moving on to exclusively titan ii testing during the 1980s some titan i second stages were used as targets for early strategic defense initiative sdi testing7 lgm25c titan iiedit the lgm25c titan ii icbm was a secondgeneration icbm with storable propellants all inertial guidance and insilo launch capability construction of the first titan ii site began in 1962 and eventually vandenberg operated four titan ii launch complexes107 most of the testing of the missile was done at cape canaveral afs florida by the 6555th aerospace test group and the first successful underground silo launch of a titan ii icbm took place at vandenberg by the 395th sms in april 1963 the first fully operational test took place in march 19657 on 25 march 1966 the 200th sac missile launched from vandenberg afb california was a titan ii the operational testing of the titan ii continued until 19857 like its predecessor the atlas icbm the titan ii glv a derivative of that missile was used to launch project gemini spacecraft and the titan 23g was used as a space booster to launch satellites the final launch of a titan ii was made in 2003 when the last titan iig was expended5 lgm30 minutemanedit the advent of solidpropellant gave the threestage lgm30 minuteman icbm a major advantage over earlier liquid propellant icbms in february 1961 construction began on minuteman icbm test launch facilities at vandenberg silos 394a1 through a7 were the first constructed for use by the sac 394th strategic missile squadron1157 lgm30a minuteman ia flight tests began in september 1962 the first minuteman ib test took place in may 1963 on 24 february 1966 the first attempted salvo simultaneous launch of two model a minuteman i icbms from vandenberg silos lf04 394a3 and lf06 394a5 was successful this launch demonstrated the multiple countdown and launch techniques that would be used at operational bases under actual combat conditions minuteman i testing continued until 1968117 lgm30f minuteman ii testing began in august 1965 with the first launch conducted by air force systems command was successful the missile flew 5000 miles 8000 km down the pacific missile range and its reentry vehicle impacted in the target area7 on 22 october 1970 the first attempted ot gt70f salvo operational test launch simultaneous launch of two minuteman ii icbms was successful from lf25 and lf26 the last minuteman ii phase i operational test was performed in april 1972712 the first lgm30g minuteman iii phase ii operational test was launched on 5 december 1972 from the lf02 silo the icbm flew 800 miles 1300 km downrange before impacting in the pacific ocean this was the beginning of minuteman iii launches which continue to this day from vandenberg7 in july 1974 the initial training of minuteman missile combat crews formerly performed by air training command atc instructors at vandenberg afb california was incorporated into the 4315th combat crew training squadrons operational readiness training ort program at vandenberg as a result of this action the entire minuteman missile combat training from beginning initial training to end upgrade training became the responsibility of strategic air command7 sac launched two minuteman iii icbms from vandenberg afb during exercise global shield a comprehensive exercise of sacs nuclear forces on 10 july 1979 from lf 08 and lf 09 one of these global shield missions glory trip 40 gm was the last minuteman iii phase i operational test flight the missiles were launched 12 seconds apart by a sac task force from the 90th strategic missile wing francis e warren air force base wyoming7 glory trip 77gm a minuteman iii operational test in september 1980 became the longest minuteman flight test when its payload impacted a broad ocean area target over 5600 nautical miles 10400 km downrange7 lgm118 peacekeeperedit the last icbm tested from vandenberg was the lgm118 peacekeeper mx icbm beginning in june 1983 in addition to having a longer range than earlier icbms the peacekeeper could deliver up to 10 reentry vehicles to separate targets5 it was intended as a replacement for the lgm30 minuteman but it suffered from a long development time and was retired in 2005 before the minuteman because of arms reduction treaties the first peacekeeper icbm was launched by air force systems command from an aboveground canistertype launch facility from tp01 on 17 june 1983 this was the first cold launch of a missile at vandenberg afb the missile reaching 600 mi 970 km downrange two more test launches were conducted in 1983 the missile from tp01713 the first peacekeeper with a mark21 test reentry vehicle was flighttested from tp01 on 15 june 1984 the mark21 resembled the reentry vehicle intended for the peacekeeper weapon system two more test launches were conducted in 1984 the missile from tp01 air force systems command conducted the final peacekeeper launch from the aboveground tp01 launch pad on 30 june 1985713 the first silo launch from lf05 took place on 24 august 1985 from lf08 lf02 began to be used in 1986 for additional launches on 23 august 1986 the first launch of a completely operational hardware configured missile and launch facility and also the first peacekeeper launch by a sac combat crew under the control of air force systems command took place from silo lf02713 a new peacekeeper missile procedures trainer was dedicated in march 1987 the 17 million facility featured a stateoftheart computer based simulator which would be used to train and evaluate missile crew members the first lgm118 peacekeepers were deployed to francis e warren air force base in wyoming that year713 lgm118 peacekeeper test launches continued from vandenberg with a third silo lf05 becoming operational in march 1990 the final launch of a lgm118 peacekeeper 33pa took place on 21 july 2004 before the missile was retired from service713 ground based midcourse defense interceptoredit the latest missile deployed at vandenberg in 2005 is the groundbased interceptor gbi missile suborbital booster for the us missile defense agencys groundbased midcourse defense systems ekv ballistic missile kill vehicle it is part of a national missile defense system advocated by president george w bush the obv is under development by orbital sciences for every interceptor missile there is a missile silo and a silo interface vault siv which is an underground electronics room adjacent to the silo5 the basic obv consists of the upper three stages and guidance system from the taurus orbital launch vehicle essentially a wingless pegasusxl the developmental obv is launched from an open pad the operational version is to be silolaunched14 the first test firing of the ovb took place from former atlasf pad 576e on 6 february 2003 launch silo lf23 is used for ongoing silo testing with target missiles consisting of surplus inert minuteman icbm second and third stages being launched from the kwajalein meck launch site in the pacific range1415 early space explorationedit vandenberg launched the worlds first polar orbiting satellite discoverer i on 28 february 1959 the launch vehicle for this mission consisted of a thoragena combination5 the discoverer series of satellites provided other significant firsts for vandenberg for instance in august 1960 the data capsule was ejected from discoverer xiii in orbit and recovered from the pacific ocean to become the first manmade object ever retrieved from space a week later on 19 august the descending capsule from discoverer xiv was snared by an aircraft in flight for the first air recovery in history5 shrouded in a cover story of scientific research discoverer was actually the cover name for corona americas first photo reconnaissance satellite program the publicized discoverer series came to an end on 13 january 1962 after 37 launches or launch attempts5 over the years unmanned satellites of every description and purpose including international satellites were placed in orbit from vandenberg by a widening variety of boosters among the parade of newer space boosters are the titan iv march 1991 taurus march 1994 pegasus april 1995 delta ii february 1996 atlas iias december 1999 minotaur 2000 and beginning in late 2005 the falcon 1 the delta iv and atlas v vehicles5 the most ambitious air force endeavors at vandenberg were the manned orbiting laboratory mol and the space shuttle programs the mol vehicle

march 1966 president richard nixon canceled the estimated 3 billion program in june 1969 as a result of cost overruns completion delays emerging new technologies and the expense of fighting the vietnam war slc6 remained closed for the next decade5 space shuttleedit 1985 photo of space shuttle enterprise ov101 moving toward the shuttle assembly building at vandenberg afb space launch complex 6 aboard its specially designed cometto 76wheel transporter in the background are the payload changeout room and the payload preparation room in 1972 vandenberg was selected as the west coast space shuttle launch and landing site but it was never used as such space launch complex 6 slc6 pronounced as slick six originally built for the abandoned manned orbital laboratory project was extensively modified for shuttle operations over 4 billion was spent on the modifications to the complex and construction of associated infrastructure the original mobile service tower mst was lowered in height and two new flame ducts were added for the shuttles solid rocket boosters additional modifications or improvements included liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen storage tanks a payload preparation room payload changeout room a new launch tower with escape system for the shuttle crewmembers sound suppression system and water reclamation area and a shuttle assembly building were added to the original complex the existing 8500foot 2590 m runway and overruns on the north base flightline were lengthened to 15000 feet 4580 m to accommodate endofmission landings along with construction of the precision approach and path indicator papi lightslarge triangle arrows at both ends of the runway turnaround servicing and refurbishing of the space shuttle orbiter would be accomplished in the adjacent orbiter maintenance and checkout facility omcf the matedemate facility to load and unload the orbiter from the boeing 747 shuttle carrier aircraft sca was changed from the large structure found at dryden flight research center and kennedy space center to a transportable erector setlike orbiter lifting frame olf this facility design change was due to the possibility of needing to support a landing at a location where there was no facility to load the orbiter onto the sca the olf could be disassembled loaded onto two c5 aircraft shipped to the overseas orbiter landing site and reassembled to load the orbiter onto the boeing 747 to transport the orbiter from the omcf on north vandenberg afb to slc6 the 22mile 35 km route was upgraded to accommodate a 76wheeled vehicle built by commetto in italy specifically to carry the orbiter on its large flat deck utilizing the three external tank interface points versus towing the orbiter on its landing gear that long distance modification of slc6 to support polar missions had been problematic and expensive16 slc6 was still being prepared for its first shuttle launch mission sts62a targeted for 15 october 1986 when the challenger disaster grounded the shuttle fleet and set in motion a chain of events that finally led to the decision to cancel all west coast shuttle launches the orbiter transporter was sent to kennedy space center in florida after the vandenberg afb launch site was abandoned and was used to transport the orbiter from the orbiter processing facility to the vehicle assembly building persistent site technical problems and a joint decision by the air force and nasa to consolidate shuttle operations at the kennedy space center following the challenger disaster in 1986 resulted in the official termination of the shuttle program at vandenberg on 26 december 1989 had the space shuttle program been successful at slc6 the west coast operation would have contrasted with that at the kennedy space center by creating the orbiter stack directly on the launch pad rather than assembling it and then moving it three movable buildings on rails the launch tower mobile service building and payload changeout room were used to assemble the shuttle orbiter external tank and srbs these buildings were designed to protect the shuttle stack from high winds in the area and were used during a series of fit tests utilizing the space shuttle enterprise in 1985 delta ivedit since the demise of the shuttle program at vandenberg slc 6 was once again reconfigured this time to support polarorbit satellite launches by the new delta iv family of launch vehicles utilizing a common core booster for class sizes all the way up to and including the delta iv heavy launcher as it is currently configured the 132acre 53 ha launch site features structures similar to boeings delta iv slc37 launch site at cape canaveral air force station in florida with a fixed umbilical tower mobile service tower fixed pad erector launch control center and operations building and a horizontal integration facility slc6 also features a mobile assembly shelter that protects the rocket from adverse weather the first of the delta iv launch vehicles to fly from slc 6 successfully lifted off at 833 pm pdt on 27 june 2006 when a delta iv medium 42 rocket lofted nrol22 a classified satellite for the national reconnaissance office into orbit
