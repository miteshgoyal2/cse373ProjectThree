directtovideo from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about the type of film release for all time low live album see straight to dvd album directtovideo or straighttovideo refers to the release of a film to the public immediately on home video formats rather than a theatrical release or television broadcast1 because inferior sequels or prequels of largerbudget films may be released direct to video review references to directtovideo releases are often pejorativecitation needed directtovideo release has also become profitable for independent filmmakers and smaller companies2 contents 1 reasons for releasing direct to video 2 physical format releases 21 directtovideo films screened theatrically 22 directtodisc or dvd premiere 3 digital releases 31 directtoitunes 32 directtostream 4 the vcinema and ova markets in japan 5 see also 6 references 7 further reading reasons for releasing direct to videoedit a production studio may decide not to generally release a tv show or film for several possible reasons a low budget lack of support from a tv network negative reviews its controversial nature that it may appeal to a small niche market or a simple lack of general public interest studios limited in the annual number of films to which they grant cinematic releases may choose to pull the completed film from the theaters or never exhibit it in theaters at all studios then generate revenue through video sales and rentals3 directtovideo releases have historically carried a stigma of lower technical or artistic quality than theatrical releases4 some films released direct to video are films which have been completed but were never released in movie theaters this delay often occurs when a studio doubts a films commercial prospects justify a full cinema release or because its release window has closed in film industry slang such films are referred to as having been vaulted5 directtovideo releases can be done for films which cannot be shown theatrically due to controversial content or because the cost involved in a theatrical release is beyond the releasing company6 animated sequels and featurelength episodes of animated series are also often released in this fashion6 the walt disney company began making sequels to many of its animated films for video release beginning with the return of jafar the sequel to aladdin in 1994 and aladdin and the king of thieves the second sequel to aladdin in 1996 universal studios also began their long line of the land before time sequels that same year studios may also release sequels or spinoffs to a successful live action film straight to dvd due to a lack of budget in comparison to the original an example is the behind enemy lines series of films the family film segment is a major part of directtovideo sales according to the los angeles times often the downfall of liveaction family films at the box office is their strength on video their appeal is to families with young children who may go to only a couple of movies per year but who will watch many videos multiple times the teens and young adults who drive blockbuster box office statistics stay away from family movies7 during the golden age of porn in the 1970s many pornographic films were released in theatres some of which became some of the highestgrossing films in their release years and in the pornography industry altogether towards the 1980s porn began to shift to video release because video allowed the producers to work on extremely low budgets and dispense with some film production elements like scripts and the increased privacy and convenience of the format change were preferred by the target market during the 1990s pornographers began releasing content through paysites on the internet physical format releasesedit directtovideo films screened theatricallyedit occasionally a studio that makes a movie that was prepared as a directtovideo film will release it theatrically at the last minute due to the success of another film with a similar subject matter or an ultimate studio decision batman mask of the phantasm is an example of this however despite the movies critically acclaimed success its boxoffice performance was very poor which has been attributed to its last minute decision to be released theatrically the film had much better commercial success in its subsequent home video releases other times a directtovideo movie may get a limited theatrical screening in order to build excitement for the actual release of the video such as was done for 2010s justice league crisis on two earths batman the killing joke and planet hulk8 or 2013s sharknado directtodisc or dvd premiereedit as dvds gradually replaced vhs videocassettes the term directtodvd replaced directtovideo in some instances9 however the word video does not necessarily refer to videocassettes many publications continue to use the term directtovideo for dvds or bluray discs both discbased release types may also be referred to as directtodisc a new term sometimes used is dvd premiere dvdp10 such films can cost as little as 20 million11 about a third of the average cost of a hollywood release12 according to variety american pie band camp sold a million copies in one week despite retaining only two actors from the original trilogy13 some directtodvd releases recently have tended to feature actors who were formerly bankable stars in 2005 salaries for some of these directtodvd actors in the multimilliondollar range from 2 to 4 million jeanclaude van damme and 45 to 10 million steven seagal in some cases exceeding the actors theatrical rates11 digital releasesedit directtoitunesedit direct to itunes is an online distribution method that avoids all upfront dvd production marketing and distribution costs as well as upfront cinema distribution and marketing costs apple distributes the film for 30 of the revenue while an additional 10–15 may go to the person who formats the film for itunes compatibility14 the first independently produced featurelength motion picture to pursue the directtoitunes marketing scheme was ed burns purple violets which debuted on itunes on november 20 2007 it was the first featurelength film to premiere exclusively on itunes it was distributed exclusively on itunes at a price of us1499 for a month before being made available through other distribution channels15 the movie which was produced at a cost of 4 million had premiered at the tribeca film festival in april where it was reviewed positively but only received modest distribution offers14 at the time of the purple violets release most studios were not distributing via itunes early in the process and only walt disney studios which was the first movie studio to distribute via itunes14 was distributing at itunes simultaneously with dvd distribution16 it was not very common for consumers to make digital movie purchases at the time17 the polish brothers 2011 for lovers only which had virtually no production costs and was released to itunes on july 12 is regarded as the first profitable feature length directtoitunes product18 the directtoitunes method is also becoming common with both books and music when purple violets was released several short films had already been distributed through itunes previously marketing of short films had been prohibitive however apple distributed the february 25 2007 79th academy awards nominees for the animated shorts live action shorts and documentary shorts as well as half of the 2007 sundance film festival shorts beginning a new era14 directtostreamedit due to the growth of youtube and other videostreaming websites premieres of longform films increasingly occur through online streams longform films to premiere on youtube or other sites include home 2009 the cult of sincerity 2008 life in a day 2011 eyes and ears of god video surveillance of sudan 2012 and zeitgeist the movie 2007 in 2010 striker was the first indian film to premiere on youtube on the same day as it was premiered in theaters some releases are not only available only from digital services such as netflix but actually produced by them the vcinema and ova markets in japanedit see also original video animation and categoryjapanese directtovideo films japanese live action vcinema may serve as a stepping stone to greater things naoko iijima started her career appearing on late night tv variety and then focused on such vcinema titles as strawberry times 4 and zero woman final mission zero woman　警視庁０課の女 zero woman keishichō 0ka no onna before moving into a career in mainstream movies and tv cult director takashi miike has released quite a few of his works as vcinema perhaps preferring the freedom weather report girl 1995 starring kei mizutani is a rare case of a work being released to video and then recalled by the maker and released to theatres to considerable success vcinema may be used for the sequels to a successful feature film eg zero woman sasori kunoichi ninpoden baka yaro or pantsu no ana the content can be sexier or more violent than a mainstream feature film in the case of anime this is called original video animation sometimes capitalized and abbreviated ova or oav theyre often used to tell stories too short to fill a full tv season or to take creative risk without pressures from tv studios and sponsoring companies19 and were particularly common in the early 1990s sometimes ovas garner enough interest to justify commissioning a full tv show such as tenchi muyo el hazard and read or die with the convenience of the 13episode season format ovas are less common now the majority of ovas released in todays market are usually continuations or reworkings of recently completed tv shows for instance the dvd release of a tv show might as a sales hook include a bonus episode that was never broadcast see alsoedit video on demand b movie home video list of animated directtovideo
