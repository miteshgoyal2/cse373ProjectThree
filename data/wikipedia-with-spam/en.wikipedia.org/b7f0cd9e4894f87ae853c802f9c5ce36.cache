cuban exile early migrationsedit before the louisiana purchase and the adams–onís treaty of 1819 spanish florida and when divided during british occupation east florida and west florida including what is now florida and the gulf coast west to the mississippi river were provinces of the captaincy general of cuba captain general being the spanish title equivalent to the british colonial governor consequently cuban immigration to the us has a long history beginning in the spanish colonial period in 1565 when st augustine florida was established by pedro menéndez de avilés and hundreds of spanishcuban soldiers and their families moved from cuba to st augustine to establish a new life thousands of cuban settlers also immigrated to louisiana between 1778 and 1802 and texas during the period of spanish rulecitation needed since 1820 the cuban presence was more than 1000 people in 1870 the number of cuban immigrants increased to almost 12000 of which about 4500 resided in new york city about 3000 in new orleans and 2000 in key west the causes of these movements were both economic and political which intensified after 1860 when political factors played the predominant role in emigration as a result of deteriorating relations with the spanish metropolis the year 1869 marked the beginning of one of the most significant periods of emigration from cuba to the united states again centered on key west the exodus of hundreds of workers and businessmen was linked to the manufacture of tobacco the reasons are many the introduction of more modern techniques of elaboration of snuff the most direct access to its main market the united states the uncertainty about the future of the island which had suffered years of economic political and social unrest during the beginning of the ten years war against spanish rule it was an exodus of skilled workers precisely the class in the island that had succeeded in establishing a free labor sector amid a slave economy the manufacture of snuff by the cuban labor force became the most important source of income for key west between 1869 and 1900 tampa was added to such efforts with a strong migration of cubans which went from 720 inhabitants in 1880 to 5532 in 1890 however the second half of the 1890s marked the decline of the cuban immigrant population as an important part of it returned to the island to fight for independence the war accentuated cuban immigrant integration into american society whose numbers were significant more than 12000 people6 statue of jose martí at the circulo cubano cuban club ybor city key west and tampa floridaedit in the mid to late 19th century several cigar manufacturers moved their operations to key west to get away from growing disruptions as cubans sought independence from spanish colonial rule many cuban cigar workers followed the cuban government had even established a grammar school in key west to help preserve cuban culture there children learned folk songs and patriotic hymns such as la bayamesa the cuban national anthem in 1885 vicente martinez ybor moved his cigar operations from key west to the town of tampa florida to escape labor strife ybor city was designed as a modified company town and it quickly attracted thousands of cuban workers from key west and cuba west tampa another new cigar manufacturing community was founded nearby in 1892 and also grew quickly between these communities the tampa bay areas cuban population grew from almost nothing to the largest in florida in just over a decade and the city as a whole grew from a village of approximately 1000 residents in 1885 to over 16000 by 1900 both ybor city and west tampa were instrumental in cubas eventual independence7 inspired by revolutionaries such as jose martí who visited florida several times tampaarea cubans and their sympathetic neighbors donated money equipment and sometimes their lives to the cause of cuba libre8 after the spanish–american war some cubans returned to their native land but many chose to stay in the us due to the physical and economic devastation caused by years of fighting on the island9 other early waves 1900–1959edit several other small waves of cuban emigration to the us occurred in the early 20th century 1900–1959 most settled in florida and the northeast us the majority of an estimated 100000 cubans arriving in that time period usually came for economic reasons the great depression of 1929 volatile sugar prices and migrant farm labor contractscitation needed but included antibatista refugees fleeing the military dictatorship which had prous diplomatic ties during the 20s and 30s emigration from cuba to us territory basically comprised workers looking for jobs mainly in new york and new jersey they were classified as labor migrants and workers much like other immigrants in the area at that time thus migrated more than 40149 in the first decade encouraged by us immigration facilities at the time and more than 43400 by the end of the 30scitation needed subsequently the flow of cubans to the united states fluctuated due to both the domestic situation in the 40s and 50s in cuba and us immigration policies plus intermittent antiimmigrant sentiment cuban migration in those years included in addition to workers a small mass of the population who could afford to leave the country and live abroad the us was considered a favored destination by the cuban bourgeoisie and the middle classes of society to send their children to school take vacations and bring some of their capital to establish small and mediumsized businessescitation needed the cuban population officially registered in the united states for 1958 was around 125000 people including descendants of these more than 50000 remained in the united states after the revolution of 19596 postcastro revolution 1959–2016edit after the cuban revolution led by fidel castro in 1959 a cuban exodus began as the new government allied itself with the soviet union and began to introduce communism the first cubans to come to america after the revolution were those affiliated with former dictator fulgencio batista next were cubas professionals most cuban americans that arrived in the united states initially came from cubas educated upper and middle classes centered in cubas capital havana this middle class arose in the period after the platt amendment when cuba became one of the most successful countries in latin america between december 1960 and october 1962 more than 14000 cuban children arrived alone in the us their parents were afraid that their children were going to be sent to some soviet bloc countries to be educatedcitation needed and they decided to send them to the states as soon as possiblecitation needed this program was called operation peter pan operacion pedro pan when the children arrived in miami they were met by representatives of catholic charities and they were sent to live with relatives if they had any or were sent to foster homes orphanages or boarding schools until their parents could leave cuba from 1965 to 1973 there was another wave of immigration known as the freedom flights in order to provide aid to recently arrived cuban immigrants the united states congress passed the cuban adjustment act in 1966 the cuban refugee program provided more than 13 billion of direct financial assistance they also were eligible for public assistance medicare free english courses scholarships and lowinterest college loanscitation needed some banks pioneered loans for exiles who did not have collateral or credit but received help in getting a business loan these loans enabled many cuban americans to secure funds and start up their own businesses with their cubanowned businesses and low cost of living miami florida and union city new jersey dubbed havana on the hudson1011 were the preferred destinations for many immigrants and soon became the main centers for cubanamerican culture according to author lisandro perez miami was not particularly attractive to cubans prior to the 1960s12 it was not until the exodus of the cuban exiles in 1959 that miami started to become a preferred destination westchester within miamidade county was the area most densely populated by cubans and cuban americans in the united states followed by hialeah in second13 communities like miami tampa and union city which cuban americans have made their home have experienced a profound cultural impact as a result as seen in such aspects of their local culture as cuisine fashion music entertainment and cigarmaking1415 1980sedit another large wave an estimated 125000 people of cuban immigration occurred in the early 1980s with the mariel boatlifts most of the marielitos were people wanting to escape from communism and have succeeded in establishing their roots in the uscitation needed fidel castro sent some 20000 criminals directly from cuban prisons as well as mentally ill persons from cuban mental institutions with the alleged double purpose of cleaning up cuban society and poisoning the usa those people were labeled unadmissible by the us government and with time through many negotiations have been returned to cubacitation needed mid1990s to 2000sedit since the mid1990s after the implementation of the wet feet dry feet policy immigration patterns changed many cuban immigrants departed from the southern and western coasts of cuba and arrived at the yucatán peninsula in mexico many landed on isla mujeres from there cuban immigrants traveled to the texasmexico border and found asylum many of the cubans who did not have family in miami settled in houston this has caused houstons cubanamerican community to increase in size the term dusty foot refers to cubans emigrating to the us through mexico in 2005 the department of homeland security had abandoned the approach of detaining every dry foot cuban who crosses through texas and began a policy allowing most cubans to obtain immediate parole16 jorge ferragut a cuban immigrant who founded casa cuba an agency that assists cuban immigrants arriving in texas said in a 2008 article that many cuban immigrants of the first decade of the 21st century left due to economic instead of political issues17 by october 2008 mexico and cuba created an agreement to prevent immigration of cubans through mexico1819 in recent yearswhen puerto rico has become a major dropoff point for cubans trying to reach the united states illegally as a us commonwealth puerto rico is seen as a stepping stone for cubans trying to get to the continental us though puerto rico itself is home to a number of cubans20 immigration policyedit before the 1980s all refugees from cuba were welcomed into the united states as political refugees this changed in the 1990s so that only cubans who reach us soil are granted refuge under the wet foot dry foot policy while representing a tightening of us immigration policy the wet foot dry foot policy still affords cubans a privileged position relative to other immigrants to the us this privileged position is the source of a certain friction between cuban americans and other latino citizens and residents in the united states adding to the tension caused by the divergent foreign policy interests pursued by conservative cuban americans cuban immigration also continues with an allotted number of cubans 20000 per year provided legal us visascitation needed according to a us census 1970 report cuban americans as well as latinos lived in all fifty states but as later census reports demonstrated the majority of cuban immigrants settled in south florida a new trend in the late 1990s showed that fewer immigrants arrived from cuba than previously while usborn cuban americans moved out of their enclaves other nationalities settled there21 in late 1999 us news media focused on the case of elián gonzález the sixyearold cuban boy caught in a custody battle between his relatives in miami and his father in cuba after the boys mother died trying to bring him to the united states on april 22 2000 ice now uscis agents took elián gonzález to the cuban interests section in washington dc from there his father took him back to cubacitation needed on january 12 2017 president barack obama announced the immediate cessation of the wet feet dry feet policy22 the cuban government agreed to accept the return of cuban nationals23 beginning with the united states–cuban thaw in 2014 anticipation of the end of the policy had led to increased numbers of cuban immigrants24 demographicsedit in the census in 2000 there were 1241685 cuban americans and in the 2010 census there were 1785547 both native and foreign born and represented 35 of all hispanics and 058 of the us
