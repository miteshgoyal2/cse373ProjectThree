policymakers following an afternoon meeting with nixonford administration officials dick cheney and donald rumsfeld in 1974 in which he reportedly sketched the curve on a napkin to illustrate his argument11 the term laffer curve was coined by jude wanniski who was also present the basic concept was not new laffer himself says he learned it from ibn khaldun and john maynard keynes12 a simplified view of the theory is that tax revenues would be zero if tax rates were either 0 or 100 and somewhere in between 0 and 100 is a tax rate which maximizes total revenue laffers postulate was that the tax rate that maximizes revenue was at a much lower level than previously believed so low that current tax rates were above the level where revenue is maximized numerous leading economists have rejected the view that a tax rate cut of current federal us income taxes can lead to increased tax revenue when asked whether a “cut in federal income tax rates in the us right now would raise taxable income enough so that the annual total tax revenue would be higher within five years than without the tax cut” 96 of economists surveyed in 2012 disagreed in response to this survey question richard thaler of the university of chicago joked “that’s a laffer” 13 according to greg mankiw chairman of the council of economic advisers under president george w bush most economists have been very skeptical of laffers contention that decreases in tax rates could increase tax revenue at least in the united states in his textbook mankiw states there was little evidence for laffers view that us tax rates had in fact reached such extreme levels14 laffer is currently an economic adviser to kansas governor sam brownback who in 2012 zeroed out state tax liability for approximately 330000 of the top wage earners in the state15 the state which had previously had a budget surplus experienced a budget deficit of about 200 million in 2012 drastic cuts to state funding for education and
