nuclear attack many united states air force strategic missile wing controllers prove unwilling to turn a required key to launch a missile strike such refusals convince john mckittrick and other systems engineers at norad that missile launch control centers must be automated without human intervention control is given to a norad supercomputer wopr programmed to continuously run war simulations and learn over time david lightman a bright but unmotivated seattle high school student and hacker uses his computer to break into the school districts computer system and change his grades he does the same for his friend and classmate jennifer mack later while war dialing numbers in sunnyvale california to find a computer game company he connects with a system that does not identify itself asking for games he finds a list that starts with chess checkers backgammon and poker as well as titles like theaterwide biotoxic and chemical warfare and global thermonuclear war but cannot proceed further two hacker friends explain the concept of a backdoor password and suggest tracking down the falken referenced in falkens maze the first game listed david discovers that stephen falken was an early artificial intelligence researcher and guesses correctly that his dead sons name joshua is the password david does not know that the sunnyvale phone number connects to wopr at the cheyenne mountain complex he starts a game of global thermonuclear war playing as the soviet union the computer starts a simulation that briefly convinces the military personnel at norad that actual soviet nuclear missiles are inbound while they defuse the situation wopr nonetheless continues the simulation to trigger the scenario and win the game as it does not understand the difference between reality and simulation it continuously feeds false data such as soviet bomber incursions and submarine deployments to norad pushing them into raising the defcon level and toward a retaliation that will start world war iii david learns the true nature of his actions from a news broadcast and fbi agents arrest him and take him to norad he realizes that wopr is behind the norad alerts but because he fails to convince mckittrick he faces espionage charges david escapes norad by joining a tourist group and with jennifers help travels to the oregon island where falken lives david and jennifer find that falken has become despondent and believes that nuclear war is inevitable that it is as futile as a game of tictactoe between two experienced players the teenagers convince falken that he should return to norad to stop wopr the computer stages a massive soviet first strike with hundreds of missiles submarines and bombers believing the attack to be genuine norad prepares to retaliate falken david and jennifer convince military officials to cancel the second strike and ride out the attack wopr tries to launch the missiles itself however using a bruteforce attack to obtain the launch code without humans in the control centers as a safeguard the computer will trigger a mass launch all attempts to log in and order joshua to cancel the countdown fail and all weapons will launch if the computer is disabled falken and david direct the computer to play tictactoe against itself this results in a long string of draws forcing the computer to learn the concept of futility and nowin scenarios wopr obtains the missile code but before launching it cycles through all the nuclear war scenarios it has devised finding they too all result in stalemates having discovered the concept of mutual assured destruction winner none the computer tells falken that it has concluded that nuclear war is a strange game in which the only winning move is not to play wopr relinquishes control of norad and the missiles and offers to play a nice game of chess castedit matthew broderick as david lightman dabney coleman as dr john mckittrick john wood as dr stephen falken and the voice

in 1979 when writers walter f parkes and lawrence lasker developed an idea for a script called the genius about a dying scientist and the only person in the world who understands him — a rebellious kid whos too smart for his own good lasker was inspired by a television special presented by peter ustinov on several geniuses including stephen hawking lasker said i found the predicament hawking was in fascinating — that he might one day figure out the unified field theory and not be able to tell anyone because of his progressive als so there was this idea that hed need a successor and who would that be maybe this kid a juvenile delinquent whose problem was that nobody realized he was too smart for his environment the concept of computers and hacking as part of the film was not yet present1 the genius began its transformation into wargames when parkes and lasker met peter schwartz from the stanford research institute there was a new subculture of extremely bright kids developing into what would become known as hackers said schwartz schwartz made the connection between youth computers gaming and the military1 parkes and lasker also met with computersecurity expert willis ware of rand corporation who assured them that even a secure military computer might have remote access so users could work from home on weekends encouraging the screenwriters to continue with the project2 parkes and lasker came up with several different militarythemed plotlines prior to the final story one version of the script had an early version of wopr named uncle ollie or oli omnipresent laser interceptor a spacebased defensive laser run by an intelligent program but this idea was discarded because it was too speculative1 director john badham coined the name wopr feeling that the name of norads siop single integrated operational plan was boring and told you nothing3 the name wopr played off the whopper hamburger and a general sense of something going whop3 the wopr computer as seen in the film was a prop created in culver city california by members of the international alliance of theatrical stage employees local 444 it was designed by production designer credited as visual consultant geoffrey kirkland based on some pictures he had of early tabulating machines and metal furniture consoles and cabinets used particularly in the us military in the 1940s and 50s they were adapted in drawings and concepts by art director angelo p graham wopr was operated by a crewmember sitting inside the computer entering commands into an apple ii at the directors instruction4 the prop was broken up for scrap after production was completed a replica was built for a 2006 att commercial5 david lightman was modeled on david scott lewis a hacking enthusiast parkes and lasker met16 falken was inspired by and named after stephen hawking with the appearance of john lennon who was interested in the role but was murdered in new york while the script was in development general beringer was based on general james v hartinger usaf the thencommanderinchief of norad who parkes and lasker met while visiting the base and who like beringer favored keeping humans in the decision loop1 filmingedit martin brest was originally hired as director but was fired after 12 days of shooting because of a disagreement with the producers7 and replaced with john badham several of the scenes shot by brest remain in the final film badham said that brest had taken a somewhat dark approach to the story and the way it was shot it was like broderick and sheedy were doing some nazi undercover thing so it was my job to make it seem like they were having fun and that it was exciting according to badham broderick and sheedy were stiff as boards when they came onto the sound stage having both brests dark vision and the idea that they would soon be fired badham did 12 to 14 takes of the first shot to loosen the actors up at one point badham decided to have a race with the two actors around the sound stage with the one who came last having to sing a song to the crew badham lost and sang the happy wanderer the silliest song he could think of8 tom mankiewicz says he wrote some additional scenes during shooting that were used9 releaseedit wargames did well at the north american box office earning 79567667 the fifthhighest of 1983110 the film was screened out of competition at the 1983 cannes film festival11 receptionedit critical responseedit the film received critical acclaim film critic roger ebert gave the film four out of four stars calling it an amazingly entertaining thriller and one of the best films so far this year with a wonderful ending12 softline praised the film as being completely original unlike other computerrelated films like tron that could and do exist in substantially the same form with some other plot wargames could not exist if the microcomputer did not exist it takes the micro and telecommunications as a given—part of the middleclass american landscape the magazine praised the film as very funny excruciatingly suspenseful and endlessly inventive this movie is right on the mark authentic even when highly improbable13 computer gaming world stated that wargames is plausible enough to intrigue and terrifying enough to excite it makes one think as well as feel all the way raised several moral questions about technology and society and recommended the film to computer hobbyists of all kinds14 leonard maltin gave it a mixed review calling it fail safe for the pacman generation and entertaining to a point he concluded incidentally its easy to see why this was so popular with kids  most of the adults in the film are boobs15 currently film review aggregator rotten tomatoes reports that 93 of sampled critics give the film positive reviews and that it receives a rating average of 76 out of 1016 accoladesedit wargames was nominated for three academy awards — best cinematography william a fraker sound michael j kohut carlos delarios aaron rochin willie d burton and writing screenplay written directly for the screen lawrence lasker walter f parkes117 the company that provided the large screens used to display the tactical situations seen in the norad set employed a new design that was superbright enabling the displays to be filmed live the set was more visually impressive than the actual norad facilities at the time1 the animations seen on the norad displays produced by colin cantwellon were created using hewlett packard hp 9845c computers driving monochrome hp 1345a vector displays which were stillfilmed through successive colorfilters each frame took approximately one minute to produce and 50000 feet of negatives were produced over seven months the animations were projected live onto the screens from behind using 16mm film so they were visible to the actors and no postproduction work was needed18 for this the company was awarded an academy scientific and technical award influenceedit bulletin board system bbs operators reported an unusual rise in activity in 1984 which at least one sysop attributed to wargames introducing viewers to modems19 the scenes showing lightmans computer dialing every number in sunnyvale led to the term war dialing earlier known as demon dialing a technique of using a modem to scan a list of telephone numbers to search for unknown computers and indirectly to the newer term wardriving20 president reagan a family friend of lasker watched the film and discussed the plot with members of congress1 his advisers and the joint chiefs of staff reagans interest in the film is credited with leading to the enactment 18 months later of nsdd145 the first presidential directive on computer security2 video gamesedit a video game wargames was released for the colecovision in 1983 and ported to the atari 8bit family and commodore 64 in 1984 it played similarly to the norad side of the global thermonuclear war game where the united states had to be defended from a soviet strike by placing bases and weapons at strategic points wargames defcon 1 a realtime strategy game that was only loosely related to the film was released for the playstation and pc in 1998 a tilematching video game wargames wopr was released for ios and android devices in 20122122 a game inspired by the film called computer war from thorn emi in which the
