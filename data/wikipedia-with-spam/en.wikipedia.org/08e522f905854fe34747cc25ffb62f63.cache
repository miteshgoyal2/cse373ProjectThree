of things iot is the network of physical devices vehicles home appliances and other items embedded with electronics software sensors actuators and network connectivity which enable these objects to connect and exchange data123 each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing internet infrastructure experts estimate that the iot will consist of about 30 billion objects by 20204 the iot allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure5 creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computerbased systems and resulting in improved efficiency accuracy and economic benefit in addition to reduced human intervention6789 when iot is augmented with sensors and actuators the technology becomes an instance of the more general class of cyberphysical systems which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids virtual power plants smart homes intelligent transportation and smart cities things in the iot sense can refer to a wide variety of devices such as heart monitoring implants biochip transponders on farm animals cameras streaming live feeds of wild animals in coastal waters10 automobiles with builtin sensors dna analysis devices for environmentalfoodpathogen monitoring11 or field operation devices that assist firefighters in search and rescue operations12 legal scholars suggest regarding things as an inextricable mixture of hardware software data and service13 these devices collect useful data with the help of various existing technologies and then autonomously flow the data between other devices14 the quick expansion of internetconnected objects is also expected to generate large amounts of data from diverse locations with the consequent necessity for quick aggregation of the data and an increase in the need to index store and process such data more effectively in recent years with the massive growth in global cyber threat there has been a significant rise in exploitation of iot technologies for committing cyber terror crimes15 the term the internet of things was coined by kevin ashton of procter gamble later

convergence of multiple technologies including ubiquitous wireless communication realtime analytics machine learning commodity sensors and embedded systems12 this means that the traditional fields of embedded systems wireless sensor networks control systems automation including home and building automation and others all contribute to enabling the internet of things17 the concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as early as 1982 with a modified coke machine at carnegie mellon university becoming the first internetconnected appliance18 able to report its inventory and whether newly loaded drinks were cold19 mark weisers seminal 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing the computer of the 21st century as well as academic venues such as ubicomp and percom produced the contemporary vision of iot2021 in 1994 reza raji described the concept in ieee spectrum as moving small packets of data to a large set of nodes so as to integrate and automate everything from home appliances to entire factories22 between 1993 and 1996 several companies proposed solutions like microsofts at work or novells nest however only in 1999 did the field start gathering momentum bill joy envisioned device to device d2d communication as part of his six webs framework presented at the world economic forum at davos in 199923 the concept of the internet of things became popular in 1999 through the autoid center at mit and related marketanalysis publications24 radiofrequency identification rfid was seen by kevin ashton one of the founders of the original autoid center as a prerequisite for the internet of things at that point25 ashton prefers the phrase internet for things26 if all objects and people in daily life were equipped with identifiers computers could manage and inventory them272829 besides using rfid the tagging of things may be achieved through such technologies as near field communication barcodes qr codes and digital watermarking3031 in its original interpretationwhen one of the first consequences of implementing the internet of things by equipping all objects in the world with minuscule identifying devices or machinereadable identifiers would be to transform daily life3233 for instance instant and ceaseless inventory control would become ubiquitous33 a persons ability to interact with objects could be altered remotely based on immediate or present needs in accordance with existing enduser agreements25 for example such technology could grant motionpicture publishers much more control over enduser private devices by remotely enforcing copyright restrictions and digital rights management so the ability of a customer who bought a bluray disc to watch the movie could become dependent on the copyright holders decision similar to circuit citys failed divxcitation needed a significant transformation is to extend things from the data generated from devices to objects in the physical space the thoughtmodel for future interconnection environment was proposed in 200434 the model includes the notion of the ternary universe consists of the physical world virtual world and mental world and a multilevel reference architecture with the nature and devices at the bottom level followed by the level of the internet sensor network and mobile network and intelligent humanmachine communities at the top level which supports geographically dispersed users to cooperatively accomplish tasks and solve problems by using the network to actively promote the flow of material energy techniques information knowledge and services in this environment35 this thought model envisioned the development trend of the internet of things applicationsedit a nest learning thermostat reporting on energy usage and local weather a 2012 internet refrigerator from lg the applications for internet connected devices are extensive multiple categorizations have been suggested most of which agree on a separation between consumer enterprise business and infrastructure applications3637 george osborne the former british chancellor of the exchequer posited that the internet of things is the next stage of the information revolution and referenced the interconnectivity of everything from urban transport to medical devices to household appliances38 the ability to network embedded devices with limited cpu memory and power resources means that iot finds applications in nearly every field39 such systems could be in charge of collecting information in settings ranging from natural ecosystems to buildings and factories40 thereby finding applications in fields of environmental sensing and urban planning41 intelligent shopping systems for example could monitor specific users purchasing habits in a store by tracking their specific mobile phones these users could then be provided with special offers on their favorite products or even location of items that they need which their fridge has automatically conveyed to the phone4243 additional examples of sensing and actuating are reflected in applications that deal with heat water electricity and energy management as well as cruiseassisting transportation systems4445 other applications that the internet of things can provide is enabling extended home security features and home automation46 the concept of an internet of living things has been proposed to describe networks of biological sensors that could use cloudbased analyses to allow users to study dna or other molecules4748 consumer applicationedit a growing portion of iot devices are created for consumer use examples of consumer applications include connected car entertainment home automation also known as smart home devices wearable technology quantified self connected health and appliances such as washerdryers robotic vacuums air purifiers ovens or refrigeratorsfreezers that use wifi for remote monitoring49 consumer iot provides new opportunities for user experience and interfacescitation needed some consumer applications have been criticized for their lack of redundancy and their inconsistency leading to a popular parody known as the “internet of shit”50 companies have been criticized for their rush into iot creating devices of questionable value51 and not setting up stringent security standards52 smart homeedit iot devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation also known as domotics large smart home systems utilize a main hub or controller to provide users with a central control for all of their devices one application of the smart home is to provide assistance for disabled and elderly individuals these home systems utilize assistive technology to accommodate an owners specific disabilities53 voice control can assist users with sight and mobility limitations while alert systems can be connected directly to cochlear implants worn by hearing impaired users54 they can also be equipped with additional safety features these features can include sensors that monitor for medical emergencies such as falls or seizures55 smart home technology applied in this way can provide users with more freedom and a higher quality of life56 enterpriseedit the term enterprise iot or eiot is used to refer to all devices used in business and corporate settings by 2019 it is estimated the eiot will account for nearly 40 or 91 billion devices large companies will see a more immediate profit from the widespread automation that iot devices36 mediaedit this section may be too technical for most readers to understand please help improve it to make it understandable to nonexperts without removing the technical details the talk page may contain suggestions march 2016 learn how and when to remove this template message in order to hone the manner in which things media and big data are interconnected it is first necessary to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process it has been suggested by nick couldry and joseph turow that practitioners in media approach big data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals the industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers magazines or television shows and instead tap into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations the ultimate aim is of course to serve or convey a message or content that is statistically speaking in line with the consumers mindset for example publishing environments are increasingly tailoring the messages articles to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various datamining activities57 the media industries process big data in a dual interconnected mannercitation needed targeting of consumers for advertising by marketers datacapture thus the internet of things creates an opportunity to measure collect and analyse an everincreasing variety of behavioural statistics crosscorrelation of this data could revolutionise the targeted marketing of products and services58 for example as noted by danny meadowsklue the combination of analytics for conversion tracking with behavioural targeting has unlocked a new level of precision that enables display advertising to be focused on the devices of people with relevant interests59 big data and the iot work in conjunction from a media perspective data is the key derivative of device interconnectivity whilst being pivotal in allowing clearer accuracy in targeting the internet of things therefore transforms the media industry companies and even governments opening up a new era of economic growth and competitiveness60 the wealth of data generated by this industry will allow practitioners in advertising and media to gain an elaborate layer on the present targeting mechanisms used by the industry61 infrastructure managementedit monitoring and controlling operations of urban and rural infrastructures like bridges railway tracks on and offshore windfarms is a key application of the iot62 the iot infrastructure can be used for monitoring any events or changes in structural conditions that can compromise safety and increase risk it can also be used for scheduling repair and maintenance activities in an efficient manner by coordinating tasks between different service providers and users of these facilities40 iot devices can also be used to control critical infrastructure like bridges to provide access to ships usage of iot devices for monitoring and operating infrastructure is likely to improve incident management and emergency response coordination and quality of service uptimes and reduce costs of operation in all infrastructure related areas63 even areas such as waste management can benefit 64 from automation and optimization that could be brought in by the iot65 manufacturingedit network control and management of manufacturing equipment asset and situation management or manufacturing process control bring the iot within the realm of industrial applications and smart manufacturing as well66 the iot intelligent systems enable rapid manufacturing of new products dynamic response to product demands and realtime optimization of manufacturing production and supply chain networks by networking machinery sensors and control systems together40 digital control systems to automate process controls operator tools and service information systems to optimize plant safety and security are within the purview of the iot62 but it also extends itself to asset management via predictive maintenance statistical evaluation and measurements to maximize reliability67 smart industrial management systems can also be integrated with the smart grid thereby enabling realtime energy optimization measurements automated controls plant optimization health and safety management and other functions are provided by a large number of networked sensors40 the term industrial internet of things iiot is often encountered in the manufacturing industries referring to the industrial subset of the iot iiot in manufacturing could generate so much business value that it will eventually lead to the fourth industrial revolution so the socalled industry 40 it is estimated that in the future successful companies will be able to increase their revenue through internet of things by creating new business models and improve productivity exploit analytics for innovation and transform workforce68 the potential of growth by implementing iiot will generate 12 trillion of global gdp by 203068 design architecture of cyberphysical systemsenabled manufacturing system69 while connectivity and data acquisition are imperative for iiot they should not be the purpose rather the foundation and path to something bigger among all the technologies predictive maintenance is probably a relatively easier win since it is applicable to existing assets and management systems the objective of intelligent maintenance systems is to reduce unexpected downtime and increase productivity and to realize that alone would generate around up to 30 over the total maintenance costs68 industrial big data analytics will play a vital role in manufacturing asset predictive maintenance although that is not the only capability of industrial big data7071 cyberphysical systems cps is the core technology of industrial big data and it will be an interface between human and the cyber world cyberphysical systems can be designed by following the 5c connection conversion cyber cognition configuration architecture69 and it will transform the collected data into actionable information and eventually interfere with the physical assets to optimize processescitation needed an iotenabled intelligent system of such cases was proposed in 2001 and later demonstrated in 2014 by the national science foundation industryuniversity collaborative research center for intelligent maintenance systems ims at the university of cincinnati on a band saw machine in imts 2014 in chicago727374 band saw machines are not necessarily expensive but the band saw belt expenses are enormous since they degrade much faster however without sensing and intelligent analytics it can be only determined by experience when the band saw belt will actually break the developed prognostics system will be able to recognize and monitor the degradation of band saw belts even if the condition is changing advising users when is the best time to replace band saw this will significantly improve user experience and operator safety and ultimately save on costs74 agricultureedit the iot contributes significantly towards innovating farming methods1 farming challenges caused by population growth and climate change have made it one of the first industries to utilize the iot the integration of wireless sensors with agricultural mobile apps and cloud platforms helps in collecting vital information pertaining to the environmental conditions75 – temperature rainfall humidity wind speed pest infestation soil humus content or nutrients besides others – linked with a farmland can be used to improve and automate farming techniques take informed decisions to improve quality and quantity and minimize risks and wastes the appbased field or crop monitoring also lowers the hassles of managing crops at multiple locations for example farmers can now detect which areas have been fertilised or mistakenly missed if the land is too dry and predict future yields energy managementedit integration of sensing and actuation systems connected to the internet is likely to optimize energy consumption as a whole40 it is expected that iot devices will be integrated into all forms of energy consuming devices switches power outlets bulbs televisions etc and be able to communicate with the utility supply company in order to effectively balance power generation and energy usage76 such devices would also offer the opportunity for users to remotely control their devices or centrally manage them via a cloudbased interface and enable advanced functions like scheduling eg remotely powering on or off heating systems controlling ovens changing lighting conditions etc40 besides homebased energy management the iot is especially relevant to the smart grid since it provides systems to gather and act on energy and powerrelated information in an automated fashion with the goal to improve the efficiency reliability economics and sustainability of the production and distribution of electricity76 using advanced metering infrastructure ami devices connected to the internet backbone electric utilities can not only collect data from enduser connections but also manage other distribution automation devices like transformers and reclosers40 environmental monitoringedit environmental monitoring applications of the iot typically use sensors to assist in environmental protection77 by monitoring air or water quality10 atmospheric or soil conditions78 and can even include areas like monitoring the movements of wildlife and their habitats79 development of resourceconstrained devices connected to the internet also means that other applications like earthquake or tsunami earlywarning systems can also be used by emergency services to provide more effective aid iot devices in this application typically span a large geographic area and can also be mobile40 it has been argued that the standardization iot brings to wireless sensing will revolutionize this area80 building and home automationedit iot devices can be used to monitor and control the mechanical electrical and electronic systems used in various types of buildings eg public and private industrial institutions or residential40 in home automation and building automation systems in this context three main areas are being covered in literature81 the integration of the internet with building energy management systems in order to create energy efficient and iot driven “smart buildings”81 the possible means of realtime monitoring for reducing energy consumption and monitoring occupant behaviors81 the integration of smart devices in the built environment and how they might be used in future applications81 metropolitan scale deploymentsedit there are several planned or ongoing largescale deployments of the iot to enable better management of cities and systems for example songdo south korea the first of its kind fully equipped and wired smart city is on near completion nearly everything in this city is planned to be wired connected and turned into a constant stream of data that would be monitored and analyzed by an array of computers with little or no human interventioncitation needed another application is a currently undergoing project in santander spain for this deployment two approaches have been adopted this city of 180000 inhabitants has already seen 18000 city application downloads for their smartphones this application is connected to 10000 sensors that enable services like parking search environmental monitoring digital city agenda among others city context information is used in this deployment so as to benefit merchants through a spark deals mechanism based on city behavior that aims at maximizing the impact of each notification82 other examples of largescale deployments underway include the sinosingapore guangzhou knowledge city83 work on improving air and water quality reducing noise pollution and increasing transportation efficiency in san jose california84 and smart traffic management in western singapore85 french company sigfox commenced building an ultranarrowband wireless data network in the san francisco bay area in 2014 the first business to achieve such a deployment in the us8687 it subsequently announced it would set up a total of 4000 base stations to cover a total of 30 cities in the us by the end of 2016 making it the largest iot network coverage provider in the country thus far8889 another example of a large deployment is the one completed by new york waterways in new york city to connect all the citys vessels and be able to monitor them live 247 the network was designed and engineered by fluidmesh networks a chicagobased company developing wireless networks for critical applications the nyww network is currently providing coverage on the hudson river east river and upper new york bay with the wireless network in place ny waterway is able to take control of its fleet and passengers in a way that was not previously possible new applications can include security energy and fleet management digital signage public wifi paperless ticketing and others90 other fields of applicationedit medical and healthcareedit iot devices can be used to enable remote health monitoring and emergency notification systems these health monitoring devices can range from blood pressure and heart rate monitors to advanced devices capable of monitoring specialized implants such as pacemakers fitbit electronic wristbands or advanced hearing aids40 some hospitals have begun implementing smart beds that can detect when they are occupied and when a patient is attempting to get up it can also adjust itself to ensure appropriate pressure and support is applied to the patient without the manual interaction of nurses91 specialized sensors can also be equipped within living spaces to monitor the health and general wellbeing of senior citizens while also ensuring that proper treatment is being administered and assisting people regain lost mobility via therapy as well92 other consumer devices to encourage healthy living such as connected scales or wearable heart monitors are also a possibility with the iot93 more and more endtoend health monitoring iot platforms are coming up for antenatal and chronic patients helping one manage health vitals and recurring medication requirementscitation needed the research development corporation deka a company that creates prosthetic limbs has created a batterypowered arm that uses myoelectricity a device that converts muscle group sensations into motor control the arm is nicked named luke arm after luke skywalker star wars94 transportationedit digital variable speedlimit sign the iot can assist in the integration of communications control and information processing across various transportation systems application of the iot extends to all aspects of transportation systems ie the vehicle the infrastructure and the driver or user dynamic interaction between these components of a transport system enables inter and intra vehicular communication smart traffic control smart parking electronic toll collection systems logistic and fleet management vehicle control and safety and road assistance4095 in logistics and fleet management for example the iot platform can continuously monitor the location and conditions of cargo and assets via wireless sensors and send specific alerts when management exceptions occur delays damages thefts etc trends and characteristicsedit technology roadmap internet of things the interconnection via the internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects enabling them to send and receive data intelligenceedit ambient intelligence and autonomous control are not part of the original concept of the internet of things ambient intelligence and autonomous control do not necessarily require internet structures either however there is a shift in research to integrate the concepts of the internet of things and autonomous control with initial outcomes towards this direction considering objects as the driving force for autonomous iotcitation needed in the future the internet of things may be a nondeterministic and open network in which autoorganized or intelligent entities web services soa components virtual objects avatars will be interoperable and able to act independently pursuing their own objectives or shared ones depending on the context circumstances or environments autonomous behavior through the collection and reasoning of context information as well as the objects ability to detect changes in the environment faults affecting sensors and introduce suitable mitigation measures constitute a major research trend96 clearly needed to provide credibility to the iot technology modern iot products and solutions in the marketplace use a variety of different technologies to support such contextaware automation but more sophisticated forms of intelligence are requested to permit sensor units to be deployed in real environmentscitation needed architectureedit the system will likely be an example of eventdriven architecture97 bottomup made based on the context of processes and operations in realtime and will consider any subsidiary level therefore model driven and functional approaches will coexist with new ones able to treat exceptions and unusual evolution of processes multiagent systems badsc etccitation needed in an internet of things the meaning of an event will not necessarily be based on a deterministic or syntactic model but would instead be based on the context of the event itself this will also be a semantic web98 consequently it will not necessarily need common standards that would not be able to address every context or use some actors services components avatars will accordingly be selfreferenced and if ever needed adaptive to existing common standards predicting everything would be no more than defining a global finality for everything that is just not possible with any of the current topdown approaches and standardizationscitation needed building on top of the internet of things the web of things is an architecture for the application layer of the internet of things looking at the convergence of data from iot devices into web applications to create innovative usecases in order to program and control the flow of information in the internet of things a predicted architectural direction is being called bpm everywhere which is a blending of traditional process management with process mining and special capabilities to automate the control of large numbers of coordinated devicescitation needed network architectureedit 99 the internet of things requires huge scalability in the network space to handle the surge of devices ietf 6lowpan would be used to connect devices to ip networks with billions of devices100 being added to the internet space ipv6 will play a major role in handling the network layer scalability ietfs constrained application protocol zeromq and mqtt would provide lightweight data transport mq in mqtt came from ibms mq series message queuing product linecitation needed fog computing is a viable alternative to prevent such large burst of data flow through internet101 the edge devices computation power can be used to analyse and process data thus providing easy real time scalabilitycitation needed complexityedit in semiopen or closed loops ie value chains whenever a global finality can be settled iot will often be considered and studied as a complex system102 due to the huge number of different links interactions between autonomous actors and its capacity to integrate new actors at the overall stage full open loop it will likely be seen as a chaotic environment since systems always have finality as a practical approach not all elements in the internet of things run in a global public space subsystems are often implemented to mitigate the risks of privacy control and reliability for example domestic robotics domotics running inside a smart home might only share data within and be available via a local networkcitation needed size considerationsedit the internet of things would encode 50 to 100 trillion objects and be able to follow the movement of those objects human beings in surveyed urban environments are each surrounded by 1000 to 5000 trackable objects103 space considerationsedit in the internet of things the precise geographic location of a thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical104 therefore facts about a thing such as its location in time and space have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can decide whether or not that information was important to the action being taken and if so add the missing information or decide to not take the action note that some things in the internet of things will be sensors and sensor location is usually important105 the geoweb and digital earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location however the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales the need to handle massive amounts of data and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations in the internet of things if things are able to take actions on their own initiative this humancentric mediation role is eliminated thus the timespace context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem just as standards play a key role in the internet and the web geospatial standards will play a key role in the internet of thingscitation needed a solution to basket of remotesedit many iot devices have a potential to take a piece of this market jeanlouis gassée apple initial alumni team and beos cofounder has addressed this topic in an article on monday note106 where he predicts that the most likely problem will be what he calls the basket of remotes problem where well have hundreds of applications to interface with hundreds of devices that dont share protocols for speaking with one anothercitation needed there are multiple approaches to solve this problem one of them called the predictive interaction107 where cloud or fog based decision makersclarification needed will predict the users next action and trigger some reactioncitation needed for user interaction new technology leaders are joining forces to create standards for communication between devices manufacturers are becoming more conscious of this problem and many companies have begun releasing their devices with open apis many of these apis are used by smaller companies looking to take advantage of quick integrationcitation needed frameworksedit iot frameworks might help support the interaction between things and allow for more complex structures like distributed computing and the development of distributed applications currently some iot frameworks seem to focus on realtime data logging solutions offering some basis to work with many things and have them interact future developments might lead to specific softwaredevelopment environments to create the software to work with the hardware used in the internet of things companies are developing technology platforms to provide this type of functionality for the internet of things newer platforms are being developed which add more intelligence rest is a scalable architecture that allows things to communicate over hypertext transfer protocol and is easily adopted for iot applications to provide communication from a thing to a central web servercitation needed standards and standards organizationsedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it september 2016 this is a list of technical standards for the iot most of which are open standards and the standards organizations that aspire to successfully setting themcitation needed short name long name standards under development other notes autoid labs — networked rfid radiofrequency identification and

standards foundation protocol extensions of xmpp extensible messaging and presence protocol the open standard of instant messaging enabling technologies for iotedit there are many technologies that enable iot crucial to the field is the network used to communicate between devices of an iot installation a role that several wireless or wired technologies may fulfill108109110111 addressabilityedit the original idea of the autoid center is based on rfidtags and unique identification through the electronic product code however this has evolved into objects having an ip address or uricitation needed an alternative view from the world of the semantic web112 focuses instead on making all things not just those electronic smart or rfidenabled addressable by the existing naming protocols such as uri the objects themselves do not converse but they may now be referred to by other agents such as powerful centralized servers acting for their human ownerscitation neededintegration with the internet implies that devices will use an ip address as a unique identifier due to the limited address space of ipv4 which allows for 43 billion unique addresses objects in the iot will have to use the next generation of the internet protocol ipv6 to scale to the extremely large address space required113114115 internetofthings devices additionally will benefit from the stateless address autoconfiguration present in ipv6116 as it reduces the configuration overhead on the hosts114 and the ietf 6lowpan header compression to a large extent the future of the internet of things will not be possible without the support of ipv6 and consequently the global adoption of ipv6 in the coming years will be critical for the successful development of the iot in the future115 shortrange

the network network simulators like opnet netsim and ns2 can be used to simulate iot networkscitation needed digital twins may also be implemented to produce updates on the status and health of an asset based upon sensor readings integrated with a computational model of the asset117 politics and civic engagementedit some scholars and activists argue that the iot can be used to create new models of civic engagement if device networks can be open to user control and interoperable platforms philip n howard a professor and author writes that political life in both democracies and authoritarian regimes will be shaped by the way the iot will be used for civic engagement for that to happen he argues that any connected device should be able to divulge a list of the ultimate beneficiaries of its sensor data and that individual citizens should be able to add new organizations to the beneficiary list in addition he argues that civil society groups need to start developing their iot strategy for making use of data and engaging with the public118 government regulation on iotedit one of the key drivers of the iot is data the success of the idea of connecting devices to make them more efficient is dependent upon access to and storage processing of data for this purpose companies working on iot collect data from multiple sources and store it in their cloud network for further processing this leaves the door wide open for privacy and security dangers and single point vulnerability of multiple systems119 the other issues pertain to consumer choice and ownership of data120 and how it is used presently the regulators have shown more interest in protecting the first three issues identified abovecitation needed current regulatory environment a report published by the federal trade commission ftc in january 2015 made the following three recommendations121 data security – at the time of designing iot companies should ensure that data collection storage and processing would be secure at all times companies should adopt a “defence in depth” approach and encrypt data at each stage122 data consent – users should have a choice as to what data they share with iot companies and the users must be informed if their data gets exposed data minimization – iot companies should collect only the data they need and retain the collected information only for a limited time however the ftc stopped at just making recommendations for now according to an ftc analysis the existing framework consisting of the ftc act the fair credit reporting act and the children’s online privacy protection act along with developing consumer education and business guidance participation in multistakeholder efforts and advocacy to other agencies at the federal state and local level is sufficient to protect consumer rights123 a resolution passed by the senate in march 2015 is already being considered by the congress124 this resolution recognized the need for formulating a national policy on iot and the matter of privacy security and spectrum furthermore to provide an impetus to the iot ecosystem in march 2016 a bipartisan group of four senators proposed a bill the developing innovation and growing the internet of things digit act to direct the federal communications commission to assess the need for more spectrum to connect iot devices several standards for the iot industry are actually being established relating to automobiles because most concerns arising from use of connected cars apply to healthcare devices as well in fact the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa is preparing cybersecurity guidelines and a database of best practices to make automotive computer systems more secure125 criticism and controversiesedit platform fragmentationedit iot suffers from platform fragmentation and lack of technical standards126127128129130131132 a situation where the variety of iot devices in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them makes the task of developing applications that work consistently between different inconsistent technology ecosystems hard1 customers may be hesitant to bet their iot future on a proprietary software or hardware devices that uses proprietary protocols that may fade or become difficult to customize and interconnect2 iots amorphous computing nature is also a problem for security since patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lowerprice devices133134135 one set of researchers say that the failure of vendors to support older devices with patches and updates leaves more than 87 of active devices vulnerable136137 privacy autonomy and controledit philip n howard a professor and author writes that the internet of things offers immense potential for empowering citizens making government transparent and broadening information access howard cautions however that privacy threats are enormous as is the potential for social control and political manipulation138 concerns about privacy have led many to consider the possibility that big data infrastructures such as the internet of things and data mining are inherently incompatible with privacy139 writer adam greenfield claims that these technologies are not only an invasion of public space but are also being used to perpetuate normative behavior citing an instance of billboards with hidden cameras that tracked the demographics of passersby who stopped to read the advertisement140 the internet of things council compared the increased prevalence of digital surveillance due to the internet of things to the conceptual panopticon described by jeremy bentham in the 18th century141 the assertion was defended by the works of french philosophers michel foucault and gilles deleuze in discipline and punish the birth of the prison foucault asserts that the panopticon was a central element of the discipline society developed during the industrial era142 foucault also argued that the discipline systems established in factories and school reflected benthams vision of panopticism142 in his 1992 paper postscripts on the societies of control deleuze wrote that the discipline society had transitioned into a control society with the computer replacing the panopticon as an instrument of discipline and control while still maintaining the qualities similar to that of panopticism143 the privacy of households could be compromised by solely analyzing smart home network traffic patterns without dissecting the contents of encrypted application data yet a synthetic packet injection scheme can be used to safely overcome such invasion of privacy144 peterpaul verbeek a professor of philosophy of technology at the university of twente netherlands writes that technology already influences our moral decision making which in turn affects human agency privacy and autonomy he cautions against viewing technology merely as a human tool and advocates instead to consider it as an active agent145 justin brookman of the center for democracy and technology expressed concern regarding the impact of iot on consumer privacy saying that there are some people in the commercial space who say oh big data — well lets collect everything keep it around forever well pay for somebody to think about security later the question is whether we want to have some sort of policy framework in place to limit that146 tim oreilly believes that the way companies sell the iot devices on consumers are misplaced disputing the notion that the iot is about gaining efficiency from putting all kinds of devices online and postulating that iot is really about human augmentation the applications are profoundly different when you have sensors and data driving the decisionmaking147 editorials at wired have also expressed concern one stating what youre about to lose is your privacy actually its worse than that you arent just going to lose your privacy youre going to have to watch the very concept of privacy be rewritten under your nose148 the american civil liberties union aclu expressed concern regarding the ability of iot to erode peoples control over their own lives the aclu wrote that theres simply no way to forecast how these immense powers – disproportionately accumulating in the hands of corporations seeking financial advantage and governments craving ever more control – will be used chances are big data and the internet of things will make it harder for us to control our own lives as we grow increasingly transparent to powerful corporations and government institutions that are becoming more opaque to us149 in response to rising concerns about privacy and smart technology in 2007 the british government stated it would follow formal privacy by design principles when implementing their smart metering program the program would lead to replacement of traditional power meters with smart power meters which could track and manage energy usage more accurately150 however the british computer society is doubtful these principles were ever actually implemented151 in 2009 the dutch parliament rejected a similar smart metering program basing their decision on privacy concerns the dutch program later revised and passed in 2011151 data storage and analyticsedit a challenge for producers of iot applications is to clean process and interpret the vast amount of data which is gathered by the sensors there is a solution proposed for the analytics of the information referred to as wireless sensor networks152 these networks share data among sensor nodes that are send to a distributed system for the analytics of the sensory datacitation needed another challenge is the storage of this bulk data depending on the application there could be high data acquisition requirements which in turn lead to high storage requirements currently the internet is already responsible for 5 of the total energy generated152 and this consumption will increase significantly when we start utilizing applications with multiple embedded sensorscitation needed securityedit concerns have been raised that the internet of things is being developed rapidly without appropriate consideration of the profound security challenges involved153 and the regulatory changes that might be necessary154155 most of the technical security issues are similar to those of conventional servers workstations and smartphones but the firewall security update and antimalware systems used for those are generally unsuitable for the much smaller less capable iot devicescitation needed according to the business insider intelligence survey conducted in the last quarter of 2014 39 of the respondents said that security is the biggest concern in adopting internet of things technology156 in particular as the internet of things spreads widely cyber attacks are likely to become an increasingly physical rather than simply virtual threat157 in a january 2014 article in forbes cybersecurity columnist joseph steinberg listed many internetconnected appliances that can already spy on people in their own homes including televisions kitchen appliances158 cameras and thermostats159 computercontrolled devices in automobiles such as brakes engine locks hood and trunk releases horn heat and dashboard have been shown to be vulnerable to attackers who have access to the onboard network in some cases vehicle computer systems are internetconnected allowing them to be exploited remotely160 by 2008 security researchers had shown the ability to remotely control pacemakers without authority later hackers demonstrated remote control of insulin pumps161 and implantable cardioverter defibrillators162 david pogue wrote163 that some recently published reports about hackers remotely controlling certain functions of automobiles were not as serious as one might otherwise guess because of various mitigating circumstances such as the bug that allowed the hack having been fixed before the report was published or that the hack required security researchers having physical access to the car prior to the hack to prepare for itcitation needed the us national intelligence council in an unclassified report maintains that it would be hard to deny access to networks of sensors and remotelycontrolled objects by enemies of the united states criminals and mischief makers an open market for aggregated sensor data could serve the interests of commerce and security no less than it helps criminals and spies identify vulnerable targets thus massively parallel sensor fusion may undermine social cohesion if it proves to be fundamentally incompatible with fourthamendment guarantees against unreasonable search164 in general the intelligence community views the internet of things as a rich source of data165 as a response to increasing concerns over security the internet of things security foundation iotsf was launched on 23 september 2015 iotsf has a mission to secure the internet of things by promoting knowledge and best practice its founding board is made from technology providers and telecommunications companies including bt vodafone imagination technologies and pen test partners in addition large it companies are continuously developing innovative solutions to ensure the security for iot devices as per the estimates from kbv research166 the overall iot security market167 would grow at 279 rate during 2016–2022 as a result of growing infrastructural concerns and diversified usage of internet of things168169 in 2016 a distributed denial of service attack powered by internet of things devices running the mirai malware took down a dns provider and major web sites170 security experts view internet of things as a threat to the traditional internet171 some argue that market incentive to secure iot devices is insufficient and increased governmental regulation is necessary to make the internet of things secure172 the overall understanding of iot is essential for basic user security keeping up with current anti virus software and patching updates will help mitigate cyber attacks designedit given widespread recognition of the evolving nature of the design and management of the internet of things sustainable and secure deployment of iot solutions must design for anarchic scalability173 application of the concept of anarchic scalability can be extended to physical systems ie controlled realworld objects by virtue of those systems being designed to account for uncertain management futures this hard anarchic scalability thus provides a pathway forward to fully realize the potential of internetofthings solutions by selectively constraining physical systems to allow for all management regimes without risking physical failurecitation needed brown university computer scientist michael littman has argued that successful execution of the internet of things requires consideration of the interfaces usability as well as the technology itself these interfaces need to be not only more userfriendly but also better integrated if users need to learn different interfaces for their vacuums their locks their sprinklers their lights and their coffeemakers its tough to say that their lives have been made any easier174 environmental sustainability impactedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed november 2015 learn how and when to remove this template message a concern regarding internetofthings technologies pertains to the environmental impacts of the manufacture use and eventual disposal of all these semiconductorrich devices175 modern electronics are replete with a wide variety of heavy metals and rareearth metals as well as highly toxic synthetic chemicals this makes them extremely difficult to properly recycle electronic components are often incinerated or placed in regular landfills furthermore the human and environmental cost of mining the rareearth metals that are integral to modern electronic components continues to grow with production of electronic equipment growing globally yet little of the metals from endoflife equipment are being recovered for reuse the environmental impacts can be expected to increasecitation needed also because the concept of internet of things entails adding electronics to mundane devices for example simple light switches and because the major driver for replacement of electronic components is often technological obsolescence rather than actual failure to function it is reasonable to expect that items that previously were kept in service for many decades would see an accelerated replacement cycle if they were part of the iot for example a traditional house built with 30 light switches and 30 electrical outlets might stand for 50 years with all those components still original at the end of that period but a modern house built with the same number of switches and outlets set up for iot might see each switch and outlet replaced at fiveyear intervals in order to keep up to date with technological changes this translates into a tenfold increase in waste requiring disposalcitation needed intentional obsolescence of devicesedit the electronic frontier foundation has raised concerns that companies can use the technologies necessary to support connected devices to intentionally disable or brick their customers devices via a remote software update or by disabling a service necessary to the operation of the device in one example home automation devices sold with the promise of a lifetime subscription were rendered useless after nest labs acquired revolv and made the decision to shut down the central servers the revolv devices had used to operate176 as nest is a company owned by alphabet googles parent company the eff argues this sets a terrible precedent for a company with ambitions to sell selfdriving cars medical devices and other highend gadgets that may be essential to a persons livelihood or physical safety177 owners should be free to point their devices to a different server or collaborate on improved software but such action violates the united states dmca section 1201 which only has an exemption for local use this forces tinkerers who want to keep using their own equipment into a legal grey area eff thinks buyers should refuse electronics and software that prioritize the manufacturers wishes above their own177 examples of postsale manipulations include google nest revolv disabled privacy settings on android sony disabling linux on playstation 3 enforced eula on wii u177 confusing terminologyedit kevin lonergan at information age a businesstechnology magazine has referred to the terms surrounding iot as a “terminology zoo”178 the lack of clear terminology is not “useful from a practical point of view” and a “source of confusion for the end user”178 a company operating in the iot space could be working in anything related to sensor technology networking embedded systems or analytics178 according to lonergan the term iot was coined before smart phones tablets and devices as we know them today existed and there is a long list of terms with varying degrees of overlap and technological convergence internet of things internet of everything ioe industrial internet pervasive computing pervasive sensing ubiquitous computing cyberphysical systems cps wireless sensor networks wsn smart objects cooperating objects machine to machine m2m ambient intelligence ami operational technology ot and information technology it178 regarding iiot an industrial subfield of iot the industrial internet consortiums vocabulary task group has created a common and reusable vocabulary of terms179 to ensure consistent terminology179180 across publications issued by the industrial internet consortium iot one has created an iot terms database including a new term alert181 to be notified when a new term is published as of march 2017 this database aggregates 711 iotrelated terms182 however without any attempts to reduce terminological ambiguity and complexitycitation needed iot adoption barriersedit ge digital ceo william ruh speaking about ges attempts to gain a foothold in the market for iot services at the first ieee computer society techignite conference lack of interoperability and unclear value propositionsedit despite a shared belief in the potential of iot industry leaders and consumers are facing barriers to adopt iot technology more widely mike farley argued in forbes that many iot solutions either lack interoperability or a clear use case for endusers183 “instead of convincing consumers that they need complex systems to serve needs they don’t have we should fix real problems people struggle with every day”183 many gadgets in the consumer iot space have appealed to early adopters yet failed to demonstrate relevance to ordinary people’s lives “in order to boost sales and drive demand beyond the early adopter set we need to stop making toys no one cares about and instead work on building simple solutions to real everyday problems for real people”183 a recent study by ericsson regarding the adoption of iot among danish companies has suggested that many are struggling “to pinpoint exactly where the value of iot lies for them”184 a company must identify where the value of iot lies in order to capture it otherwise nonaction is the consequence184 this indicates that a major roadblock to iot adoption is not technical but analytical in naturecitation needed privacy and security concernsedit according to a recent study by noura aleisa and karen renaud at the university of glasgow the internet of things potential for major privacy invasion is a concern185 with much of research disproportionally focused on the security concerns of iot185 among the proposed solutions in terms of the techniques they deployed and the extent to which they satisfied core privacy principles185 only very few turned out to be fully satisfactory louis basenese investment director at wall street daily has criticized the industrys lack of attention to security issues despite highprofile and alarming hacks device manufacturers remain undeterred focusing on profitability over security consumers need to have ultimate control over collected data including the option to delete it if they choosewithout privacy assurances widescale consumer adoption simply wont happen186 in a postsnowden world of global surveillance disclosures consumers take a more active interest in protecting their privacy and demand iot devices to be screened for potential security vulnerabilities and privacy violations before purchasing them according to the 2016 accenture digital consumer survey in which 28000 consumers in 28 countries were polled on their use of consumer technology security “has moved from being a nagging problem to a top barrier as consumers are now choosing to abandon iot devices and services over security concerns”187 the survey revealed that “out of the consumers aware of hacker attacks and owning or planning to own iot devices in the next five years 18 percent decided to terminate the use of the services and related services until they get safety guarantees”187 this suggests that consumers increasingly perceive privacy risks and security concerns to outweigh the value propositions of iot devices and opt to postpone planned purchases or service subscriptions187 traditional governance structuresedit a study issued by ericsson regarding the adoption of internet of things among danish companies identified a clash between iot and companies traditional governance structures as iot still presents both uncertainties and a lack of historical precedence184 among the respondents interviewed 60 percent stated that they do not believe they have the organizational capabilities and three of four do not believe they have the processes needed to capture the iot opportunity184 this has led to a need to understand organizational culture in order to facilitate organizational design processes and to test new innovation management practices a lack of digital leadership in the age of digital transformation has also stifled innovation and iot adoption to a degree that many companies in the face of uncertainty were waiting for the market dynamics to play out184 or further action in regards to iot was pending competitor moves customer pull or regulatory requirements184 some of these companies risk being kodaked – kodak was a market leader until digital disruption eclipsed film photography with digital photos188 – failing to see the disruptive forces affecting their industry189 and to truly embrace the new business models the disruptive change opens up189 scott anthony has written in harvard business review that kodak created a digital camera invested in the technology and even understood that photos would be shared online189 but ultimately failed to realize that online photo sharing was the new business not just a way to expand the printing business189 see alsoedit home automation web of things smart grid algorithmic regulation cyberphysical system cloud manufacturing data distribution service device ecology mcu
