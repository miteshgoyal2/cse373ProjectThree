conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv91011 following initial infection a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience a brief period of influenzalike illness5 typically this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms6 as the infection progresses it interferes more with the immune system increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis as well as other opportunistic infections and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems5 these late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids6 this stage is often also associated with weight loss6 hiv is spread primarily by unprotected sex including anal and oral sex contaminated blood transfusions hypodermic needles and from mother to child during pregnancy delivery or breastfeeding12 some bodily fluids such as saliva and tears do not transmit hiv13 methods of prevention include safe sex needle exchange programs treating those who are infected and male circumcision5 disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication5 there is no cure or vaccine however antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a nearnormal life expectancy67 treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made14 without treatment the average survival time after infection is 11 years15 in 2016 about 367 million people were living with hiv and it resulted in 1 million deaths16 there were 300000 fewer new hiv cases in 2016 than in 201517 most of those infected live in subsaharan africa5 between its discovery and 2014 aids has caused an estimated 39 million deaths worldwide18 hivaids is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading19 hiv is believed to have originated in westcentral africa during the late 19th or early 20th century20 aids was first recognized by the united states centers for disease control and prevention cdc in 1981 and its cause—hiv infection—was identified in the early part of the decade21 hivaids has had a great impact on society both as an illness and as a source of discrimination22 the disease also has large economic impacts22 there are many misconceptions about hivaids such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual nonsexual contact23 the disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion including the catholic churchs position not to support condom use as prevention24 it has attracted international medical and political attention as well as largescale funding since it was identified in the 1980s25 play media video explanation contents 1 signs and symptoms 11 acute infection 12 clinical latency

reading 15 external links signs and symptoms main article signs and symptoms of hivaids there are three main stages of hiv infection acute infection clinical latency and aids1 acute infection main symptoms of acute hiv infection the initial period following the contraction of hiv is called acute hiv primary hiv or acute retroviral syndrome226 many individuals develop an influenzalike illness or a mononucleosislike illness 2–4 weeks post exposure while others have no significant symptoms2728 symptoms occur in 40–90 of cases and most commonly include fever large tender lymph nodes throat inflammation a rash headache andor sores of the mouth and genitals2628 the rash which occurs in 20–50 of cases presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular classically29 some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage26 gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur28 neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or guillain–barré syndrome also occurs28 the duration of the symptoms varies but is usually one or two weeks28 due to their nonspecific character these symptoms are not often recognized as signs of hiv infection even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed as one of the many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms thus it is recommended that hiv be considered in people presenting an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection28 clinical latency the initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency asymptomatic hiv or chronic hiv1 without treatment this second stage of the natural history of hiv infection can last from about three years30 to over 20 years31 on average about eight years32 while typically there are few or no symptoms at first near the end of this stage many people experience fever weight loss gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains1 between 50 and 70 of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy characterized by unexplained nonpainful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes other than in the groin for over three to six months2 although most hiv1 infected individuals have a detectable viral load and in the absence of treatment will eventually progress to aids a small proportion about 5 retain high levels of cd4 t cells t helper cells without antiretroviral therapy for more than 5 years2833 these individuals are classified as hiv controllers or longterm nonprogressors ltnp33 another group consists of those who maintain a low or undetectable viral load without antiretroviral treatment known as elite controllers or elite suppressors they represent approximately 1 in 300 infected persons34 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome main symptoms of aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids is defined in terms of either a cd4 t cell count below 200 cells per µl or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an hiv infection28 in the absence of specific treatment around half of people infected with hiv develop aids within ten years28 the most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of aids are pneumocystis pneumonia 40 cachexia in the form of hiv wasting syndrome 20 and esophageal candidiasis28 other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections28 opportunistic infections may be caused by bacteria viruses fungi and parasites that are normally controlled by the immune system35 which infections occur depends partly on what organisms are common in the persons environment28 these infections may affect nearly every organ system36 people with aids have an increased risk of developing various viralinduced cancers including kaposis sarcoma burkitts lymphoma primary central nervous system lymphoma and cervical cancer29 kaposis sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20 of people with hiv37 the second most common cancer is lymphoma which is the cause of death of nearly 16 of people with aids and is the initial sign of aids in 3 to 437 both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 837 cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with aids because of its association with human papillomavirus hpv37 conjunctival cancer of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye is also more common in those with hiv38 additionally people with aids frequently have systemic symptoms such as prolonged fevers sweats particularly at night swollen lymph nodes chills weakness and unintended weight loss39 diarrhea is another common symptom present in about 90 of people with aids40 they can also be affected by diverse psychiatric and neurological symptoms independent of opportunistic infections and cancers41 transmission average per act risk of getting hiv by exposure route to an infected source exposure route chance of infection blood transfusion 9042 childbirth to child 2543 needlesharing injection drug use 06742 percutaneous needle stick 03044 receptive anal

intercourse§ 0–000548 assuming no condom use § source refers to oral intercourse performed on a man hiv is transmitted by three main routes sexual contact significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues and from mother to child during pregnancy delivery or breastfeeding known as vertical transmission12 there is no risk of acquiring hiv if exposed to feces nasal secretions saliva sputum sweat tears urine or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood49 it is possible to be coinfected by more than one strain of hiv—a condition known as hiv superinfection50 sexual the most frequent mode of transmission of hiv is through sexual contact with an infected person12 globally the most common mode of hiv transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex12 however the pattern of transmission varies among countries as of 2014 most hiv transmission in the united states occurred among men who had sex with men 83 of new hiv diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67 of total new diagnoses51 in the us gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92 of new hiv diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27 of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men51 about 15 of gay and bisexual men have hiv while 28 percent of transgender women test positive in the us5152 with regard to unprotected heterosexual contacts estimates of the risk of hiv transmission per sexual act appear to be four to ten times higher in lowincome countries than in highincome countries53 in lowincome countries the risk of femaletomale transmission is estimated as 038 per act and of maletofemale transmission as 030 per act the equivalent estimates for highincome countries are 004 per act for femaletomale transmission and 008 per act for maletofemale transmission53 the risk of transmission from anal intercourse is especially high estimated as 14–17 per act in both heterosexual and homosexual contacts5354 while the risk of transmission from oral sex is relatively low it is still present55 the risk from receiving oral sex has been described as nearly nil56 however a few cases have been reported57 the peract risk is estimated at 0–004 for receptive oral intercourse58 in settings involving prostitution in low income countries risk of femaletomale transmission has been estimated as 24 per act and maletofemale transmission as 005 per act53 risk of transmission increases in the presence of many sexually transmitted infections59 and genital ulcers53 genital ulcers appear to increase the risk approximately fivefold53 other sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea chlamydia trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis are associated with somewhat smaller increases in risk of transmission58 the viral load of an infected person is an important risk factor in both sexual and mothertochild transmission60 during the first 25 months of an hiv infection a persons infectiousness is twelve times higher due to this high viral load58 if the person is in the late stages of infection rates of transmission are approximately eightfold greater53 commercial sex workers including those in pornography have an increased rate of hiv6162 rough sex can be a factor associated with an increased risk of transmission63 sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of hiv transmission as condoms are rarely worn physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections64 body fluids cdc poster from 1989 highlighting the threat of aids associated with drug use the second most frequent mode of hiv transmission is via blood and blood products12 bloodborne transmission can be through needlesharing during intravenous drug use needle stick injury transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product or medical injections with unsterilized equipment the risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 063 and 24 per act with an average of 0865 the risk of acquiring hiv from a needle stick from an hivinfected person is estimated as 03 about 1 in 333 per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 009 about 1 in 1000 per act49 in the united states intravenous drug users made up 12 of all new cases of hiv in 200966 and in some areas more than 80 of people who inject drugs are hiv positive12 hiv is transmitted in about 93 of blood transfusions using infected blood65 in developed countries the risk of acquiring hiv from a blood transfusion is extremely low less than one in half a million where improved donor selection and hiv screening is performed12 for example in the uk the risk is reported at one in five million67 and in the united states it was one in 15 million in 200868 in low income countries only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened as of 200869 and it is estimated that up to 15 of hiv infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products representing between 5 and 10 of global infections1270 although rare because of screening it is possible to acquire hiv from organ and tissue transplantation71 unsafe medical injections play a significant role in hiv spread in subsaharan africa in 2007 between 12 and 17 of infections in this region were attributed to medical syringe use72 the world health organization estimates the risk of transmission as a result of a medical injection in africa at 1272 significant risks are also associated with invasive procedures assisted delivery and dental care in this area of the world72 people giving or receiving tattoos piercings and scarification are theoretically at risk of infection but no confirmed cases have been documented73 it is not possible for mosquitoes or other insects to transmit hiv74 mothertochild main articles hiv and pregnancy and hiv and breastfeeding hiv can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy during delivery or through breast milk resulting in the baby also contracting hiv7576 this is the third most common way in which hiv is transmitted globally12 in the absence of treatment the risk of transmission before or during birth is around 20 and in those who also breastfeed 3575 as of 2008 vertical transmission accounted for about 90 of cases of hiv in children75 with appropriate treatment the risk of mothertochild infection can be reduced to about 175 preventive treatment involves the mother taking antiretrovirals during pregnancy and delivery an elective caesarean section avoiding breastfeeding and administering antiretroviral drugs to the newborn77 antiretrovirals when taken by either the mother or the infant decrease the risk of transmission in those who do breastfeed78 however many of these measures are not available in the developing world77 if blood contaminates food during prechewing it may pose a risk of transmission73 if a woman is untreated two years of breastfeeding results in an hivaids risk in her baby of about 17 treatment decreases this risk to 1 to 2 per year due to the increased risk of death without breastfeeding in many areas in the developing world the world health organization recommends either 1 the mother and baby being treated with antiretroviral medication while breastfeeding being continued 2 the provision of safe formula79 virology main article hiv diagram of a hiv virion structure scanning electron micrograph of hiv1 colored green budding from a cultured lymphocyte hiv is the cause of the spectrum of disease known as hivaids hiv is a retrovirus that primarily infects components of the human immune system such as cd4 t cells macrophages and dendritic cells it directly and indirectly destroys cd4 t cells80 hiv is a member of the genus lentivirus81 part of the family retroviridae82 lentiviruses share many morphological and biological characteristics many species of mammals are infected by lentiviruses which are characteristically responsible for longduration illnesses with a long incubation period83 lentiviruses are transmitted as singlestranded positivesense enveloped rna viruses upon entry into the target cell the viral rna genome is converted reverse transcribed into doublestranded dna by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle the resulting viral dna is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular dna by a virally encoded integrase and host cofactors84 once integrated the virus may become latent allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system85 alternatively the virus may be transcribed producing new rna genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew86 hiv is now known to spread between cd4 t cells by two parallel routes cellfree spread and celltocell spread ie it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms87 in the cellfree spread virus particles bud from an infected t cell enter the bloodextracellular fluid and then infect another t cell following a chance encounter87 hiv can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of celltocell spread8889 the hybrid spreading mechanisms of hiv contribute to the viruss ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies8790 two types of hiv have been characterized hiv1 and hiv2 hiv1 is the virus that was originally discovered and initially referred to also as lav or htlviii it is more virulent more infective91 and is the cause of the majority of hiv infections globally the lower infectivity of hiv2 as compared with hiv1 implies that fewer people exposed to hiv2 will be infected per exposure because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission hiv2 is largely confined to west africa92 pathophysiology main article pathophysiology of hivaids play media hivaids explained in a simple way hiv replication cycle after the virus enters the body there is a period of rapid viral replication leading to an abundance of virus in the peripheral blood during primary infection the level of hiv may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood93 this response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating cd4 t cells the acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of cd8 t cells which kill hivinfected cells and subsequently with antibody production or seroconversion the cd8 t cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels which peak and then decline as the cd4 t cell counts recover a good cd8 t cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis though it does not eliminate the virus94 ultimately hiv causes aids by depleting cd4 t cells this weakens the immune system and allows opportunistic infections t cells are essential to the immune response and without them the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells the mechanism of cd4 t cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases95 during the acute phase hivinduced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by cytotoxic t cells accounts for cd4 t cell depletion although apoptosis may also be a factor during the chronic phase the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of the immune system to generate new t cells appear to account for the slow decline in cd4 t cell numbers96 although the symptoms of immune deficiency characteristic of aids do not appear for years after a person is infected the bulk of cd4 t cell loss occurs during the first weeks of infection especially in the intestinal mucosa which harbors the majority of the lymphocytes found in the body97 the reason for the preferential loss of mucosal cd4 t cells is that the majority of mucosal cd4 t cells express the ccr5 protein which hiv uses as a coreceptor to gain access to the cells whereas only a small fraction of cd4 t cells in the bloodstream do so98 a specific genetic change that alters the ccr5 protein when present in both chromosomes very effectively prevents hiv1 infection99 hiv seeks out and destroys ccr5 expressing cd4 t cells during acute infection100 a vigorous immune response eventually controls the infection and initiates the clinically latent phase cd4 t cells in mucosal tissues remain particularly affected100 continuous hiv replication causes a state of generalized immune activation persisting throughout the chronic phase101 immune activation which is reflected by the increased activation state of immune cells and release of proinflammatory cytokines results from the activity of several hiv gene products and the immune response to ongoing hiv replication it is also linked to the breakdown of the immune surveillance system of the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier caused by the depletion of mucosal cd4 t cells during the acute phase of disease102 diagnosis main article diagnosis of hivaids a generalized graph of the relationship between hiv copies viral load and cd4 t cell counts over the average course of untreated hiv infection   cd4 t lymphocyte count cellsmm³   hiv rna copies per ml of plasma hivaids is diagnosed via laboratory testing and then staged based on the presence of certain signs or symptoms26 hiv screening is recommended by the united states preventive services task force for all people 15 years to 65 years of age including all pregnant women103 additionally testing is recommended for those at high risk which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness29 in many areas of the world a third of hiv carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when aids or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent29 hiv testing most people infected with hiv develop specific antibodies ie seroconvert within three to twelve weeks of the initial infection28 diagnosis of primary hiv before seroconversion is done by measuring hivrna or p24 antigen28 positive results obtained by antibody or pcr testing are confirmed either by a different antibody or by pcr26 antibody tests in children younger than 18 months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies104 thus hiv infection can only be diagnosed by pcr testing for hiv rna or dna or via testing for the p24 antigen26 much of the world lacks access to reliable pcr testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing104 in subsaharan africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70 of the population were aware of their hiv status105 in 2009 between 36 and 42 of men and women in subsaharan countries were tested105 which represented a significant increase compared to previous years105 classifications two main clinical staging systems are used to classify hiv and hivrelated disease for surveillance purposes the who disease staging system for hiv infection and disease26 and the cdc classification system for hiv infection106 the cdcs classification system is more frequently adopted in developed countries since the whos staging system does not require laboratory tests it is suited to the resourcerestricted conditions encountered in developing countries where it can also be used to help guide clinical management despite their differences the two systems allow comparison for statistical purposes226106 the world health organization first proposed a definition for aids in 198626 since then the who classification has been updated and expanded several times with the most recent version being published in 200726 the who system uses the following categories primary hiv infection may be either asymptomatic or associated with acute retroviral syndrome26 stage i hiv infection is asymptomatic with a cd4 t cell count also known as cd4 count greater than 500 per microlitre µl or cubic mm of blood26 may include generalized lymph node enlargement26 stage ii mild symptoms which may include minor mucocutaneous manifestations and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections a cd4 count of less than 500µl26 stage iii advanced symptoms which may include unexplained chronic diarrhea for longer than a month severe bacterial infections including tuberculosis of the lung and a cd4 count of less than 350µl26 stage iv or aids severe symptoms which include toxoplasmosis of the brain candidiasis of the esophagus trachea bronchi or lungs and kaposis sarcoma a cd4 count of less than 200µl26 the united states center for disease control and prevention also created a classification system for hiv and updated it in 2008 and 2014106107 this system classifies hiv infections based on cd4 count and clinical symptoms and describes the infection in five groups107 in those greater than six years of age it is107 stage 0 the time between a negative or indeterminate hiv test followed less than 180 days by a positive test stage 1 cd4 count ≥ 500 cellsµl and no aids defining conditions stage 2 cd4 count 200 to 500 cellsµl and no aids defining conditions stage 3 cd4 count ≤ 200 cellsµl or aids defining conditions unknown if insufficient information is available to make any of the above classifications for surveillance purposes the aids diagnosis still stands even if after treatment the cd4 t cell count rises to above 200 per µl of blood or other aidsdefining illnesses are cured2 prevention main article prevention of hivaids aids clinic mcleod ganj himachal pradesh india 2010 sexual contact consistent condom use reduces the risk of hiv transmission by approximately 80 over the long term108 when condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected the rate of hiv infection is less than 1 per year109 there is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection110 application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir a reverse transcriptase inhibitor immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40 among african women111 by contrast use of the spermicide nonoxynol9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation112 circumcision in subsaharan africa reduces the acquisition of hiv by heterosexual men by between 38 and 66 over 24 months113 due to these studies both the world health organization and unaids recommended male circumcision as a method of preventing femaletomale hiv transmission in 2007 in areas with a high rates of hiv114 however whether it protects against maletofemale transmission is disputed115116 and whether it is of benefit in developed countries and among men who have sex with men is undetermined117118119 the international antiviral society however does recommend for all sexually active heterosexual males and that it be discussed as an option with men who have sex with men120 some experts fear that a lower perception of vulnerability among circumcised men may cause more sexual risktaking behavior thus negating its preventive effects121 programs encouraging sexual abstinence do not appear to affect subsequent hiv risk122 evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor123 comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior124 a substantial minority of young people continues to engage in highrisk practices despite knowing about hivaids underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with hiv125 voluntary counseling and testing people for hiv does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive126 it is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing hiv59 preexposure antiretroviral treatment among people with hiv whose cd4 count ≤ 550 cellsµl is a very effective way to prevent hiv infection of their partner a strategy known as treatment as prevention or tasp127 tasp is associated with a 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk127128 preexposure prophylaxis prep with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir with or without emtricitabine is effective in a number of groups including men who have sex with men couples where one is hiv positive and young heterosexuals in africa111 it may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 07 to 04 per 100 person years129 universal precautions within the health care environment are believed to be effective in decreasing the risk of hiv130 intravenous drug use is an important risk factor and harm reduction strategies such as needleexchange programs and opioid substitution therapy appear effective in decreasing this risk131132 postexposure a course of antiretrovirals administered within 48 to 72 hours after exposure to hivpositive blood or genital secretions is referred to as postexposure prophylaxis pep133 the use of the single agent zidovudine reduces the risk of a hiv infection fivefold following a needlestick injury133 as of 2013 the prevention regimen recommended in the united states consists of three medications—tenofovir emtricitabine and raltegravir—as this may reduce the risk further134 pep treatment is recommended after a sexual assault when the perpetrator is known to be hiv positive but is controversial when their hiv status is unknown135 the duration of treatment is usually four weeks136 and is frequently associated with adverse effects—where zidovudine is used about 70 of cases result in adverse effects such as nausea 24 fatigue 22 emotional distress 13 and headaches 949 mothertochild main article hiv and pregnancy programs to prevent the vertical transmission of hiv from mothers to children can reduce rates of transmission by 92–9975131 this primarily involves the use of a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding75137 if replacement feeding is acceptable feasible affordable sustainable and safe mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case138 if exclusive breastfeeding is carried out the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission139 in 2015 cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mothertochild transmission of hiv140 vaccination main article hiv vaccine currently there is no licensed vaccine for hiv or aids7 the most effective vaccine trial to date rv 144 was published in 2009 and found a partial reduction in the risk of transmission of roughly 30 stimulating some hope in the research community of developing a truly effective vaccine141 further trials of the rv 144 vaccine are ongoing142143 treatment main article management of hivaids there is currently no cure or effective hiv vaccine treatment consists of highly active antiretroviral therapy haart which slows progression of the disease144 as of 2010 more than 66 million people were taking them in low and middle income countries145 treatment also includes preventive and active treatment of opportunistic infections antiviral therapy stribild – a common oncedaily art regime consisting of elvitegravir emtricitabine tenofovir and the booster cobicistat current haart options are combinations or cocktails consisting of at least three medications belonging to at least two types or classes of antiretroviral agents146 initially treatment is typically a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nnrti plus two nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors nrtis147 typical nrtis include zidovudine azt or tenofovir tdf and lamivudine 3tc or emtricitabine ftc147 combinations of agents which include protease inhibitors pi are used if the above regimen loses effectiveness146 the world health organization and united states recommends antiretrovirals in people of all ages including pregnant women as soon as the diagnosis is made regardless of cd4 count14120148 once treatment is begun it is recommended that it is continued without breaks or holidays29 many people are diagnosed only after treatment ideally should have begun29 the desired outcome of treatment is a long term plasma hivrna count below 50 copiesml29 levels to determine if treatment is effective are initially recommended after four weeks and once levels fall below 50 copiesml checks every three to six months are typically adequate29 inadequate control is deemed to be greater than 400 copiesml29 based on these criteria treatment is effective in more than 95 of people during the first year29 benefits of treatment include a decreased risk of progression to aids and a decreased risk of death149 in the developing world treatment also improves physical and mental health150 with treatment there is a 70 reduced risk of acquiring tuberculosis146 additional benefits include a decreased risk of transmission of the disease to sexual partners and a decrease in mothertochild transmission146 the effectiveness of treatment depends to a large part on compliance29 reasons for nonadherence include poor access to medical care151 inadequate social supports mental illness and drug abuse152 the complexity of treatment regimens due to pill numbers and dosing frequency and adverse effects may reduce adherence153 even though cost is an important issue with some medications154 47 of those who needed them were taking them in low and middle income countries as of 2010145 and the rate of adherence is similar in lowincome and highincome countries155 specific adverse events are related to the antiretroviral agent taken156 some relatively common adverse events include lipodystrophy syndrome dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus especially with protease inhibitors2 other common symptoms include diarrhea156157 and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease158 newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects29 certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children29 treatment recommendations for children are somewhat different from those for adults the world health organization recommends treating all children less than 5 years of age children above 5 are treated like adults159 the united states guidelines recommend treating all children less than 12 months of age and all those with hiv rna counts greater than 100000 copiesml between one year and five years of age160 opportunistic infections measures to prevent opportunistic infections are effective in many people with hivaids in addition to improving current disease treatment with antiretrovirals reduces the risk of developing additional opportunistic infections156 adults and adolescents who are living with hiv even on antiretroviral therapy with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy ipt the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if ipt is needed161 vaccination against hepatitis a and b is advised for all people at risk of hiv before they become infected however it may also be given after infection162 trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to hiv positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings163 it is also recommended to prevent pcp when a persons cd4 count is below 200 cellsul and in those who have or have previously had pcp164 people with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and mac165 appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50 between 1992 and 1997166 influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with hivaids with some evidence of benefit167168 diet main article nutrition and hivaids the world health organization who has issued recommendations regarding nutrient requirements in hivaids169 a generally healthy diet is promoted dietary intake of micronutrients at rda levels by hivinfected adults is recommended by the who higher intake of vitamin a zinc and iron can produce adverse effects in hiv positive adults and is not recommended unless there is documented deficiency169170171172 dietary supplementation for people who are infected with hiv and who have inadequate nutrition or dietary deficiencies may strengthen their immune systems or help them recover from infections however evidence indicating an overall benefit in morbidity or reduction in mortality is not consistent173 evidence for supplementation with selenium is mixed with some tentative evidence of benefit174 for pregnant and lactating women with hiv multivitamin supplement improves outcomes for both mothers and children175 if the pregnant or lactating mother has been advised to take antiretroviral medication to prevent mothertochild hiv transmission multivitamin supplements should not replace these treatments175 there is some evidence that vitamin a supplementation in children with an hiv infection reduces mortality and improves growth176 alternative medicine in the us approximately 60 of people with hiv use various forms of complementary or alternative medicine177 even though the effectiveness of most of these therapies has not been established178 there is not enough evidence to support the use of herbal medicines179 there is insufficient evidence to recommend or support the use of medical cannabis to try to increase appetite or weight gain180 prognosis deaths due to hivaids per million

prognosis varies between people and both the cd4 count and viral load are useful for predicted outcomes28 without treatment average survival time after infection with hiv is estimated to be 9 to 11 years depending on the hiv subtype15 after the diagnosis of aids if treatment is not available survival ranges between 6 and 19 months182183 haart and appropriate prevention of opportunistic infections reduces the death rate by 80 and raises the life expectancy for a newly diagnosed young adult to 20–50 years181184185 this is between two thirds184 and nearly that of the general population29186 if treatment is started late in the infection prognosis is not as good29 for example if treatment is begun following the diagnosis of aids life expectancy is 10–40 years29181 half of

frequently the result of the progressive failure of the immune system166187 risk of cancer appears to increase once the cd4 count is below 500μl29 the rate of clinical disease progression varies widely between individuals and has been shown to be affected by a number of factors such as a persons susceptibility and immune function188 their access to health care the presence of coinfections182189 and the particular strain or strains of the virus involved190191 tuberculosis coinfection is one of the leading causes of sickness and death in those with hivaids being present in a third of all hivinfected people and causing 25 of hivrelated deaths192 hiv is also one of the most important risk factors for tuberculosis193 hepatitis c is another very common coinfection where each disease increases the progression of the other194 the two most common cancers associated with hivaids are kaposis sarcoma and aidsrelated nonhodgkins lymphoma187 other cancers that are more frequent include anal cancer burkitts lymphoma primary central nervous system lymphoma and cervical cancer29195 even with antiretroviral treatment over the long term hivinfected people may experience neurocognitive disorders196 osteoporosis197 neuropathy198 cancers199200 nephropathy201 and cardiovascular disease157 some conditions like lipodystrophy may be caused both by hiv and its treatment157 epidemiology main article epidemiology of hivaids estimated percentage of hiv among young adults 15–49 per country as of 2011202   no data   010   010–05   05–1   1–5   5–15   15–50 hivaids is a global pandemic203 as of 2016 approximately 367 million people have hiv worldwide with the number of new infections that year being about 18 million16 this is down from 31 million new infections in 2001204 slightly over half the infected population are women and 21 million are children16 it resulted in about 1 million deaths in 2016 down from a peak of 19 million in 200516 subsaharan africa is the region most affected in 2010 an estimated 68 229 million of all hiv cases and 66 of all deaths 12 million occurred in this region205 this means that about 5 of the adult population is infected206 and it is believed to be the cause of 10 of all deaths in children207 here in contrast to other regions women compose nearly 60 of cases205 south africa has the largest population of people with hiv of any country in the world at 59 million205 life expectancy has fallen in the worstaffected countries due to hivaids for example in 2006 it was estimated that it had dropped from 65 to 35 years in botswana19 mothertochild transmission as of 2013 in botswana and south africa has decreased to less than 5 with improvement in many other african nations due to improved access to antiretroviral therapy208 south south east asia is the second most affected in 2010 this region contained an estimated 4 million cases or 12 of all people living with hiv resulting in approximately 250000 deaths206 approximately 24 million of these cases are in india205 in 2008 in the united states approximately 12 million people were living with hiv resulting in about 17500 deaths the us centers for disease control and prevention estimated that in 2008 20 of infected americans were unaware of their infection209 as of 2016 about 675000 people have died hivaids in the usa since the beginning of the hiv epidemic52 in the united kingdom as of 2015 there were approximately 101200 cases which resulted in 594 deaths210 in canada as of 2008 there were about 65000 cases causing 53 deaths211 between the first recognition of aids in 1981 and 2009 it has led to nearly 30 million deaths212 prevalence is lowest in middle east and north africa at 01 or less east asia at 01 and western and central europe at 02206 the worst affected european countries in 2009 and 2012 estimates are russia ukraine latvia moldova portugal and belarus in decreasing order of prevalence213 history main article history of hivaids discovery the morbidity and mortality weekly report reported in 1981 on what was later to be called aids aids was first clinically observed in 1981 in the united states37 the initial cases were a cluster of injecting drug users and homosexual men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia pcp a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems214 soon thereafter an unexpected number of homosexual men developed a previously rare skin cancer called kaposis sarcoma ks215216 many more cases of pcp and ks emerged alerting us centers for disease control and prevention cdc and a cdc task force was formed to monitor the outbreak217 in the early days the cdc did not have an official name for the disease often referring to it by way of the diseases that were associated with it for example lymphadenopathy the disease after which the discoverers of hiv originally named the virus218219 they also used kaposis sarcoma and opportunistic infections the name by which a task force had been set up in 1981220 at one point the cdc coined the phrase the 4h disease since the syndrome seemed to affect heroin users homosexuals hemophiliacs and haitians221222 in the general press the term grid which stood for gayrelated immune deficiency had been coined223 however after determining that aids was not isolated to the gay community220 it was realized that the term grid was misleading and the term aids was introduced at a meeting in july 1982224 by september 1982 the cdc started referring to the disease as aids225 in 1983 two separate research groups led by robert gallo and luc montagnier declared that a novel retrovirus may have been infecting people with aids and published their findings in the same issue of the journal science226227 gallo claimed that a virus his group had isolated from a person with aids was strikingly similar in shape to other human tlymphotropic viruses htlvs his group had been the first to isolate gallos group called their newly isolated virus htlviii at the same time montagniers group isolated a virus from a person presenting with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck and physical weakness two characteristic symptoms of aids contradicting the report from gallos group montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of htlvi montagniers group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathyassociated virus lav217 as these two viruses turned out to be the same in 1986 lav and htlviii were renamed hiv228 origins left to right the african green monkey source of siv the sooty mangabey source of hiv2 and the chimpanzee source of hiv1 both hiv1 and hiv2 are believed to have originated in nonhuman primates in westcentral africa and were transferred to humans in the early 20th century20 hiv1 appears to have originated in southern cameroon through the evolution of sivcpz a simian immunodeficiency virus siv that infects wild chimpanzees hiv1 descends from the sivcpz endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies pan troglodytes troglodytes229230 the closest relative of hiv2 is sivsmm a virus of the sooty mangabey cercocebus atys atys an old world monkey living in coastal west africa from southern senegal to western côte divoire92 new world monkeys such as the owl monkey are resistant to hiv1 infection possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes231 hiv1 is thought to have jumped the species barrier on at least three separate occasions giving rise to the three groups of the virus m n and o232 there is evidence that humans who participate in bushmeat activities either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors commonly acquire siv233 however siv is a weak virus which is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection it is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into hiv234 furthermore due to its relatively low persontoperson transmission rate siv can only spread throughout the population in the presence of one or more highrisk transmission channels which are thought to have been absent in africa before the 20th century specific proposed highrisk transmission channels allowing the virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society depend on the proposed timing of the animaltohuman crossing genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the hiv1 m group dates back to circa 1910235 proponents of this dating link the hiv epidemic with the emergence of colonialism and growth of large colonial african cities leading to social changes including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity the spread of prostitution and the accompanying high frequency of genital ulcer diseases such as syphilis in nascent colonial cities236 while transmission rates of hiv during vaginal intercourse are low under regular circumstances they are increased many fold if one of the partners suffers from a sexually transmitted infection causing genital ulcers early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers to the degree that as of 1928 as many as 45 of female residents of eastern kinshasa were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15 of all residents of the same city had syphilis236 an alternative view holds that unsafe medical practices in africa after world war ii such as unsterile reuse of single use syringes during mass vaccination antibiotic and antimalaria treatment campaigns were the initial vector that allowed the virus to adapt to humans and spread234237238 the earliest welldocumented case of hiv in a human dates back to 1959 in the congo239 the earliest retrospectively described case of aids is believed to have been in norway beginning in 1966240 in july 1960 in the wake its independence the united nations recruited francophone experts and technicians from all over the world to assist in filling administrative gaps left by belgium who did not leave behind an african elite to run the country by 1962 haitians made up the second largest group of welleducated experts out of the 48 national groups recruited that totaled around 4500 in the country241242 dr jacques pépin a quebecer author of the origins of aids stipulates that haiti was one of hivs entry points to the united states and that one of them may have carried hiv back across the atlantic in the 1960s242 although the virus may have been present in the united states as early as 1966243 the vast majority of infections occurring outside subsaharan africa including the us can be traced back to a single unknown individual who became infected with hiv in haiti and then brought the infection to the united states some time around 1969244 the epidemic then rapidly spread among highrisk groups initially sexually promiscuous men who have sex with men by 1978 the prevalence of hiv1 among homosexual male residents of new york city and san francisco was estimated at 5 suggesting that several thousand individuals in the country had been infected244 society and culture stigma main article discrimination against people with hivaids ryan white became a poster child for hiv after being expelled from school because he was infected245 aids stigma exists around the world in a variety of ways including ostracism rejection discrimination and avoidance of hiv infected people compulsory hiv testing without prior consent or protection of confidentiality violence against hiv infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with hiv and the quarantine of hiv infected individuals22 stigmarelated violence or the fear of violence prevents many people from seeking hiv testing returning for their results or securing treatment possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating the spread of hiv246 aids stigma has been further divided into the following three categories instrumental aids stigma—a reflection of the fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness247 symbolic aids stigma—the use of hivaids to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease247 courtesy aids stigma—stigmatization of people connected to the issue of hivaids or hivpositive people248 often aids stigma is expressed in conjunction with one or more other stigmas particularly those associated with homosexuality bisexuality promiscuity prostitution and intravenous drug use249 in many developed countries there is an association between aids and homosexuality or bisexuality and this association is correlated with higher levels of sexual prejudice such as antihomosexualbisexual attitudes250 there is also a perceived association between aids and all malemale sexual behavior including sex between uninfected men247 however the dominant mode of spread worldwide for hiv remains heterosexual transmission251 in 2003 as part of an overall reform of marriage and population legislation it became legal for people with aids to marry in china252 economic impact main articles economic impact of hivaids and cost of hiv treatment changes in life expectancy in some african countries 1960–2012 hivaids affects the economics of both individuals and countries207 the gross domestic product of the most affected countries has decreased due to the lack of human capital207253 without proper nutrition health care and medicine large numbers of people die from aidsrelated complications they will not only be unable to work but will also require significant medical care it is estimated that as of 2007 there were 12 million aids orphans207 many are cared for by elderly grandparents254 returning to work after beginning treatment for hivaids is difficult and affected people often work less than the average worker unemployment in people with hivaids also is associated with suicidal ideation memory problems and social isolation employment increases selfesteem sense of dignity confidence and quality of life a 2015 cochrane review found lowquality evidence that antiretroviral treatment helps people with hivaids work more and increases the chance that a person with hivaids will be employed255 by affecting mainly young adults aids reduces the taxable population in turn reducing the resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to aids resulting in increasing pressure for the states finances and slower growth of the economy this causes a slower growth of the tax base an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick training to replace sick workers sick pay and caring for aids orphans this is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans254 at the household level aids causes both loss of income and increased spending on healthcare a study in côte divoire showed that households having a person with hivaids spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households this additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment256 religion and aids main article religion and hivaids the topic of religion and aids has become highly controversial in the past twenty years primarily because some religious authorities have publicly declared their opposition to the use of condoms257258 the religious approach to prevent the spread of aids according to a report by american health expert matthew hanley titled the catholic church and the global aids crisis argues that cultural changes are needed including a reemphasis on fidelity within marriage and sexual abstinence outside of it258 some religious organizations have claimed that prayer can cure hivaids in 2011 the bbc reported that some churches in london were claiming that prayer would cure aids and the hackneybased centre for the study of sexual health and hiv reported that several people stopped taking their medication sometimes on the direct advice of their pastor leading to a number of deaths259 the synagogue church of all nations advertise an anointing water to promote gods healing although the group deny advising people to stop taking medication259 media portrayal main article media portrayal of hivaids one of the first highprofile cases of aids was the american rock hudson a gay actor who had been married and divorced earlier in life who died on october 2 1985 having announced that he was suffering from the virus on july 25 that year he had been diagnosed during 1984260 a notable british casualty of aids that year was nicholas eden a gay politician and son of the late prime minister anthony eden261 on november 24 1991 the virus claimed the life of british rock star freddie mercury lead singer of the band queen who died from an aidsrelated illness having only revealed the diagnosis on the previous day262 however he had been diagnosed as hiv positive in 1987263 one of the first highprofile heterosexual cases of the virus was arthur ashe the american tennis player he was diagnosed as hiv positive on august 31 1988 having contracted the virus from blood transfusions during heart surgery earlier in the 1980s further tests within 24 hours of the initial diagnosis revealed that ashe had aids but he did not tell the public about his diagnosis until april 1992264 he died as a result on february 6 1993 at age 49265 therese frares photograph of gay activist david kirby as he lay dying from aids while surrounded by family was taken in april 1990 life magazine said the photo became the one image most powerfully identified with the hivaids epidemic the photo was displayed in life magazine was the winner of the world press photo and acquired worldwide notoriety after being used in a united colors of benetton advertising campaign in 1992266 in 1996 johnson aziga a ugandanborn canadian was diagnosed with hiv but subsequently had unprotected sex with 11 women without disclosing his diagnosis by 2003 seven had contracted hiv and two died from complications related to aids267268 aziga was convicted of firstdegree murder and is liable to a life sentence269 criminal transmission main article criminal transmission of hiv criminal transmission of hiv is the intentional or reckless infection of a person with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv some countries or jurisdictions including some areas of the united states have laws that criminalize hiv transmission or exposure270 others may charge the accused under laws enacted before the hiv pandemic misconceptions main articles misconceptions about hivaids and discredited hivaids origins theories there are many misconceptions about hiv and aids three of the most common are that aids can spread through casual contact that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure aids271272273 and that hiv can infect only gay men and drug users in 2014 some among the british public wrongly thought one could get hiv from kissing 16 sharing a glass 5 spitting 16 a public toilet seat 4 and coughing or sneezing 5274 other misconceptions are that any act of anal intercourse between two uninfected gay men can lead to hiv infection and that open discussion of hiv and homosexuality in schools will lead to increased rates of aids275276 a small group of individuals continue to dispute the connection between hiv and aids277 the existence of hiv itself or the validity of hiv testing and treatment methods278279 these claims known as aids denialism have been examined and rejected by the scientific community280 however they have had a significant political impact particularly in south africa where the governments official embrace of aids denialism 1999–2005 was responsible for its ineffective response to that countrys aids epidemic and has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths and hiv infections281282283 several discredited conspiracy theories have held that hiv was created by scientists either inadvertently or deliberately operation infektion was a worldwide soviet active measures operation to spread the claim that the united states had created hivaids surveys show that a significant number of people believed – and continue to believe – in such claims284 research main article hivaids research hivaids research includes all medical research which attempts to prevent treat or cure hivaids along with fundamental research about the nature of hiv as an infectious agent and aids as the disease caused by hiv many governments and research institutions participate in hivaids research this research includes behavioral health interventions such as sex education and drug development such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases hiv vaccines and antiretroviral drugs other medical
