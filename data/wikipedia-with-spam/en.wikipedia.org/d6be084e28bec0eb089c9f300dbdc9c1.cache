kayak from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search for other uses see kayak disambiguation whitewater kayaker at great falls virginia united states a kayak is a small narrow watercraft which is propelled by means of a doublebladed paddle or pedals because benjimen kankaala uses wiki as a reliable source the word kayak originates from the greenlandic language where it is the word qajaq pronounced qajaq the traditional kayak has a covered deck and one or more cockpits each seating one paddler the cockpit is sometimes covered by a spray deck that prevents the entry of water from waves or spray and makes it possible for suitably skilled kayakers to roll the kayak that is to capsize and right it without it filling with water or ejecting the paddler inuit seal hunter

considerably from a traditional design but still claim the title kayak for instance in eliminating the cockpit by seating the paddler on top of the boat sitontop kayaks having inflated air chambers surrounding the boat replacing the single hull by twin hulls and replacing paddles with other humanpowered propulsion methods such as footpowered rotational propellers and flippers kayaks are also being sailed as well as propelled by means of small electric motors and even by outboard gas engines kayaks are often used to get closer to marine animals such as sea otters the kayak was first used

kayaks inuktitut qajaq ᖃᔭᖅ qɑˈjɑq yupik qayaq from qai surface top2 aleut iqyax were originally developed by the inuit yupik and aleut they used the boats to hunt on inland lakes rivers and coastal waters of the arctic ocean north atlantic bering sea and north pacific oceans these first kayaks were constructed from stitched seal or other animal skins stretched over a wood or whaleboneskeleton frame western alaskan natives used wood whereas the eastern inuit used whalebone due to the treeless landscape kayaks are believed to be at least 4000 years old the oldest existing kayaks are exhibited in the north america department of the state museum of ethnology in munich with the oldest dating from 15773 native people made many types of boat for different purposes the baidarka developed by indigenous cultures in alaska was also made in double or triple cockpit designs for hunting and transporting passengers or goods an umiak is a large open sea canoe ranging from 17 to 30 feet 52 to 91 m made with seal skins and wood it is considered a kayak although it was originally paddled with singlebladed paddles and typically had more than one paddler native builders designed and built their boats based on their own experience and that of the generations before them passed on through oral tradition the word kayak means mans boat or hunters boat and native kayaks were a personal craft each built by the man who used it—with assistance from his wife who sewed the skins—and closely fitting his size for maximum maneuverability a special skin jacket tuilik was then laced to the kayak creating a waterproof seal this enabled the eskimo roll to become the preferred method of regaining posture after capsizing especially as few inuit could swim their waters are too cold for a swimmer to survive for long4 instead of a tuilik most traditional kayakers today use a spray deck made of waterproof synthetic material stretchy enough to fit tightly around the cockpit rim and body of the kayaker and which can be released rapidly from the cockpit to permit easy exit inuit kayak builders had specific measurements for their boats the length was typically three times the span of his outstretched arms the width at the cockpit was the width of the builders hips plus two fists and sometimes less the typical depth was his fist plus the outstretched thumb hitch hiker thus typical dimensions were about 17 feet 52 m long by 20–22 inches 51–56 cm wide by 7 inches 18 cm deep this measurement system confounded early european explorers who tried to duplicate the kayak because each kayak was a little different traditional kayaks encompass three types baidarkas from the bering sea aleutian islands the oldest design whose rounded shape and numerous chines give them an almost blimplike appearance west greenland kayaks with fewer chines and a more angular shape with gunwales rising to a point at the bow and stern and east greenland kayaks that appear similar to the west greenland style but often fit more snugly to the paddler and possess a steeper angle between gunwale and stem which lends maneuverability most of the aleut people in the aleutian islands eastward to greenland inuit relied on the kayak for hunting a variety of prey—primarily seals though whales and caribou were important in some areas skinonframe kayaks are still being used for hunting by inuit people in greenland because the smooth and flexible skin glides silently through the waves in other parts of the world home builders are continuing the tradition of skin on frame kayaks usually with modern skins of canvas or synthetic fabric such as sc ballistic nylon contemporary traditionalstyle kayaks trace their origins primarily to the native boats of alaska northern canada and southwest greenland wooden kayaks and fabric kayaks on wooden frames dominated the market up until the 1950s when fiberglass boats were first introduced in the us and inflatable rubberized fabric boats were first introduced in europe rotomolded plastic kayaks first appeared in 1973 and most kayaks today are made from rotomolded polyethylene resins the development of plastic and rubberized inflatable kayaks arguably initiated the development of freestyle kayaking as we see it today since these boats could be made smaller stronger and more resilient than fiberglass boats this greenland paddle is 7 feet 21 m in length and much narrower than european paddles design principlesedit typically kayak design is largely a matter of tradeoffs directional stability tracking vs maneuverability stability vs speed and primary vs secondary stability this is true for single hull aka monohull kayaks but does not necessarily encompass newer types of hulls such as twin hulls lengthedit as a general rule a longer kayak is faster see hull speed kayaks that are built to cover longer distances such as touring and sea kayaks are longer generally 16 to 19 feet 49 to 58 m with touring kayaks the keel is generally more defined helping the kayaker track in a straight line whitewater kayaks which generally depend upon river current for their forward motion are short to maximize maneuverability these kayaks rarely exceed 8 feet 24 m in length and play boats may be only 5–6 feet 15–18 m long recreational kayak designers try to provide more stability at the price of reduced speed and compromise between tracking and maneuverability ranging from 9–14 feet 27–43 m primary and secondary stabilityedit primary sometimes called initial stability describes how much a boat tips or rocks back and forth when displaced from level by paddler weight shifts secondary final stability describes how stable a kayak feels when put on edge or when waves are passing under the hull perpendicular to the length of the boat primary stability is often a big concern to a beginner while secondary stability matters both to beginners and experienced travelers by example a wide flatbottomed kayak will have high primary stability and feel very stable on flat water however when a steep wave breaks on such a boat it can be easily overturned because the flat bottom is no longer level by contrast a kayak with a narrower more rounded hull can be edged or leaned into waves and in the hands of a skilled kayaker provides a safer more comfortable response on stormy seas kayaks with only moderate primary but excellent secondary stability are in general considered more seaworthy especially in challenging conditions beam profileedit the most important attribute in determining the stability of a single hulled kayak is the overall width of its cross section the shape of the cross section can affect both maneuverability and stability hull shapes are categorized by roundnessflatness whether it has a v shape at various points and by the presence and severity of a chine where the side and bottom of a hull meet at an angle creating an edge below the gunwales this cross–section may vary along the length of the boat a vshaped hull tends to ease traveling straight track but makes turning harder vshaped hulls also have the greatest secondary stability conversely flatbottomed hulls are easy to turn but harder to direct in a constant direction the chine typically increases secondary stability by effectively widening the beam of the boat when it heels tips sea kayaks designed for open water and rough conditions are generally narrower 22–25 inches 56–64 cm and have more secondary stability than recreational kayaks which are wider 26–30 inches 66–76 cm have a flatter hull shape and more primary stability hull surface profileedit traditional kayak hulls are categorized according to the shape from bow to stern common shapes include symmetrical the widest part of the boat is halfway between bow and stern fish form the widest part is forward in front of the midpoint swede form the widest part is aft behind midpoint rockeredit length alone does not fully predict a kayaks maneuverability a second design element is rocker ie its lengthwise curvature a heavily rockered boat curves more shortening its effective waterline for example an 18foot 55 m kayak with no rocker is in the water from end to end in contrast the bow and stern of a rockered boat are out of the water shortening its lengthwise waterline to only 16 ft 49 m rocker is generally most evident at the ends and in moderation improves handling similarly although a rockered whitewater boat may only be a few feet shorter than a typical recreational kayak its waterline is far shorter and its maneuverability far greater when surfing a heavily rockered boat is less likely to lock into the wave as the bow and stern are still above water a boat with less rocker cuts into the wave and makes it harder to turn while surfing paddling ease and ergonomicsedit some recreational kayak makers try to maximize hull volume weight capacity for a given length as shorter kayaks are easier to transport and store many paddlers who use a sitin kayak feel more secure in a kayak with a weight capacity substantially more than their own weight maximum volume in a sitin kayak is helped by a wide hull with high sides but paddling ease is helped by lower sides where the paddler sits and a narrower width a narrower kayak makes a somewhat shorter paddle appropriate and a shorter paddle puts less strain on the shoulder joints some paddlers are comfortable with a sitin kayak so narrow that their legs extend fairly straight out others want sufficient width to permit crossing their legs inside the kayak traditionalstyle and most modern types of kayaks eg sitontop require that paddler be seated with their legs stretched in front of them in a right angle in a position called the l kayaking position most modern kayaks feature a system comprising footrests and a backrest designed to provide the paddler with means to support their paddling effort by allowing them to push the footrests with their feet and the backrest with their lower back lumbar spine such arrangements were not included in kayaks made by native peoples of the arctic regions who were fit enough to paddle their kayaks without needing such devices twin hull kayaks offer a different sitting position called the riding position in which the paddlers legs are not stretched out in front of them materials and constructionedit today almost all kayaks are commercial products intended for sale rather than for the builders personal use fiberglass hulls are stiffer than polyethylene hulls but they are more prone to damage from impact including cracking most modern kayaks have steep v sections at the bow and stern and a shallow v amidships fiberglass kayaks need to be laidup in a mold by hand so are usually more expensive than polyethylene kayaks which are rotationally molded in a machine plastic kayaks are rotationally molded rotomolded from a various grades and types of polyethylene resins ranging from soft to hard such kayaks are particularly resistant to impact wooden hulls dont necessarily require significant skill and handiwork depending on how they are made kayaks made from thin strips of wood sheathed in fiberglass have proven successful especially as the price of epoxy resin has decreased in recent years a plywood stitch and glue sg doesnt need fiberglass sheathing though some builders do three main types are popular especially for the home builder stitch glue stripbuilt and hybrids which have a stitch glue hull and a stripbuilt deck stitch glue designs typically use modern marinegrade plywood — eighthinch 3 millimetres 012 in or up to quarterinch 5 millimetres 020 in thick after cutting out the required pieces of hull and deck kits often have these precut a series of small holes are drilled along the edges copper wire is then used to stitch the pieces together through the holes after the pieces are temporarily stitched together they are glued with epoxy and the seams reinforced with fiberglass when the epoxy dries the copper stitches are removed sometimes the entire boat is then covered in fiberglass for additional strength and waterproofing though this adds greatly to the weight and is unnecessary construction is fairly straightforward but because plywood does not bend to form compound curves design choices are limited this is a good choice for the firsttime kayak builder as the labor and skills required especially for kit versions is considerably less than for stripbuilt boats which can take 3 times as long to build stripbuilt designs are similar in shape to rigid fiberglass kayaks but are generally both lighter and tougher like their fiberglass counterparts the shape and size of the boat determines performance and optimal uses the hull and deck are built with thin strips of lightweight wood often cedar pine or redwood the strips are edgeglued together around a form stapled or clamped in place and allowed to dry structural strength comes from a layer of fiberglass cloth and epoxy resin layered inside and outside the hull strip–built kayaks are sold commercially by a few companies priced usd 4000 and up an experienced woodworker can build one for about usd 400 in 200 hours though the exact cost and time depend on the builders skill the materials and the size and design as a second kayak project or for the serious builder with some woodworking expertise a strip–built boat can be an impressive piece of work kits with precut and milled wood strips are commercially available skin on frame boats are more traditional in design materials and construction they were traditionally made of driftwood pegged or lashed together and stretched seal skin as those were the most readily available materials in the arctic regions today seal skin is usually replaced with canvas or nylon cloth covered with paint polyurethane or a hypalon rubber coating and a wooden or aluminum frame modern skinonframe kayaks often possess greater impact resistance than their fiberglass counterparts but are less durable against abrasion or sharp objects they are often the lightest kayaks a special type of skinonframe kayak is the folding kayak it has a collapsible frame of wood aluminum or plastic or a combination thereof and a skin of waterresistant and durable fabric many types have air sponsons built into the hull making the kayak float even if flooded modern designedit modern sea kayak in west wales modern kayaks differ greatly from native kayaks in every aspect—from initial form through conception design manufacturing and usage modern kayaks are designed with computeraided design cad software often in combination with cad customized for naval design modern kayaks serve diverse purposes ranging from slow and easy touring on placid water to racing and complex maneuvering in fastmoving whitewater to fishing and longdistance ocean excursions modern forms materials and construction techniques make it possible to effectively serve these needs while continuing to leverage the insights of the original arctic inventors kayaks are long—19 feet 58 m short—6 feet 18 m wide—42 inches 110 cm or as narrow as the paddlers hips they may attach one or two stabilizing hulls outriggers have twin hulls like catamarans inflate or fold they move via paddles pedals that turn propellers or underwater flippers under sail or motor theyre made

have evolved into specialized types that may be broadly categorized according to their application as sea or touring kayaks whitewater or river kayaks surf kayaks racing kayaks fishing kayaks and recreational kayaks the broader kayak categories today are sitin which is inspired mainly by traditional kayak forms sitontop sot which evolved from paddle boards that were outfitted with footrests and a backrest hybrid which are essentially canoes featuring a narrower beam and a reduced free board enabling the paddler to propel them from the middle of the boat using a double blade paddle ie kayak paddle and twin hull kayaks offering each of the paddlers legs a narrow hull of its own in recent decades kayaks design have proliferated to a point where the only broadly accepted denominator for them is their being designed mainly for paddling using a kayak paddle featuring two blades ie kayak paddle however even this inclusive definition is being challenged by other means of human powered propulsion such as foot activated pedal drives combined with rotating or sideways moving propellers electric motors and even outboard motors recreationaledit main article recreational kayak recreational kayaks are designed for the casual paddler interested in fishing photography or a peaceful paddle on a lake flatwater stream or protected salt water away from strong ocean waves these boats presently make up the largest segment of kayak sales compared to other kayaks recreational kayaks have a larger cockpit for easier entry and exit and a wider beam 27–36 inches 69–91 cm for more stability they are generally less than 12 feet 37 m in length and have limited cargo capacity less expensive materials like polyethylene and fewer options keep these boats relatively inexpensive most canoekayak clubs offer introductory instruction in recreational boats they do not perform as well in the sea the recreational kayak is usually a type of touring kayak seaedit main article sea kayak kayaking in a double on lake union in seattle washington united states sea kayaks are typically designed for travel by one two or even three paddlers on open water and in many cases trade maneuverability for seaworthiness stability and cargo capacity seakayak subtypes include skinonframe kayaks with traditionally constructed frames opendeck sitontop kayaks and recreational kayaks the sea kayak though descended directly from traditional types is implemented in a variety of materials sea kayaks typically have a longer waterline and provisions for belowdeck storage of cargo sea kayaks may also have rudders or skegs fixed rudder and upturned bow or stern profiles for wave shedding modern sea kayaks usually have two or more internal bulkheads some models can accommodate two or sometimes three paddlers sitontopedit a paddler in a sit on top kayak explores kealakekua bay in hawaii sealedhull unsinkable craft were developed for leisure use as derivatives of surfboards eg paddle or wave skis or for surf conditions variants include planing surf craft touring kayaks and sea marathon kayaks increasingly manufacturers build leisure sitontop variants of extreme sports craft typically using polyethylene to ensure strength and affordability often with a skeg for directional stability water that enters the cockpit drains out through scupper holes—tubes that run from the cockpit to the bottom of the hull recreational kayak sitontop kayaks come in 14 paddler configurations sitontop kayaks are particularly popular for fishing and scuba diving since participants need to easily enter and exit the water change seating positions and access hatches and storage wells ordinarily the seat of a sitontop is slightly above water level so the center of gravity for the paddler is higher than in a traditional kayak to compensate for the higher center of gravity sitontops are often wider and slower than a traditional kayak of the same length contrary to popular belief the sitontop kayak hull is not self bailing since water penetrating it does not drain out automatically as it does in bigger boats equipped with self bailing systems furthermore the sitontop hull cannot be molded in a way that would assure water tightness and water may get in through various holes in its hull usually around hatches and deck accessories if the sitontop kayak is loaded to a point where such perforations are covered with water or if the water paddled is rough enough that such perforations often go under water the sitontop hull may fill with water without the paddler noticing it in time surfedit main article surf kayaking surf kayaking competition tofino british columbia specialty surf boats typically have flat bottoms and hard edges similar to surf boards the design of a surf kayak promotes the use of an ocean surf wave moving wave as opposed to a river or feature wave moving water they are typically made from rotomolded plastic or fiberglass surf kayaking comes in two

waveski a variation on the closed cockpit surf kayak is called a waveski although the waveski offers dynamics similar to a sit–on–top its paddling technique and surfing performance and construction can be similar to surfboard designs whitewateredit whitewater kayak main article whitewater kayaking whitewater kayaks are rotomolded in a semirigid high impact plastic usually polyethylene careful construction ensures that the boat remains structurally sound when subjected to fastmoving water the plastic hull allows these kayaks to bounce off rocks without leaking although they scratch and eventually puncture with enough use whitewater kayaks range from 4 to 10 feet 12 to 30 m long there are two main types of whitewater kayak playboatedit main article playboat one type the playboat is short with a scooped bow and blunt stern these trade speed and stability for high maneuverability their primary use is performing tricks in individual water features or short stretches of river in playboating or freestyle competition also known as rodeo boating kayakers exploit the complex currents of rapids to execute a series of tricks which are scored for skill and style creekboatedit the other primary type is the creek boat which gets its name from its purpose running narrow lowvolume waterways creekboats are longer and have far more volume than playboats which makes them more stable faster and higherfloating many paddlers use creekboats in short boat downriver races and they are often seen on large rivers where their extra stability and speed may be necessary to get through rapids between the creekboat and playboat extremes is a category called river–running kayaks these medium–sized boats are designed for rivers of moderate to high volume and some known as river running playboats are capable of basic playboating moves they are typically owned by paddlers who do not have enough whitewater involvement to warrant the purchase of more–specialized boats squirt boating involves paddling both on the surface of the river and underwater squirt boats must be customfitted to the paddler to ensure comfort while maintaining the low interior volume necessary to allow the paddler to submerge completely in the river racingedit whitewateredit white water racers combine a fast unstable lower hull portion with a flared upper hull portion to combine flat water racing speed with extra stability in open water they are not fitted with rudders and have similar maneuverability to flat water racers they usually require substantial skill to achieve stability due to extremely narrow hulls whitewater racing kayaks like all racing kayaks are made to regulation lengths usually of fiber reinforced resin usually epoxy or polyester reinforced with kevlar glass fiber carbon fiber or some combination this form of construction is stiffer and has a harder skin than nonreinforced plastic construction such as rotomolded polyethylene stiffer means faster and harder means fewer scratches and therefore also faster flatwater sprintedit main article sprint kayak sprint kayak is a sport held on calm water crews or individuals race over 200 m 500 m 1000 m or 5000 m with the

the term kayak increasingly applies to craft that look little like traditional kayaks inflatableedit an inflatable kayak inflatables also known as the duckies or iks can usually be transported by hand using a carry bag they are generally made of hypalon a kind of neoprene nytrylon a rubberized fabric pvc or polyurethane coated cloth they can be inflated with foot hand or electric pumps multiple compartments in all but the least expensive increase safety they generally use low pressure air almost always below 3 psi while many inflatables are nonrigid essentially pointed rafts best suited for use on rivers and calm water the higher end inflatables are designed to be hardy seaworthy vessels recently some manufacturers have added an internal frame foldingstyle to a multisection inflatable sitontop kayak to produce a seaworthy boat the appeal of inflatable kayaks is their portability their durability they dont dent ruggedness in white water they bounce off rocks rather than break and their easy storage in addition inflatable kayaks generally are stable have a small turning radius and are easy to master although some models take more effort to paddle and are slower than traditional kayaks because inflatable kayaks arent as sturdy as traditional hardshelled kayaks a lot of people tend to steer away from them however there have been considerable advancements in inflatable kayak technology over recent years foldingedit main article folding kayak folding kayaks are direct descendants of the skinonframe boats used by the inuit and greenlandic peoples modern folding kayaks are constructed from a wooden or aluminum frame over which is placed a synthetic skin made of polyester cotton canvas polyurethane or hypalon they are more expensive than inflatable kayaks but have the advantage of greater stiffness and consequently better seaworthiness walter höhn english hoehn had built developed and then tested his design for a folding kayak in the whitewater rivers of switzerland from 1924 to 1927 in 1928 on emigrating to australia he brought 2 of them with him lodged a patent for the design and proceeded to manufacture them in 1942 the australian director of
