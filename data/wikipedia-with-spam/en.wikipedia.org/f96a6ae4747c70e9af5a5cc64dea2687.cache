overviewedit as of july 2015 hbos programming is available to approximately 36493000 households with at least one television set 313 of all cable satellite and telco customers in the united states 36013000 subscribers or 309 of all households with pay television service receive at least hbos primary channel8 making it the second largest premium channel in the united states encore owned by starz inc reaches 4054 million pay television households as of july 2015update89 in addition to its us subscriber base hbo distributes content in at least 151 countries10 with approximately 130 million subscribers worldwide6 hbo subscribers generally pay for an extra tier of service that includes other cable and satelliteexclusive channels even before paying for the channel itself though hbo often prices all of its channels together in a single package however a law imposed by the federal communications commission fcc requires that cable providers allow subscribers to get just limited basic cable a base programming tier that includes local and in some areas outofmarket broadcast stations and public educational and government access channels and premium services such as hbo without subscribing to expanded service comcast is the only major provider to have purposefully offered the network in such a manner utilizing this law as it offered a bundled cableinternet package that included limited basic service and hbo from october 2013 to july 2014 or january of the latter year in some markets111213 cable providers can require the use of a converter box – usually digital – in order to receive hbo hbo also provides its content through digital media the channel maintains hbo go a video on demand streaming service available as a website and slate of mobile apps exclusively to existing subscribers of the linear channel suite and a separate but similar standalone service hbo now which launched in april 2015 as a subscription streaming platform that does not require a subscription to the hbo television service1415 many hbo programs have been syndicated to other networks and broadcast television stations usually after some editing for running time andor content that indecency regulations enforced by jurisdictional telecommunications agencies or selfimposed by network standards and practices departments may prohibit from airing on broadcast and cable networks and a number of hboproduced series and films have been released on dvd since hbos more successful series most notably shows such as sex and the city the sopranos the wire entourage six feet under boardwalk empire game of thrones and true blood air on overtheair broadcasters in other countries such as in canada australia and much of europe – including the united kingdom hbos programming has the potential of being exposed to a higher percentage of the population of those countries compared to the united states because of the cost of hbo which is the most expensive of the us premium services costing a monthly fee as of 2015update between 15 and 20 depending on the provider many americans only view hbo programs through dvds or in basic cable or broadcast syndication – months or even years after these programs have first aired on the network – and with editing for both content and to allow advertising although several series have filmed alternate clean scenes intended for syndication runs16 historyedit development and launchedit in 1965 charles dolan – who had already done pioneering work in the commercial use of cables and had developed teleguide a closedcircuit tourist information television system distributed to hotels in the new york metropolitan area – won a franchise to build a cable television system in the lower manhattan section of new york city17 the new system which dolan named sterling information services later to be known as sterling manhattan cable and eventually becoming the then time warner cable which merged into charter communications in 2016 became the first urban underground cable television system in the united states rather than stringing cable on telephone poles or using microwave antennas to receive the signals sterling laid cable beneath the streets of manhattan because the tall buildings in the city blocked television signals and because the new york city council had required that all electrical and telecommunication wiring be laid underground to limit service disruptions during bad weather an ordinance that was passed after a blizzard in 1888 damaged telephone and telegraph lines in the area18 in that same year timelife inc purchased a 20 stake in dolans company1920 sterling manhattan consistently lost money during its first six years of operation because of the expense of running cable underground and into buildings throughout manhattan as much as 300000 per mile and a limited subscriber base 400 of them by 1971 in the summer of 1971 while on a family vacation in france charles dolan began to think of ideas to make sterling manhattan profitable he came up with the concept for a cableoriginated television service called the green channel dolan later presented his idea to timelife management though satellite distribution seemed only a distant possibility at the time he persuaded timelife to back him on the project18 to gauge whether consumers would be interested in subscribing to a pay television service timelife sent out a directmail research brochure to residents in six us cities an overwhelming majority of those surveyed approximately 99 opposed the idea 4 of those polled in a second survey conducted by an independent consultant said they were almost certain to subscribe to such a service timelife later conducted a test in allentown pennsylvania in which salesmen presented the concept of a pay cable channel to residents by offering free service for the first month and a refundable installation fee half of residents surveyed in the test expressed interest in purchasing the conceptual service18 in a meeting of dolan and some timelife executives who were working on the project various other names were discussed for the new service they ultimately settled on calling it home box office although the name was originally intended as a working title in order to meet deadlines to publish research brochures for the new service with the belief that management would come up with a different name later18 original hbo logo used from 1972 to 1975 originally home box office was to debut on a service electric cable television system in allentown in order to avoid blackouts for nba games that it was set to televise allentown was within the nbas designated blackout radius for the philadelphia 76ers market area under rules that the league had in effect at the time to protect ticket sales timelife agreed to an offer by service electric president john walson to launch the channel on its system in wilkesbarre outside of the 76ers dma in northeastern pennsylvania18 home box office launched on november 8 197221 however hbos launch came without fanfare in the press as it was not covered by any local or national media outlets in addition the city manager of wilkesbarre declined an offer to attend the launch ceremony while time inc president and chief executive officer j richard munro was unable to attend as he was stranded in traffic while trying to exit manhattan on the george washington bridge on his way to wilkesbarre22 the first program and movie distributed on the channel the 1971 film sometimes a great notion starring paul newman and henry fonda was transmitted that evening to 325 service electric subscribers in wilkesbarre a plaque commemorating this event is located at public square in downtown wilkesbarre home box office distributed its first sports event immediately after the film an nhl hockey game between the new york rangers and the vancouver canucks from madison square garden2324 four months later in february 1973 home box office aired its first television special the pennsylvania polka festival25 home box office would use a network of microwave relay towers to distribute its programming to cable systems throughout its service area232627 sterling manhattan cable continued to lose money because the company had only a small subscriber base of 20000 customers in manhattan dolans media partner timelife inc gained control of sterling when it acquired an additional 60 equity interest increasing its stake in the company to 80 timelife then decided to pull the plug on the sterling manhattan operation timelife dropped the sterling name and the company was renamed manhattan cable television under timelifes control in march 197317 gerald levin who had been with home box office since it began operations as its vice president of programming replaced dolan as the companys president and chief executive officer28 in september 1973 timelife inc completed its acquisition of the pay service at the time home box offices future looked dim it only had 8000 subscribers across 14 cable systems all of which were located in pennsylvania22 and it was suffering from a significant subscriber churn rate hbo would eventually increase its fortunes within two years by april 1975 the service had around 100000 subscribers in pennsylvania and new york state and had begun to turn a limited profit22 national expansion innovation and rise to prominence 1975–1993edit the rca satcom domestic communication satellite launched on december 13 1975 spurred the cable television industry to unprecedented heights – with the assistance of hbo timelife executives realized the problems in trying to expand home box offices distribution footprint using microwave towers because of the time and expense that would be incurred in developing such a vast relay infrastructure and began looking for costefficient methods of transmitting the channel nationally in 1974 they settled on using a geostationary communications satellite to transmit hbo to cable providers throughout the united states other television broadcasters at the time were hesitant about uplinking their feeds to satellite due to fears that the satellites may inadvertently shut down or jettison out of their orbit as well as due to the cost of purchasing downlink receiver dishes which in 1974 were sold for as much as 75000 seeing satellite transmission as the only viable option to expand hbos reach gerald levin allocated 65 million to lease transponder space on the westar 1 satellite for a fiveyear term22 the timelife board subsequently approved the plan to transmit hbo via satellite28 at 900 pm eastern time on september 30 1975 hbo became the first television network to continuously deliver its signal via satellite when it distributed the thrilla in manila boxing match between muhammad ali and joe frazier it was beamed to ua columbia cablevisions systems in fort pierce and vero beach florida and american television and communications corporations jackson mississippi system29 as well as those already carrying hbo in the northeastern united states222630 through the use of satellite the channel began transmitting separate programming feeds for the eastern and pacific time zones allowing the same programs that air first in the eastern half of the united states to air at accordant times in the western part of the country31 hbo switched its domestic satellite transmissions from westar 1 to satcom 1 in february 1976 by 1977 ted turners atlanta superstation wtcgtv soon to become wtbs and pat robertsons cbn satellite service later to become the presentday freeform had joined it pioneering satellite delivery for the cable television industry2632 by 1980 hbo was carried on cable providers in all 50 us states22 first version of hbos currentupdate logo used from 1975 to 1981 during 1980 hbo used this logo in tandem with the second incarnation of the logo seen above in the infobox that is still used to this dayupdate hbo distributed its programming for only nine hours each day from 300 pm to 1200 am eastern time during its first nine years of operation the network first adopted a 24hour schedule on weekends in september 1981 running from 300 pm on friday afternoons until 1200 am eastern time on sunday nightsearly monday mornings 33this roundtheclock schedule was expanded to weekdays three months later on december 28 1981 however hbo was not the first pay television network to maintain an uninterrupted programming schedule as showtime and the movie channel had both switched to 24hour daily schedules months earlier by this time the full home box office name was deemphasized by the network in favor of branding solely by the hbo initialism although the full name is still used as the legal corporate name of its parent division under time warner34 and in onair use within copyright tags featured during the closing credits of the channels original programs and a legal disclaimer slide seen daily on its primary and multiplex channelscitation needed in 1983 hbo premiered its first original movie the terry fox story a biopic about the canadian runner who embarked on a crosscountry run across canada to raise money and awareness for cancer research the film was also the first movie ever produced for pay television that year also saw the premiere of the first childrens program to be distributed on the channel fraggle rock that series creator jim henson had earlier produced the special emmet otters jugband christmas which won an ace award in 197825 hbo continued to air various original programs aimed at children until 2001 when these programs almost completely moved over to hbo family which continued to occasionally distribute its own slate of original childrens programming until 200335 hbo became involved in several lawsuits during the 1980s involving legal statutes imposed by state and city laws that would have resulted in some programs on hbo and other pay television networks being censored by cable systems if not forcing the pay services to edit inappropriate content from the programming they aired in january 1986 hbo became the first satellitedelivered television network to encrypt its signal from unauthorized viewing by way of the videocipher ii system this initially resulted in a mass lodge of complaints from television receiveonly tvro satellite users that previously received hbos programming without a subscription31 the objections by tvro users over having to now pay for hbo as cable subscribers had long done requiring dish subscribers to purchase an expensive descrambler to unencrypt the signal came to a head four months later as hbo became a victim of broadcast signal intrusion when satellite television dealer john r macdougall a florida man calling himself captain midnight redirected a receiver dish towards the networks transponder on galaxy 1 and intercepted its signal during a movie presentation of the falcon and the snowman macdougall overrode the telecast of the film with a textbased message placed over smpte color bars in protest of the channels decision to scramble its signal for home satellite subscribers the federal communications commission subsequently prosecuted macdougall for committing the intrusion in 1988 hbos subscriber base expanded greatly as a result of the writers guild of america strike that year as the channel had new programming in its inventory during a period in which the broadcast networks were only able to air reruns of their shows in 1989 hbo compared its programming against rival pay television network showtime with the slogan simply the best using the tina turner single the best as part of the networks onair image campaign36 on january 2 1989 hbo launched selecciones en español de hbo y cinemax spanish selections from hbo and cinemax – an alternate spanishlanguage feed of hbo and cinemax the service which initially launched on 20 cable systems in markets with significant populations of spanish speakers37 originally only carried spanish audio simulcasts of live boxing matches televised by hbo except for certain events that were already distributed in spanish on networks such as galavisión dubbed versions of recent feature film releases from hbos movie suppliers and firstrun spanishlanguage movies mostly from mexico argentina and spain but later added spanish dubs of films and other programs distributed by hbo selecciones – which was offered in tandem with hbo although it operated as a separate service – utilized the second audio program auxiliary channel to distribute its spanish audio feeds selecciones en español de hbo y cinemax became successful to the point that it added 35 additional cable systems to its list of carriers within a few weeks after its debut37 selecciones en español became hbo en español on september 27 199338 taking advantage of hbos successes warner communications which ironically was partowner of one of the networks paycable competitors the movie channel from its launch in 1973 until joint venture group warneramex satellite entertainment sold its stake in the channel to viacom in 1986 merged with hbo parent time inc in 1989 to create time warner which as of 2016update remains the parent company of the network39 in 1991 hbo and cinemax became the first premium services to offer multiplexed channels to cable customers with the launches of hbo2 hbo3 and cinemax 2 on three cable systems in wisconsin kansas and texas40 in 1993 hbo became the worlds first digitally transmitted television service41 the move proved successful eventually resulting in hbo and cinemax starting up additional multiplex channels of both services – starting with the december 1996 launch of hbo family and concluding with the launch of four cinemax channels in 2001 wmax now moviemax max now cinemáx outermax and 5starmax rising prominence of original programming 1993–presentedit hbo headquarters in new york city april 2017 during the 1990s hbo began to experience increasing success with its original series such as tales from the crypt dream on tracey takes on mr show with bob and david and arliss one such program the larry sanders show arguably became hbos flagship series during that decade and although it was not commercially as successful as programs that aired on the big three networks abc nbc and cbs and fox the show did enjoy a cult status and critical acclaim and received nominations and wins for many major television awards including primetime emmy awards and golden globe awards42 the series ranked 38 on tv guides 50 greatest tv shows of all time becoming the only hbo comedy series to make the list43 and was also included in times list of the 100 best tv shows of all time44 the larry sanders show was also ranked by various critics and fans as one of the best tv comedies of the 1990s45 the original programs that hbo has developed since the early 1990s have earned the channel numerous nominations for and wins of emmy and golden globe awards46 one aspect as to the perceived higher quality of these shows is due to both the quality of the writing on the programs and the fact that as a subscriptiononly service hbo does not carry normal commercials instead the network runs promotions for upcoming hbo programs and behindthescenes featurettes between programs this relieves hbo from some pressures to tone down controversial aspects of its programs and allows for more explicit content to be incorporated into its shows that would not be allowed to air on broadcast television or basic cable such as profanity stronggraphic violence nudity and graphic sex scenes beginning with the 1997 launch of its first onehour dramatic narrative series oz hbo started a trend that became commonplace with premium cable services although critically acclaimed it was not until the sopranos premiered in 1999 that the network achieved both mass critical and emmy success the sopranos – centering on mob patriarch tony soprano james gandolfini and his family – received 111 emmy nominations during its sixseason run resulting in 21 wins two of them for outstanding drama series 1998 saw the debut of from the earth

historical events such as 61 band of brothers john adams and the pacific that year also saw the debut of the comedy series sex and the city which was based on the book series of the same name by candace bushnell over the course of its sixseason run the show – centering on the friendship and romances of four new york city women47 – received 54 emmy nominations winning seven including one win for outstanding comedy series in 1999 hbo became the first us cable channel to operate a highdefinition simulcast feed48 in july 2001 hbo launched hbo on demand the first premium subscription videoondemand enhancement in the united states to time warner cable subscribers in columbia south carolina49 in 2001 hbo debuted six feet under and in 2002 the wire which although not surpassing the sopranos in viewership success matched its critical acclaim and further cemented hbos reputation as a network that produced quality programmingcitation needed hbo experienced another success among viewers in 2008 with the debut of true blood a vampire drama based on a series of gothic novels by charlaine harris the network saw three more hit series in the 2010s with game of thrones based on george r r martins fantasy novel series a song of ice and fire which earned both critical and viewer praise girls a comedy series created by series star lena dunham and true detective an anthologystyle series – structured to feature a different cast and setting within each seasons storyline – which initially saw established film actors woody harrelson and matthew mcconaughey in its

services to cable customers as companions to the main network offering additional channels of the two services to three telecableoperated systems in overland park kansas racine wisconsin and the dallas suburbs of richardson and plano texas65 the first two multiplex channels – hbo2 and hbo3 – launched as part of this test by the telecable systems the following year research from acnielsen revealed that multiplex delivery of hbo and cinemax had a positive impact on subscriber usage and attitudes including aiding in the retention of pay cable subscriptions by its subscribers66 the hbo multiplex would later expand in december 1996 with the launch of hbo family focusing on familyoriented feature films and television series aimed at younger children67 the hbo multiplex channels became collectively marketed under the brand name hbo the works in april 1998 the cinemax channels concurrently began to be marketed as multimax coinciding with the name change of hbo2 as hbo plus the

free preview period and may not be carried on all systems owned by a multiple system operator unless at the providers discretion hbo currently offers between three and five preview events each year to participating providers which are normally scheduled to coincide with the premiere of a new or returning original series and in the past a highprofile special or feature film the network also produces short segments promoting new movies with the cooperation of the film studios that hold releasing rights to the projects these usually consist of either interstitial segments providing a behindthescenes look at the making of an upcomingrecently released film with interviews with the actors and principal crew or red carpet coverage which are almost universally produced by studios with which hbo and cinemax maintain exclusive premium television broadcast rights depending on their length or content these are either aired as part of the feature segment hbo news formerly titled hbo

features on dvd and bluray releases of the films that were profiled many of which have aired on hbo and cinemax once they reached their paycable distribution windows though broadcasts of these interstitials have begun to be reduced to only a few episodes per year as hbo has focused on its higherprofile longform original programming instead and studios have internally produced

september 30 1997136 the original full version begins with a window shot of a family or alternately a married couple in an apartment sitting down to watch hbo on their television set which was replaced by a cloudscape that faded into the city sequence in december 1983 which transitions to a flythrough over a constructed model cityscape and countryside a starburst – or stargate effect – then occurs following a pan towards a starfilled sky which begins a shorter version of the sequence unveiling a chromeplated hbo logo that flies and rotates into view colored light beams encircle the side of the o then flash to a partially animated sequence featuring more lights racing counterclockwise in its interior on a silver axis revealing hbo feature presentation or another program type such as standing room only hbo special or on location in block text before additional beams sweep across the text and shine with more flashing into a fade to black most variants of this sequence were discontinued in 1986 except for the feature presentation which was relegated to use only for the main prime time film saturday night movie and sunday night movie variants the latter two of which were discontinued in 1993 many versions of the intro are available on youtube including one uploaded to hbos official youtube channel137 the accompanying fanfare – originally composed for score productions by ferdinand jay smith iii of jay advertising who adapted the theme from the scherzo movement of antonín dvořáks ninth symphony – has become a musical signature for hbo and has been used in feature presentation upcoming program and evening schedule bumpers and network ids since 1998 with various arrangements from horns to piano being used over the years another wellknown hbo program opener neon lights began movies airing outside of primetime from november 1 1986 to september 30 1997 the sequence set to a synth and electric guitar theme begins with a purple hbo logo on a film strip with blue green and pink light rays shooting through it as the strip rotates out of view the lights shoot through several glowing cg slots until a flash of light hits a field of spheres in varying colors which zoom out to form a light purple hbo logo overlaid by a cursive magenta movie script against a black background with rows of light purple spheres138 from 1997 to 1999 hbo used several feature presentation bumpers designed by pittard sullivan featuring the network logo in different situations such as a fish in water a celebrity in a limousine a large hbo logo chasing a man and a neon hbo logo on the rooftop of a building these sequences were also used by the network as ids from 1997 to 2002 and in upcoming program and evening schedule bumpers until 2000 from september 1999 to april 1 2011 hbo used a pittard sullivandesigned cgi feature presentation bumper sequence that features a flyover similar to the 1982 sequence starting with the front of a movie theater featuring a marquee that reads hbo feature presentation and trekking through a country road a snowy mountain road near a cliff and a desert road respectively passing under a tower tunnel and tanker truck shaped in the individual letters of the hbo logotype this leads into a road in an urban neighborhood with skyscrapers visible in the background that becomes a bridge upon the citys downtown area and lead to a slowing flyover toward and pan over an hbo logoshaped lake that starts with several spotlights rapidly turning on and ends with a 3d animation of the feature presentation text the closing animation that is seen both in the full version as well as a shorter version of the sequence seen outside of weekend prime time films and saturday film premieres when the longer sequence was used139 the sequence was replaced on april 2 2011 – as part of a new graphics package implemented on that date across the hbo multiplex channels – by a much shorter opening sequence designed by jesse vartanian who also designed cgi teaser commercials for hbos premiere telecast of the 2010 film avatar consisting only of a dark background with faint light auroras around the hbo logo and a simple feature presentation text animation accompanied by soft orchestral music140 another new opening sequence done by imaginary forces was implemented on march 4 2017 the current intro combines liveaction and cgi while also paying homage to the original 1982 sequence to the point that the latter can be seen during the new intro141 unlike other pay television networks including the multiplex channels of sister channel cinemax hbo does not brand its programming with onscreen logo bugs of the main network and each respective multiplex channel – although its multiplex channels do display logo bugs during promotional breaks between programs142 network slogansedit source143 november 1972–august 1975 this is hbo the home box office premium subscription television from timelife august 1975–june 1976
