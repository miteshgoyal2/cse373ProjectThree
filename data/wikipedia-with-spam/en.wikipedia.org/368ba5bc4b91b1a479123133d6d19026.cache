launched on 2 november 1903 by alfred harmsworth later lord northcliffe as a newspaper for women run by women hence the name he said i intend it to be really a mirror of feminine life as well on its grave as on its lighter sides  to be entertaining without being frivolous and serious without being dull4 it cost one penny equivalent to 40p in 2017 it was not an immediate success and in 1904 harmsworth decided to turn it into a pictorial newspaper with a broader focus harmsworth appointed hamilton fyfe as editor and all of the papers female journalists were fired the masthead was changed to the daily illustrated mirror which ran from 26 january to 27 april 1904 issues 72 to 150 when it reverted to the daily mirror5 the first issue of the relaunched paper did not have advertisements on the front page as previously but instead news text and engraved pictures of a traitor and an actress with the promise of photographs inside6 two days later the price was dropped to one halfpenny and to the masthead was added a paper for men and women7 this combination was more successful by issue 92 the guaranteed circulation was 120000 copies8 and by issue 269 it had grown to 2000009 by then the name had reverted and the front page was mainly photographs circulation grew to 466000 making it the secondlargest morning newspaper10 alfred harmsworth sold the newspaper to his brother harold harmsworth from 1914 lord rothermere in 1913 in 1917 the price was increased to one penny11 circulation continued to grow in 1919 some issues sold more than a million copies a day making it the largest daily picture paper12 harold harmsworth 1st viscount rothermere lord rothermere was a friend of benito mussolini and adolf hitler and directed the mirrors editorial stance towards them in the early 1930s1314 by the mid1930s the mirror was struggling – it and the mail were the main casualties of the early 1930s circulation war that saw the daily herald and the daily express establish circulations of more than two million and rothermere decided to sell his shares in it in 1935 rothermere sold the paper to h g bartholomew and hugh cudlipp15 with cecil king rothermeres nephew in charge of the papers finances and guy bartholomew as editor during the late 1930s the mirror was transformed from a conservative middle class newspaper into a leftwing paper for the working class16 partly on the advice of the american advertising agency j walter thompson the mirror became the first british paper to adopt the appearance of the new york tabloids the headlines became bigger the stories shorter and the illustrations more abundant17 by 1939 the publication was selling 14 million copies a day in 1937 hugh mcclelland introduced his wild western comic strip beelzebub jones in the daily mirror after taking over as cartoon chief at the mirror in 1945 he dropped beelzebub jones and moved on to a variety of new strips during the second world war the mirror positioned itself as the paper of the ordinary soldier and civilian and was critical of the political leadership and the established parties at one stage the paper was threatened with closure following the publication of a philip zec cartoon captioned by william connor which was misinterpreted by winston churchill and herbert morrison18 in the 1945 general election the paper strongly supported the labour party in its eventual landslide victory in doing so the paper supported herbert morrison who coordinated labours campaign and recruited his former antagonist philip zec to reproduce on the front page a popular ve day cartoon on the morning of the election suggesting that labour were the only party who could maintain peace in postwar britain19 by the late 1940s it was selling 45 million copies a day outstripping the express for some 30 years afterwards it dominated the british daily newspaper market selling more than 5 million copies a day at its peak in the mid1960s the mirror was an influential model for german tabloid bild which was founded in 1952 and became europes biggestselling newspaper20 daily mirror building 19571960 in langham place london in 1955 the mirror and its stablemate the sunday pictorial later to become the sunday mirror began printing a northern edition in manchester in 1957 it introduced the andy capp cartoon created by reg smythe from hartlepool in the northern editions the mirrors mass working class readership had made it the united kingdoms bestselling daily tabloid newspaper in 1960 it acquired the daily herald the popular daily of the labour movement when it bought odhams in one of a series of takeovers which created the international publishing corporation ipc the mirror management did not want the herald competing with the mirror for readers and in 1964 relaunched it as a midmarket paper now named the sun when it failed to win readers the sun was sold to rupert murdoch – who immediately relaunched it as a more populist and sensationalist tabloid and a direct competitor to the mirror in an attempt to cater to a different kind of reader the mirror launched the mirrorscope pullout section on 30 january 1968 the press gazette commented the daily mirror launched its revolutionary fourpage supplement mirrorscope the ambitious brief for the supplement which ran on wednesdays and fridays was to deal with international affairs politics industry science the arts and business21 the british journalism review said in 2002 that mirrorscope was a game attempt to provide serious analysis in the rough and tumble of the tabloids22 it failed to attract significant numbers of new readers and the pullout section was abandoned its final issue appearing on 27 august 1974 in 1978 the sun overtook the mirror in circulation and in 1984 the mirror was sold to robert maxwell after maxwells death in 1991 david montgomery became mirror groups ceo and a period of costcutting and production changes ensued the mirror went through a protracted period of crisis before merging with the regional newspaper group trinity to form trinity mirror in 1999 printing of the daily and sunday mirror moved to trinity mirrors facilities in watford and oldham 1995–2004edit front page of the mirror 24 june 1996 with headline achtung surrender for you fritz ze euro 96 championship is over and accompanying contribution from the editor mirror declares football war on germany under the editorship of piers morgan from october 1995 to may 2004 the paper saw a number of controversies morgan was widely criticised and forced to apologise for the headline achtung surrender for you fritz ze euro 96 championship is over a day before england met germany in a semifinal of the euro 96 football championships23 in 2000 morgan was the subject of an investigation after suzy jagger wrote a story in the daily telegraph revealing that he had bought £20000 worth of shares in the computer company viglen soon before the mirror s city slickers column tipped viglen as a good buy24 morgan was found by the press complaints commission to have breached the code of conduct on financial journalism but kept his job the city slickers columnists anil bhoyrul and james hipwell were both found to have committed further breaches of the code and were sacked before the inquiry in 2004 further enquiry by the department of trade and industry cleared morgan from any charges25 on 7 december 2005 bhoyrul and hipwell were convicted of conspiracy to breach the financial services act during the trial it emerged that morgan had bought £67000 worth of viglen shares emptying his bank account and investing under his wifes name too26 in 2002 the mirror attempted to move midmarket claiming to eschew the more trivial stories of showbusiness and gossip the paper changed its masthead logo from red to black and occasionally blue in an attempt to dissociate itself from the term red top a term for a sensationalist massmarket tabloid on 6 april 2005 the red top came back under theneditor piers morgan the newspapers editorial stance opposed the 2003 invasion of iraq and ran many front pages critical of the war it also gave financial support to the 15 february 2003 antiwar protest paying for a large screen and providing thousands of placards morgan rehired john pilger who had been sacked during robert maxwells ownership of the mirror titles despite such changes morgan was unable to halt the papers decline in circulation a decline shared by its direct tabloid rivals the sun and the daily starcitation needed morgan was fired from the mirror on 14 may 2004 after authorising the newspapers publication of photographs allegedly showing iraqi prisoners being abused by british army soldiers from the queens lancashire regiment27 within days the photographs were shown to be fakes under the headline sorry we were hoaxed the mirror responded that it had fallen victim to a calculated and malicious hoax and apologised for the publication of the photographs28 2004–presentedit the mirrors front page on 4 november 2004 after the reelection of george w bush as us president read how can 59054087 people be so dumb it provided a list of states and their alleged average iq showing the bush states all below average intelligence except for virginia and all john kerry states at or above average intelligence the source for this table was the economist29 though it was a hoax30 richard wallace became editor in 2004 on 30 may 2012 trinity mirror announced the merger of the daily mirror and sunday mirror into a single sevendayaweek title31 richard wallace and tina weaver the respective editors of the daily mirror and sunday mirror were simultaneously dismissed and lloyd embley editor of the people appointed as editor of the combined title with immediate effect3233 political allegianceedit the daily mirror has traditionally backed the labour party at general elections on 3 may 1979 the day of the general election the daily mirror urged its readers to vote for the governing labour party led by james callaghan34 as widely predicted by the opinion polls labour lost this election which was won by the conservative party and saw margaret thatcher become prime minister34 the mirrors continued support of the labour government was in spite of its falling popularity over the previous few months which had been the result of the winter of discontent where the country was crippled by numerous public sector strikes35 by the time of the 1983 general election labour support was at a postwar low partly due to the strong challenge by the recently formed sdpliberal alliance despite this the daily mirror remained loyal to labour and urged its readers to vote for the party now led by michael foot condemning the thatcherled tory government for its waste of our nation34 condemning the rise in unemployment that thatchers conservative government had seen in its first term in power largely due to monetarist economic policies to reduce inflation though the governments previously low popularity had dramatically improved since the success of the falklands conflict a year earlier36 however the tories were reelected and labour suffered its worst postwar general election result only narrowly bettering the sdpliberal alliance in terms of votes though winning considerably more seats34 at the 1987 general election the daily mirror remained loyal to labour now led by neil kinnock and urged its readers you know hes right chuck her out34 by this stage unemployment was falling and inflation had remained low for several years37 however the tories were reelected for a third successive term although labour did cut the tory majority slightly34 for the 1992 general election the daily mirror continued to support labour still led by neil kinnock by this stage margaret thatcher had stepped down and the tory government was now led by john major34 the election was won by the tories although labour managed to significantly cut the tory majority to 21 seats compared to the tripledigit figure of the previous two elections which led to a difficult term for major the outcome of this election had been far less predictable than any of the previous three elections as opinion polls over the previous three years had shown both parties in the lead although any labour lead in the polls had been relatively narrow since the conservative governments change of leader from thatcher to major in november 1990 in spite of the onset of a recession in 1990 which had pushed unemployment up again after several years of decline labours credibility was helped by plans including extra nhs funding and moving away from firm commitments on renationalisation to reverse the conservative policy of privatisation but its decision to be upfront about tax increases was seen as a key factor in its failure to win38 by the time of the 1997 general election support for the labour party now led by tony blair in the opinion polls had exceeded that of support for the tory government still led by john major since late 1992 the governments reduced popularity largely blamed on the failings of black wednesday in september of that year and it had failed to recover popularity in spite of a strong economic recovery and fall in unemployment a reinvented new labour had further improved its credibility under blair by promising traditional labour essentials including more funding for healthcare and education but also promising not to increase income tax and ending its commitment to the nationalisation of leading industries39 the daily mirror urged its readers that their country needed tony blair and to vote labour34 the election produced a labour landslide and ended the partys 18year exile from power on 4 may 2010 the newspaper printed a picture of conservative leader david cameron with a giant red cross through his face the headline read how to stop him in reference to the general election two days later thus confirming the daily mirrors labour allegiance the election ended in britains first hung parliament since 1974 but cameron still became prime minister of the country within days as the conservatives formed a coalition with the liberal democrats the daily mirror was the only leading national newspaper to remain loyal to labour and gordon brown at a time when opinion polls showed them on course for their worst election result since 198340 the newspaper has been critical of the liberal democrats for forming the coalition which enabled the conservatives to form a new government in 2010 it has branded leader nick clegg as pinickio in comparison with the lying fictional character pinocchio41 for going back on numerous preelection pledges it has frequently referred to the party as the fib

a marketing exercise with pepsicola who on the same day had decided to relaunch their cans with a blue design instead of the traditional red and white logo libel contempt of court errors and criticismedit front page of the daily mirror after publishing faked photographs in may 2004 the daily mirror published what it claimed were photos of british soldiers abusing iraqi prisoners at an unspecified location in iraq the decision to publish the photos subsequently shown to be hoaxes led to morgans sacking as editor on 14 may 2004 the daily mirror then stated that it was the subject of a calculated and malicious hoax45 the newspaper issued a statement apologising for the printing of the pictures the papers deputy editor des kelly took over as acting editor during the crisis the tabloids rival the sun offered a £50000 reward for the arrest and conviction of those accused of faking the mirror photographs in november 2007 the daily mirror paid damages to sir andrew green after having likened him and his group migrationwatch uk to the ku klux klan and nazi party in september of that year the newspaper admitted that such allegations were untrue46 in february 2008 both the daily and the sunday mirror implied that tv presenter kate garraway was having an affair she sued for libel receiving an apology and compensation payment in april 200847 on 18 september 2008 david anderson a british sports journalist writing for the mirror repeated a claim deriving from vandalism on wikipedias entry for cypriot football team ac omonia which asserted that their fans were called the zany ones and liked to wear hats made from discarded shoes the claim was part of andersons match preview ahead of ac omonias game with manchester city which appeared in the web and print versions of the mirror with the nickname also quoted in subsequent editions on 19 september4849 the episode was featured in private eye on 12 may 2011 the high court of england and wales granted the attorney general permission to bring a case for contempt against the sun and the daily mirror for the way they had reported on the arrest of a person of interest in the murder of joanna yeates5051 on 29 july the court ruled that both newspapers had been in contempt of court fining the daily mirror £50000 and the sun £1800052 on 19 july 2011 the mirror published an article labelling comedian frankie boyle as a racist he later sued for defamation and libel winning £54650 in damages and a further £4250 for a claim about his departure from mock the week the mirror had argued he was forced to quit but this was found to be libellous by the court5354 on 20 march 2017 the mirror painted the traditional russian pancake celebration maslenitsa as a hooligan training ground one of the centuriesold tradition in this russian festival is “walltowall” ‘stenka na stenku’ ru which is sparring between men dressed in traditional folk clothes this tradition was wrongly represented by the mirror in the pictures and text labeled as violent acts and living in fear without giving context or any information about this russian traditional festival at all the mirror article was titled “russias ultra yobs infiltrated amid warnings england fans could be killed at world cup” and received negative receptions from russian media and was also labeled as fake news55565758 the organizers of the traditional russian folk festival event are looking to sue the daily mirror it is reported later59 representatives of daily mirror acknowledged that the original material of the publication about russian hooligans was incorrectly illustrated with images of the traditional festival in the updated version of the article the newspaper continues to insist that the photographed people were hooligans in the pictures but gives no evidence of their participation in the festival60 significant staff membersedit editorsedit 1903 to 1904 mary howarth 1904 to 1907 hamilton fyfe 1907 to 1915 alexander kenealy 1915 to 1916 ed
