historyedit the modern washington department of corrections is a relatively young state agency agency oversight of correctional institutions in washington state went through several transitions during the 20th century before the wadocs creation in 1981 prior to the 1970s state correctional facilities were managed by the washington department of institutions6 governor daniel j evans consolidated the department of institutions department of public assistance vocational rehabilitation and other related departments into the washington state department of social and health services dshs in the 1970s78 on july 1 1981 the washington state legislature transferred the administration of adult correctional institutions from the washington state department of social and health services division of adult corrections dshs to the newly created washington state department of corrections as part of the 1981 corrections reform act9 organizational structureedit the washington department of corrections organizational structure includes five major divisions prisons community corrections administrative services health services offender change executive policy each division has an assistant secretary who oversees the divisions operations4 the secretary of corrections is the executive head of the department the secretary is appointed by the governor with the consent of the state senate4 department facilitiesedit prisonsedit see also list of washington state prisons the department currently operates 12 adult prisons of which 10 are male institutions and 2 are female institutions10 the department confines over 16000 people in these facilities with each varying in size and mission across the state11 work releasesedit see also list of washington state work releases the department currently has 16 work release facilities all but two of these facilities are operated by contractors who manage the daily safety and security and have oversight of the facilities fulltime 24hours a day 7days per week department staff are located onsite to assist in supervision monitoring and case management of those under supervision as well as monitoring of the contracts12 formerly incarcerated people housed in work release facilities have progressed from full confinement to partial confinement and are required to seek secure and maintain employment in the community as well as pay for their room and board this model is designed to provide some foundation for employment and housing when the formerly incarcerated are released to communities8 however a 2015 washington supreme court minority and justice commission symposium revealed that reentry resources for formerly incarcerated people in washington state are still severely underfunded and disconnected13 field officesedit community supervision occurs at varied locations in the community to include field offices community justice centers community oriented policing cop shops and outstations activities of supervised people in the community are monitored which includes home visits by a community corrections officer to ensure compliance with court or known as the indeterminate sentence review board which was the washington state board of prison terms and paroles isrb only those individuals who have been deemed rehabilitated by the isrb are placed on parole and department conditions of supervision such as community supervision andor community custody8 death rowedit see also capital punishment in washington in 2014 governor jay inslee announced a moratorium on carrying out the death penalty in washington state14 according to inslee “equal justice under the law is the state’s primary responsibility and in death penalty cases i’m not convinced equal justice is being served the use of the death penalty in this state is unequally applied sometimes dependent on the budget of the county where the crime occurred”14 the moratorium means that if a death penalty case comes to the governor’s desk for action he will issue a reprieve14 however this action does not commute the sentences of those on death row or issue any pardons14 the majority of washington’s death penalty sentences are overturned and those convicted of capital offenses are rarely executed indicating questionable sentencing in many cases14 since 1981 the year washington state’s current capital laws were put in place 32 defendants have been sentenced to die of those 18 have had their sentences converted to life in prison and one was set free14 prior to inslees moratorium washington’s capital punishment law required that capital punishment imposed by the state’s courts be carried out at the washington state penitentiary in walla walla procedures for conducting executions are supervised by the penitentiary superintendent15 washington utilizes two methods of execution lethal injection and hanging lethal injection is used unless the inmate under sentence of death chooses hanging as the preferred execution method15 within 10 days of a trial court entering a judgment and sentence imposing the death penalty male defendants under sentence of death are transferred to the penitentiary where they remain in a segregation unit intensive management unit north imun at the prison pending appeals and until a death warrant is issued setting the date for the execution female defendants under sentence of death are housed at the washington corrections center for women in gig harbor before being transferred to the penitentiary no later than 72 hours prior to a scheduled execution also housed in imu north although the execution chamber is

198626 he retired in 199726 riveland drew criticism from republican lawmakers who felt he was not harsh enough on incarcerated people26 however rivelands cautions against politicallydriven policies have proven prescient in the mass incarceration decades that followed his time as secretary27 by 2008 the quantity of people incarcerated in washington had more than tripled since the time riveland had first come to wadoc27 joseph d lehmanedit joe lehman was a graduate of st martins college and pacific lutheran university he spent 21 years as a probation and parole officer and deputy secretary

pacholke resigned after a short tenure amid controversy over a wadoc computer glitch that caused the somewhat early release of approximately 3000 incarcerated people over more than a decade3637 some formerly incarcerated people who had established new lives upon early release were reincarcerated in response to public and political outcry over the early releases37 the early release scandal became an expression of more complex political relationships in anticipation of the 2016 washington state election season in a resignation email to senator mike padden—one of the most conservative members of the washington state senates law and justice committee—pacholke wrote i notify you now of my resignation i hope it helps meet your need for blood i hope it gives you fodder for the press and fulfills your political needs so you can let this agency our agency heal38 former secretary of corrections bernie warner told the media he did not know about the computer glitch until notified by governor jay inslees general counsel39 however pacholke told the media that warner’s assistant secretary knew of the mistaken early release of prisoners as early as 201239 at least two people were killed in homicides linked to prisoners who had mistakenly been released early40 and families of the deceased in each of those cases went on to file wrongful death lawsuits against the agency4142 one of those lawsuits resulted in a 325 million settlement paid out by the doc43 since leaving wadoc pacholke has become the codirector at segregation solutions44 he has coauthored a report with sandy felkey
