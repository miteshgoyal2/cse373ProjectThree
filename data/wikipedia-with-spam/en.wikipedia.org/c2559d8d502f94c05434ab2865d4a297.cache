many bedrooms or bathrooms the property has4 according to the sites creators the walk score algorithm awards points based on the distance to the closest amenity in each category if the closest amenity in a category is within 25 miles or 4 km we assign the maximum number of points the number of points declines as the distance approaches 1 mile or 16 km—no points are awarded for amenities farther than 1 mile each category is weighted equally and the points are summed and normalized to yield a score from 0–100 the number of nearby amenities is the leading predictor of whether people walk7

relevancy in methodology and results1213 specifically walk score doesnt calculate whether there are sidewalks how many lanes of traffic one must cross how much crime occurs in the area or what the weather is typically like it also doesnt differentiate between types of amenities for example a supermarket grocery store versus a small food mart selling mostly chips and liquor walk score does not accurately score areas adjacent to international borders the algorithm prioritizes locations across the border which leads to low and inaccurate scores14 professional productsedit travel time apiedit
