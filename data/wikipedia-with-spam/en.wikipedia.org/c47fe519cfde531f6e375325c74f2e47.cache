pavarotti a baker and amateur tenor and adele venturi a cigar factory worker4 although he spoke fondly of his childhood the family had little money its four members were crowded into a tworoom apartment according to pavarotti his father had a fine tenor voice but rejected the possibility of a singing career because of nervousness world war ii forced the family out of the city in 1943 for the following year they rented a single room from a farmer in the neighbouring countryside where the young pavarotti developed an interest in farming after abandoning the dream of becoming a football goalkeeper pavarotti spent seven years in vocal training pavarottis earliest musical influences were his fathers recordings most of them featuring the popular tenors of the day – beniamino gigli giovanni martinelli tito schipa and enrico caruso pavarottis favourite tenor and idol was giuseppe di stefano and he was also deeply influenced by mario lanza saying in my teens i used to go to mario lanza movies and then come home and imitate him in the mirror at around the age of nine he began singing with his father in a small local church choir after what appears to have been a normal childhood with a typical interest in sports—in pavarottis case football above all he graduated from the scuola magistrale and faced the dilemma of a career choice he was interested in pursuing a career as a professional football goalkeeper but his mother convinced him to train as a teacher he subsequently taught in an elementary school for two years but finally allowed his interest in music to win out recognising the risk involved his father gave his consent only reluctantly pavarotti began the serious study of music in 1954 at the age of 19 with arrigo pola a respected teacher and professional tenor in modena who offered to teach him without remuneration according to conductor richard bonynge pavarotti never learned to read music5 in 1955 he experienced his first singing success when he was a member of the corale rossini a male voice choir from modena that also included his father which won first prize at the international eisteddfod in llangollen wales he later said that this was the most important experience of his life and that it inspired him to become a professional singer6 at about this time pavarotti first met adua veroni they married in 1961 when his teacher arrigo pola moved to japan pavarotti became a student of ettore campogalliani who at that time was also teaching pavarottis childhood friend mirella freni whose mother worked with lucianos mother in the cigar factory like pavarotti freni went on to become a successful opera singer they would go on to collaborate in various stage performances and recordings together during his years of musical study pavarotti held parttime jobs in order to sustain himself – first as an elementary school teacher and then as an insurance salesman the first six years of study resulted in only a few recitals all in small towns and without pay when a nodule developed on his vocal cords causing a disastrous concert in ferrara he decided to give up singing pavarotti attributed his immediate improvement to the psychological release connected with this decision whatever the reason the nodule not only disappeared but as he related in his autobiography everything i had learned came together with my natural voice to make the sound i had been struggling so hard to achieve career 1960s–1970s pavarotti began his career as a tenor in smaller regional italian opera houses making his debut as rodolfo in la bohème at the teatro municipale in reggio emilia in april 1961 with joan sutherland in i puritani 1976 he made his first international appearance in la traviata in belgrade yugoslavia

as rodolfo78 while generally successful pavarottis early roles did not immediately propel him into the stardom that he would later enjoy an early coup involved his connection with joan sutherland and her conductor husband richard bonynge who in 1963 had sought a young tenor taller than herself to take along on her tour to australia9 with his commanding physical presence pavarotti proved ideal10 the two sang some forty performances over two months and pavarotti later credited sutherland for the breathing technique that would sustain him over his career11 pavarotti made his american début with
