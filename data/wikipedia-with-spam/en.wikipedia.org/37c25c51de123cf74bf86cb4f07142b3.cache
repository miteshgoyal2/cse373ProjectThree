coulter accused nro of censorship and said that she was paid 5 per article nro dropped her column and terminated her editorship jonah goldberg editoratlarge of nro said we did not fire ann for what

2004 democratic national convention she wrote one article that began here at the spawn of satan convention in boston and referred to some unspecified female attendees as cornfed no makeup natural fiber nobra needing sandalwearing hirsute somewhat fragrant hippie chick pie wagons the newspaper declined to print the article citing an editing dispute over basic weaknesses in clarity and readability that we found unacceptable an explanatory article by the paper went on to say coulter told the online edition of editor publisher magazine that usa today doesnt like my tone humor sarcasm etc which raises the intriguing question of why they hired me to write for them usa today replaced coulter with jonah goldberg and coulter published it instead on her website545556 in august 2005 the arizona daily star dropped coulters syndicated column citing reader complaints that many readers find her shrill bombastic and meanspirited and those are the words used by readers who identified themselves as conservatives57 in july 2006 some newspapers replaced coulters column with those of other conservative columnists following the publication of her fourth book godless the church of liberalism58 after the augusta chronicle dropped her column newspaper editor michael ryan explained that it came to the point where she was the issue rather than what she was writing about59 ryan also stated that pulling ann coulters column hurts shes one of the clearest thinkers around she has criticized former president george w bushs immigration proposals saying they led to amnesty in a 2007 column she claimed that the current immigration system was set up to deliberately reduce the percentage of whites in the population in it she said60 in 1960 whites were 90 percent of the country the census bureau recently estimated that whites already account for less than twothirds of the population and will be a minority by 2050 other estimates put that day much sooner one may assume the new majority will not be such compassionate overlords as the white majority has been if this sort of drastic change were legally imposed on any group other than white americans it would be called genocide yet whites are called racists merely for mentioning the fact that current immigration law is intentionally designed to reduce their percentage in the population overall coulters columns are highly critical of liberals and democrats in 2006 she wrote61 this years democratic plan for the future is another inane sound bite designed to trick american voters into trusting them with national security to wit theyre claiming there is no connection between the war on terror and the war in iraq and while they are all for the war against terror—absolutely in favor of that war—they are adamantly opposed to the iraq war you know the war where the us military is killing thousands upon thousands of terrorists described in the media as iraqi civilians even if they are from jordan like the nowdead leader of alqaida in iraq abu musab alzarqawi that war television and radio ann coulter at the 2012 time 100 coulter made her first national media appearance in 1996 after she was hired by the thenfledgling

hussein mckeown contradicted her with no actually canada did not send troops to vietnam63 on the edition of february 18 2005 of washington journal coulter justified her statement by referring to the thousands of canadians who served in the american armed forces during the vietnam era either because they volunteered or because they were living in the united states during the war years and got drafted she said the canadian government didnt send troops  but  they came and fought with the americans so i was wrong it turns out there were 10000 americans who happened to be born in canada there were actually between 5000 and 20000 canadians who fought in vietnam itself including approximately 80 who were killed64 john cloud of time writing about the incident a few months later said canada

and this is your lucky day because im here to redeem you even though you dont deserve it and i have to get the crap kicked out of me to do it she then mocked the message of jesus according to liberals

interview with donny deutsch on the big idea during the interview coulter stated that the united states is a christian nation and said that she wants jews to be perfected as they say referring to them

comments on the show the antidefamation league american jewish committee and bradley burston condemned those comments88 and the national jewish democratic council asked media outlets to stop inviting coulter as a guest commentator89 talk show host dennis prager while disagreeing with her comments said that they were not antisemitic noting there is nothing in what ann coulter said to a jewish interviewer on cnbc that indicates she hates jews or wishes them ill or does damage to the jewish people or the jewish state and if none of those criteria is present how can someone be labeled antisemitic90 conservative activist david horowitz also defended coulter against the allegation91 coulter again sparked outrage in september 2015 when she tweeted in response to multiple republican candidates references to israel during a presidential debate how many f—ing jews do these people think there are in the united states92 the antidefamation league referred to the tweets as ugly

samesex marriage and once supported a federal us constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union of one man and one woman101 she insists that her opposition to samesex marriage wasnt an antigay thing and that its genuinely a promarriage position to oppose gay marriage102 in an april 1 2015 column coulter declared that liberals had won the war on gay marriage by judicial fiat103 she also opposes civil unions104 and privatizing marriage105 when addressed with the issue of rights granted by marriage she said gays already can visit loved ones in hospitals they can also visit neighbors

few years coulter has attracted many lgbt fans namely gay men and drag queens8113 at the 2007 cpac coulter said i do want to point out one thing that has been driving me crazy with the media—how they keep describing mitt romneys position as being progays and thats going to upset the right wingers and well you know screw you im not antigay were against gay marriage i dont want gays to be discriminated against she added i dont know why all gays arent republican i think we have the progay positions which is anticrime and for tax cuts gays make a lot of money and theyre victims of crime no they are they should be with us114 in coulters 2007 book if democrats had any brains theyd be republicans in the chapter gays no gay left behind she argued that republican policies were more progay than democratic policies coulter attended the 2010 homocon of goproud where she commented that samesex marriage is not a civil right115 on february 9 2011 in a column coulter described the national log cabin republicans as ridiculous and not conservative at all she did however describe the texas branch of log cabin republicans for whom shes been signing books for years as comprised of real conservatives116 at the 2011 cpac during her questionandanswer segment coulter was asked about goproud and the controversy over their exclusion from the 2011 cpac she boasted how she talked goproud into dropping its support for samesex marriage in the partys platform saying the left is trying to coopt gays and i dont think we should let them i think they should be on our side and gays are natural conservatives117 later that year coulter joined advisory board for goproud on logos the alist dallas she told gay republican taylor garrett that the gays have got to be prolife and as soon as

morgan live when she said that marijuana users cant perform daily functions122 political activities and commentary ann coulter has described herself as a polemicist who likes to stir up the pot and doesnt pretend to be impartial or balanced as broadcasters do3 while her political activities in the past have included advising a plaintiff suing president bill clinton as well as considering a run for congress she mostly serves as a political pundit sometimes creating controversy ranging from rowdy uprisings at some of the colleges where she speaks to protracted discussions in the media time magazines john cloud once observed that coulter likes to shock reporters by wondering aloud whether america might be better off if women lost the right to vote62 this was in reference to her statement that it would be a much better country if women did not vote that is simply a fact in fact in every presidential election since 1950—except goldwater in 64—the republican would have won if only the men had voted123 similarly in an october 2007 interview with the new york observer coulter said124 if we took away womens right to vote wed never have to worry about another democrat president its kind of a pipe dream its a personal fantasy of mine but i dont think its going to happen and it is a good way of making the point that women are voting so stupidly at least single women it also makes the point it is kind of embarrassing the democratic party ought to be hanging its head in shame that it has so much difficulty getting men to vote for it i mean you do see its the party of women and well pay for health care and tuition and day care—and here what else can we give you soccer moms in addition to questioning whether womens right to vote is a good thing coulter has also appeared on fox news and advocated for a poll tax and a literacy test for voters this was in 1999 and she reiterated her support of a literacy test in 2015125 this is not a viewpoint widely shared by members of the republican party paula jones – bill clinton case coulter first became a public figure shortly before becoming an unpaid legal adviser for the attorneys representing paula jones in her sexual harassment suit against president bill clinton coulters friend george conway had been asked to assist jones attorneys and shortly afterward coulter who wrote a column about the paula jones case for human events was also asked to help and she began writing legal briefs for the case coulter later stated that she would come to mistrust the motives of jones head lawyer joseph cammaratta who by august or september 1997 was advising jones that her case was weak and to settle if a favorable settlement could be negotiated15126 from the outset jones had sought an apology from clinton at least as eagerly as she sought a settlement127 however in a later interview coulter recounted that she herself had believed that the case was strong that jones was telling the truth that clinton should be held publicly accountable for his misconduct and that a settlement would give the impression that jones was merely interested in extorting money from the president15 david daley who wrote the interview piece for the hartford courant recounted what followed coulter played one particularly key role in keeping the jones case alive in newsweek reporter michael isikoffs new book uncovering clinton a reporters story coulter is unmasked as the one who leaked word of clintons distinguishing characteristic—his reportedly bent penis that jones said she could recognize and describe—to the news media her hope was to foster mistrust between the clinton and jones camps and forestall a settlement i thought if i leaked the distinguishing characteristic it would show bad faith in negotiations clinton lawyer bob bennett would think jones had leaked it cammaratta would know he himself hadnt leaked it and would get mad at bennett it might stall negotiations enough for me to get through to jones adviser susan carpentermcmillan to tell her that i thought settling would hurt paula that this would ruin her reputation and that there were other lawyers working for her then 36 hours later she returned my phone call i just wanted to help paula i really think paula jones is a hero i dont think i could have taken the abuse she came under shes this poor little country girl and she has the most powerful man shes ever met hitting on her sexually then denying it and smearing her as president and she never did anything tacky its not like she was going on tv or trying to make a buck out of it15 in his book isikoff also reported coulter as saying we were terrified that jones would settle it was contrary to our purpose of bringing down the president126 after the book came out coulter clarified her stated motives saying the only motive for leaking the distinguishing characteristic item that isikoff gives in his book is my selfparodying remark that it would humiliate the president and that a settlement would foil our efforts to bring down the president i suppose you could take the position as isikoff does that we were working for jones because we thought clinton was a lecherous lying scumbag but this argument gets a bit circular you could also say that juanita broaddricks secret motive in accusing clinton of rape is that she hates clinton because he raped her the whole reason we didnt much like clinton was that we could see he was the sort of man who would haul a lowlevel government employee like paula to his hotel room drop his pants and say kiss it you know everything his defense said about him at the impeachment trial its not like we secretly disliked clinton because of his administrations position on californias citrus cartels or something and then set to work on some crazy scheme to destroy him using a pathological intern as our mata hari128 the case went to court after jones broke with coulter and her original legal team and it was dismissed via summary judgment the judge ruled that even if her allegations proved true jones did not show that she had suffered any damages stating plaintiff has not demonstrated any tangible job detriment or adverse employment action for her refusal to submit to the governors alleged advances the president is therefore entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs claim of quid pro quo sexual harassment the ruling was appealed by jones lawyers during the pendency of the appeal clinton settled with jones for 850000 151000 after legal fees in november 1998 in exchange for jones dismissal of the appeal by then the jones lawsuit had given way to the monica lewinsky sex scandal in october 2000 jones revealed that she would pose for nude pictures in an adult magazine saying she wanted to use the money to pay taxes and support her gradeschoolaged children in particular saying im wanting to put them through college and maybe set up a college fund129 coulter publicly denounced jones calling her the trailerpark trash they said she was coulter had earlier chastened clinton supporters for calling jones this name130 after clintons former campaign strategist james carville had made the widely reported remark drag a 100 bill through a trailer park and youll never know what youll find and called jones a fraud at least to the extent of pretending to be an honorable and moral person129 coulter wrote paula surely was given more than a million dollars in free legal assistance from an array of legal talent she will never again encounter in her life much less have busily working on her behalf some of those lawyers never asked for or received a dime for hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal work performed at great professional financial and personal cost to themselves others got partial payments out of the settlement but at least they got her reputation back and now shes thrown it away131 jones claimed not to have been offered any help with a book deal of her own or any other additional financial help after the lawsuit129 2008 presidential election as the 2008 presidential campaign was getting under way coulter drew criticism for statements she made at the 2007 conservative political action conference about presidential candidate john edwards132133 i was going to have a few comments on the other democratic presidential candidate john edwards but it turns out that you have to go into rehab if you use the word faggot so im so kind of at an impasse cant really talk about edwards so i think ill just conclude here and take your questions the comment was in reference to greys anatomy star isaiah washingtons use of the epithet and his subsequent mandatory psychological assessment imposed by abc executives134 it was widely interpreted as meaning that coulter had called edwards a faggot but coulter argued that she did not actually do so while simultaneously indicating she would not have been wrong to say it135 edwards responded on his web site by characterizing coulters words as unamerican and indefensible and asking readers to help him raise 100000 in coulter cash this week to keep this campaign charging ahead and fight back against the politics of bigotry136 he also called her a shedevil adding i should not have namecalled but the truth is—forget the names—people like ann coulter they engage in hateful language137 coulters words also drew condemnation from many prominent republicans and democrats as well as groups such as the gay and lesbian alliance against defamation glaad136138139 three advertisers verizon sallie mae and netbank also pulled their advertisements from coulters web site140 and several newspapers dropped her column141142 coulter responded in an email to the new york times c’mon it was a joke i would never insult gays by suggesting that they are like john edwards that would be mean139 on march 5 2007 she appeared on hannity and colmes and said faggot isnt offensive to gays it has nothing to do with gays its a schoolyard taunt meaning wuss143 gay rights advocates were not convinced ann coulters use of this antigay slur is vile and unacceptable said neil g giuliano president of the gay lesbian alliance against defamation and the applause from her audience is an important reminder that coulters ugly brand of bigotry is at the root of the discriminatory policies being promoted at this gathering133 a spokesman for sen john mccain a republican presidential candidate called coulters comments wildly inappropriate133 as the campaign waged on she continued to insert her commentary regarding the candidates both democrats and republicans in a june 2007 interview coulter named duncan hunter as her choice for the 2008 republican presidential nomination highlighting his views on immigration and specifically his antiabortion credentials saying this is a winning issue for us protecting little babies144 on january 16 2008 coulter began endorsing governor mitt romney as her choice for the 2008 republican nomination saying he is manifestly the best candidate contrasting romney with republican candidates john mccain mike huckabee and rudy giuliani145 by contrast coulter was critical of eventual republican nominee john mccain on the january 31 2008 broadcast of hannity and colmes coulter claimed that if mccain won the republican nomination for president she would support and campaign for hillary clinton stating clinton is more conservative than mccain146 regarding thenpresidentialcandidate barack obama in an april 2 2008 column she characterized his book dreams from my father as a dimestore mein kampf coulter writes he says the reason black people keep to themselves is that its easier than spending all your time mad or trying to guess whatever it was that white folks were thinking about you heres a little inside scoop about white people were not thinking about you especially wasps we think everybody is inferior and we are perfectly charming about it147 2010 canadian university tour ann coulter at cpac in february 2012 in march 2010 coulter announced that she would be embarking on a speaking tour of three canadian universities the university of western ontario the university of ottawa and the university of calgary the tour was organized by the international free press society148 on the eve of coulters first speech at the university of western ontario an email to coulter from françois houle provost of the university of ottawa was leaked to the media the email warned that promoting hatred against any identifiable group would not only be considered inappropriate but could in fact lead to criminal charges coulter released a public statement alleging that by sending her the email houle was promoting hatred against conservatives149 during her speech at the university of western ontario she told a muslim student to take a camel in response to the students question about previous comments by coulter that muslims should not be allowed on airplanes150 on march 22 the university of ottawa made international news when liberal protesters conspired to prevent coulter from speaking the event was canceled in spite of a massive security presence alain boucher of the ottawa police service said there were ten officers visible at the scene plus other resources nearby151 boucher alleged that coulters security team decided to call off the event saying we gave her options including he said to find a bigger venue but they opted to cancel its not up to the ottawa police to make that decision152 boucher claimed there were no arrests153 ctv news reported it was a disaster in terms of just organization which is probably one of the reasons why it was cancelled citing the small number of students tasked with confirming who had signed up to attend coulters talk154 event organizer and conservative activist ezra levant blamed the protest on the letter sent to coulter by houle155 after the cancellation coulter called the university of ottawa bush league stating156 i go to the best schools harvard the ivy league and those kids are too intellectually proud to threaten speakers i would like to know when this sort of violence this sort of protest has been inflicted upon a muslim—who appear to be from what i’ve read of the human rights complaints the only protected group in canada i think i’ll give my speech tomorrow night in a burka that will protect me comments on islam arabs and terrorism on september 14 2001 three days after the september 11 attacks in which her friend barbara olson had been killed coulter wrote in her column airports scrupulously apply the same laughably ineffective airport harassment to suzy chapstick as to muslim hijackers it is preposterous to assume every passenger is a potential crazed homicidal maniac we know who the homicidal maniacs are they are the ones cheering and dancing right now we should invade their countries kill their leaders and convert them to christianity we werent punctilious about locating and punishing only hitler and his top officers we carpetbombed german cities we killed civilians thats war and this is war157 this comment resulted in coulters being fired as a columnist by the national review which she subsequently referred to as squeamish girlyboys158 responding to this comment ibrahim hooper of the council on americanislamic relations remarked in the chicago sun times that before september 11 coulter would have faced swift repudiation from her colleagues but now its accepted as legitimate commentary159 david horowitz however saw coulters words as irony i began running coulter columns on frontpagemagcom shortly after she came up with her most infamous line which urged america to put jihadists to the sword and convert them to christianity liberals were horrified i was not i thought to myself this is a perfect sendup of what our islamofascist enemies believe—that as infidels we should be put to the sword and converted to islam i regarded coulter’s phillipic sic as a swiftian commentary on liberal illusions of multicultural outreach to people who want to rip out our hearts160 one day after the attacks when death toll estimates were higher than later coulter asserted that only muslims could have been behind the attacks not all muslims may be terrorists but all terrorists are muslims—at least all terrorists capable of assembling a murderous plot against america that leaves 7000 people dead in under two hours161 coulter has been highly critical of the us department of transportation and especially its thensecretary norman mineta her many criticisms include their refusal to use racial profiling as a component of airport screening162 after a group of muslims was expelled from a us airways flight when other passengers expressed concern sparking a call for muslims to boycott the airline because of the ejection from a flight of six imams coulter wrote if only we could get muslims to boycott all airlines we could dispense with airport security altogether163 coulter also cited the 2002 senate testimony of fbi whistleblower coleen rowley who was acclaimed for condemning her superiors for refusing to authorize a search warrant for 911 conspirator zacarias moussaoui when he refused to consent to a search of his computer they knew that he was a muslim in flight school who had overstayed his visa and the french intelligence service had confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist islamic groups coulter said she agreed that probable cause existed in the case but that refusing consent being in flight school and overstaying a visa should not constitute grounds for a search citing a poll which found that 98 percent of muslims between the ages of 20 and 45 said they would not fight for britain in the war in afghanistan and that 48 percent said they would fight for osama bin laden she asserted any muslim who has attended a mosque in europe—certainly in england where moussaoui lived—has had affiliations with radical fundamentalist islamic groups so that she parsed rowleys position as meaning that probable cause existed to search moussaouis computer because he was a muslim who had lived in england coulter says the poll was by the daily telegraph actually it was by sunrise an asian ie indian subcontinentoriented radio station canvassing the opinions of 500 muslims in greater london not britain as a whole mainly of pakistani origin and aged between 20 and 45 because fbi headquarters refused to engage in racial profiling they failed to uncover the 911 plot coulter asserted the fbi allowed thousands of americans to be slaughtered on the altar of political correctness what more do liberals want164 coulter wrote in another column that she had reviewed the civil rights lawsuits against certain airlines to determine which of them had subjected arabs to the most egregious discrimination so that she could fly only that airline she also said that the airline should be bragging instead of denying any of the charges of discrimination brought against them165 in an interview with the guardian she said i think airlines ought to start advertising we have the most civil rights lawsuits brought against us by arabs when the interviewer replied by asking what muslims would do for travel she responded they could use flying carpets123 one comment that drew criticism from the blogosphere as well as fellow conservatives166 was made during a speech at the conservative political action conference in february 2006 where she said referring to the prospect of a nuclearequipped iran what if they start having one of these bipolar episodes with nuclear weapons i think our motto should be post911 raghead talks tough raghead faces consequences167 coulter had previously written a nearly identical passage in her syndicated column i believe our motto should be after 911 jihad monkey talks tough jihad monkey takes the consequences sorry i realize thats offensive how about camel jockey what now whatd i say boy you tent merchants sure are touchy grow up would you168 in october 2007 coulter made further controversial remarks regarding arabs—in this case iraqis—when she stated in an interview with the new york observer weve killed about 20000 of them of terrorists of militants of al qaeda members and they’ve gotten a little over 3000 of ours that is where the war is being fought in iraq that is where we are fighting al qaeda sorry we have to use your country iraqis but you let saddam come to power and we are going to instill democracy in your country169 in a may 2007 article looking back at the life of recently deceased evangelical reverend jerry falwell coulter commented on his later retracted statement after the 911 attacks that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle the aclu people for the american way all of them who have tried to secularize america helped this happen in her article coulter stated that she disagreed with falwells statement because falwell neglected to specifically include teddy kennedy and the reverend barry lynn170 in october 2007 coulter participated in david horowitz islamofascism awareness week remarking in a speech at the university of southern california the fact of islamofascism is indisputable i find it tedious to detail the savagery of the enemy i want to kill them why dont democrats171 in the wake of the boston marathon bombings coulter told hannity host sean hannity that the wife of bombing suspect tamerlan tsarnaev should be jailed for wearing a hijab coulter continued by saying assimilating immigrants into our culture isn’t really working they’re assimilating us into their culture172 in the wake of the charlie hebdo shooting in paris coulter said france “needs to move to the next step” in dealing with terror coulter said of some immigrants they don’t want to live in muslim countries and yet they want to change the nonmuslim countries they move to into muslim countries it may be a small minority of muslims “and still it’s enough of them that maybe you take a little pause in muslim immigration for a while”173 coulter has attributed american gun violence in america to black and muslim american men stating that the epidemic of gunrelated deaths is not a gun problem its a demographic problem174 when asked about the financial crisis in the 2000s coulter claimed one reason for it was that they gave your mortgage to a less qualified minority175 ionizing radiation as cancer vaccine on march 16 2011 discussing the fukushima i nuclear accidents coulter citing research into radiation hormesis wrote that there was burgeoning evidence that excess radiation operates as a sort of cancer vaccine176 her comments were criticized by figures across the political spectrum from fox news bill oreilly who told coulter you have to be responsible in something like this you gotta get the folks out of there and you have to report worstcase scenarios177 to msnbcs ed schulz who stated that you would laugh at her if she wasnt making light of a terrible tragedy178 2012 presidential election during the republican party presidential primaries she supported mitt romney over former speaker of the house newt gingrich on an interview during the oreilly factor on fox news she compared newt gingrichs attacks on the media to jesse jackson accusing people of racism179 on her website she posted a column titled reelect obama vote newt arguing that if newt gingrich won the republican nomination barack obama would win reelection180 when asked to respond about her criticism newt gingrich dismissed them as the old order and cited recent polls showing him ahead of mitt romney181 on october 22 2012 following a presidential debate between mitt romney and barack obama coulter published the following tweet from her official twitter account i highly approve of romneys decision to be kind and gentle to the retard drawing stiff criticism for her use of a word which some find offensive to describe the president of the united states the special olympics condemned coulter in a tweet shortly after coulters182 on the alan colmes show coulter stated that she does not regret her use of the word saying retard had been used colloquially to just mean loser for 30 years but no these aggressive victims have to come out and tell you what words to use183 after the election in which barack obama won ann coulter wrote a column titled romney was not the problem in it she argued against the idea that mitt romney lost because he failed to get his message across she also said that mitt romney lost because he was running against an incumbent184 2013 cpac conference in march 2013 coulter was one of the keynote speakers at the conservative political action conference where she made references to new jersey governor chris christies weight cpac had to cut back on its speakers this year about 300 pounds and progressive activist sandra flukes hairdo coulter quipped that fluke didnt need birth control pills because that haircut is birth control enough coulter advocated against a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants because such new citizens would never vote for republican candidates if amnesty goes through america becomes california and no republican will ever win another election185186 2016 presidential election in the summer of 2015 coulter appeared on real time with bill maher and predicted that of all the declared republican primary candidates donald trump had the best chance of winning the general election prompting the studio audience to laugh in disbelief187 coulter later endorsed donald trump in the general election which he went on to win188 vdare coulter has been a contributor to vdare since 2006189 vdare is a right wing website and blog founded by antiimmigration activist and paleoconservative peter brimelow190 vdare is considered controversial because of its alleged ties to white supremacist rhetoric and support of scientific racism and white nationalism191 berkeley invitation and cancellation this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it april 2017 main article 2017 berkeley protests § april 27 in april 2017 the new york times reported that the university of california berkeley had cancelled ann coulters speech scheduled for april 27192 a university spokesman said they had not discussed a specific date with her and only learned about it by reading news reports193 the university administrators cited threats of violence and offered to accommodate her on a later date coulter said she saw no way forward telling the new york times its a sad day for free speech194 both bernie sanders and elizabeth warren publicly called for the university to defend her right to free speech194 coulter was reportedly invited by uc berkeley student organization berkeley patriot to participate in an event headed by milo yiannopoulos scheduled for september 2427 coulter never promoted her participation and after the event was cancelled noted that her speakers bureau agency had never contracted for her to appear at the event195196 plagiarism accusations in october 2001 coulter was accused of plagiarism in her 1998 book high crimes and misdemeanors by michael chapman a columnist for the journal human events who claims that passages were taken from a supplement he wrote for the journal in 1997 titled a case for impeachment158 on the july 5 2016 episode of countdown with keith olbermann guest john barrie the ceo of iparadigms offers his professional opinion that coulter plagiarized in her book godless as well as in many columns over the past year197 barrie ran godless through ithenticate his companys machine which is able to scan works and compare them to existing texts he points to a 25 word section of the text that exactly matches a planned parenthood pamphlet and a 33 word section almost duplicating a 1999 article from the portland press as some examples of evidence media matters for america has appealed to random house publishing to further investigate coulters work198 the syndicator of her columns cleared her of the plagiarism charges199 universal press syndicate and crown books also defended coulter against the charges200 columnist bill nemitz from the portland press herald accused coulter of plagiarizing a very specific sentence from his newspaper in her book godless but he also acknowledged that one sentence is insufficient grounds for filing suit201 public perception general sometimes referred to as an internet queen202 coulters has a high public profile203 gendered criticism known for rejecting the academic convention of euphemism and circumlocution204 coulter has been subject to a fair amount of criticism from scholars feminist critics have criticized the way that coulter functions as a thin blonde heterosexual woman in the republican party who prefers mini skirts and heels over a business suit the argument here is that coulter plays to misogyny in order to further her goals she dominates without threatening at least not straight men205 these critics also reject coulters opinion that the gains made by women have gone so far as to create an antimale society206 and her call for women to be rejected from the military because they are more vicious than men207 like the famous antifeminist phyllis schlafly coulter uses traditionally masculine rhetoric as reasoning for the need for traditional gender roles and she carries this idea of feminized dependency into her governmental policies according to feminist critics208 2016 comedy central roast in september 2016 coulter was invited to participate in a roast of rob lowe on comedy central as coulter is often considered a successful satirist209 there is speculation that coulter attended with the primary goal of promoting her newest book at the time in trump we trust but she ended up becoming the main target of the vitriol and the roast subsequently went viral coulter herself refers to the roast as the ann coulter roast with rob lowe210 bibliography coulter ann h 1998 high crimes
