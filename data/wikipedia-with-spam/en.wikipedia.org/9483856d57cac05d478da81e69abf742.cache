paula holds the bible upon which he was sworn in while president nixon looks on kissinger served as national security advisor and secretary of state under president richard nixon and continued as secretary of state under nixons successor gerald ford28 on nixons last full day in office in the meeting where he informed ford of his intention to resign the next day he advised ford that he felt it was very important that he keep kissinger in his new administration to which ford agreed29 a proponent of realpolitik kissinger played a dominant role in united states foreign policy between 1969 and 1977 in that period he extended the policy of détente this policy led to a significant relaxation in us–soviet tensions and played a crucial role in 1971 talks with chinese premier zhou enlai the talks concluded with a rapprochement between the united states and the peoples republic of china and the formation of a new strategic antisoviet sinoamerican alignment he was jointly awarded the 1973 nobel peace prize with lê đức thọ for helping to establish a ceasefire and us withdrawal from vietnam the ceasefire however was not durable30 thọ declined to accept the award31 and kissinger appeared deeply ambivalent about it donating his prize money to charity not attending the award ceremony and later offering to return his prize medal40 as national security advisor in 1974 kissinger directed the muchdebated national security study memorandum 200 détente and the opening to chinaedit see also on china as national security advisor under nixon kissinger pioneered the policy of détente with the soviet union seeking a relaxation in tensions between the two superpowers as a part of this strategy he negotiated the strategic arms limitation talks culminating in the salt i treaty and the antiballistic missile treaty with leonid brezhnev general secretary of the soviet communist party negotiations about strategic disarmament were originally supposed to start under the johnson administration but were postponed in protest upon the invasion by warsaw pact troops of czechoslovakia in august 1968 kissinger shown here with zhou enlai and mao zedong negotiated rapprochement with the peoples republic of china kissinger sought to place diplomatic pressure on the soviet union he made two trips to the peoples republic of china in july and october 1971 the first of which was made in secret to confer with premier zhou enlai then in charge of chinese foreign policy32 according to kissingers book the white house years and on china the first secret china trip was arranged through pakistani and romanian33 diplomatic and presidential involvement as there were no direct communication channels between the states his trips paved the way for the groundbreaking 1972 summit between nixon zhou and communist party of china chairman mao zedong as well as the formalization of relations between the two countries ending 23 years of diplomatic isolation and mutual hostility the result was the formation of a tacit strategic antisoviet alliance between china and the united states while kissingers diplomacy led to economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides and the establishment of liaison offices in the chinese and american capitals with serious implications for indochinese matters full normalization of relations with the peoples republic of china would not occur until 1979 because the watergate scandal overshadowed the latter years of the nixon presidency and because the united states continued to recognize the government of taiwan in september 1989 the wall street journals john fialka disclosed that kissinger took a direct economic interest in uschina relations in march 1989 with the establishment of china ventures inc a delaware limited partnership of which he was chairman of the board and chief executive officer a us75 million investment in a joint venture with the communist party governments primary commercial vehicle at the time china international trust investment corporation citic was its purpose board members were major clients of kissinger associates kissinger was criticised for not disclosing his role in the venture when called upon by abcs peter jennings to comment the morning after the june 4 1989 tiananmen crackdown kissingers position was generally supportive of deng xiaopings clearance of the square and he opposed economic sanctions34 vietnam waredit main article vietnam war see also cambodian civil war and laotian civil war kissinger with president richard nixon discussing vietnam situation in camp david 1972 kissingers involvement in indochina started prior to his appointment as national security adviser to nixon while still at harvard he had worked as a consultant on foreign policy to both the white house and state department kissinger says that in august 1965  henry cabot lodge jr an old friend serving as ambassador to saigon had asked me to visit vietnam as his consultant i toured vietnam first for two weeks in october and november 1965 again for about ten days in july 1966 and a third time for a few days in october 1966  lodge gave me a free hand to look into any subject of my choice he became convinced of the meaninglessness of military victories in vietnam  unless they brought about a political reality that could survive our ultimate withdrawal35 in a 1967 peace initiative he would mediate between washington and hanoi nixon had been elected in 1968 on the promise of achieving peace with honor and ending the vietnam war in office and assisted by kissinger nixon implemented a policy of vietnamization that aimed to gradually withdraw us troops while expanding the combat role of the south vietnamese army so that it would be capable of independently defending its government against the national front for the liberation of south vietnam a communist guerrilla organization and north vietnamese army vietnam peoples army or pavn kissinger played a key role in bombing cambodia to disrupt pavn and viet cong units launching raids into south vietnam from within cambodias borders and resupplying their forces by using the ho chi minh trail and other routes as well as the 1970 cambodian incursion and subsequent widespread bombing of khmer rouge targets in cambodia the bombing campaign contributed to the chaos of the cambodian civil war which saw the forces of leader lon nol unable to retain foreign support to combat the growing khmer rouge insurgency that would overthrow him in 19753637 documents uncovered from the soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the north vietnamese invasion of cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the khmer rouge and negotiated by pol pots then second in command nuon chea38 the american bombing of cambodia resulted in 400003915000040 deaths from 1969 to 1973 including at least 5000 civilians41 kissinger himself said there were about 50000 civilian casualties in the bombing42 pol pot biographer david p chandler argues that the bombing had the effect the americans wanted—it broke the communist encirclement of phnom penh43 however ben kiernan and taylor owen suggest that the bombs drove ordinary cambodians into the arms of the khmer rouge a group that seemed initially to have slim prospects of revolutionary success44 along with north vietnamese politburo member le duc tho kissinger was awarded the nobel peace prize on december 10 1973 for their work in negotiating the ceasefires contained in the paris peace accords on ending the war and restoring peace in vietnam signed the previous january30 according to irwin abrams this prize was the most controversial to date for the first time in the history of the peace prize two members left the nobel committee in protest245 tho rejected the award telling kissinger that peace had not been restored in south vietnam46 kissinger wrote to the nobel committee that he accepted the award with humility4748 and donated the entire proceeds to the children of american servicemembers killed or missing in action in indochina3 after the fall of saigon in 1975 kissinger attempted to return the award34 bangladesh waredit further information bangladesh liberation war 1971 bangladesh genocide and indopakistani war of 1971 under kissingers guidance the united states government supported pakistan in the bangladesh liberation war in 1971 kissinger was particularly concerned about the expansion of soviet influence in south asia as a result of a treaty of friendship recently signed by india and the ussr and sought to demonstrate to the peoples republic of china pakistans ally and an enemy of both india and the ussr the value of a tacit alliance with the united states495051 kissinger sneered at people who bleed for the dying bengalis and ignored the first telegram from the united states consul general in east pakistan archer k blood and 20 members of his staff which informed the us that their allies west pakistan were undertaking in bloods words a selective genocide52 in the second more famous blood telegram the word genocide was again used to describe the events and further that with its continuing support for west pakistan the us government had evidenced moral bankruptcy53 as a direct response to the dissent against us policy kissinger and nixon ended archer bloods tenure as united states consul general in east pakistan and put him to work in the state departments personnel office5455 henry kissinger had also come under fire for private comments he made to nixon during the bangladesh–pakistan war in which he described indian prime minister indira gandhi as a bitch and a witch he also said the indians are bastards shortly before the war56 kissinger has since expressed his regret over the comments57 israeli policy and soviet jewryedit according to notes taken by h r haldeman nixon ordered his aides to exclude all jewishamericans from policymaking on israel including kissinger58 one note quotes nixon as saying get k kissinger out of the play—haig handle it58 in 1973 kissinger did not feel that pressing the soviet union concerning the plight of jews being persecuted there was in the interest of us foreign policy in conversation with nixon shortly after a meeting with israeli prime minister golda meir on march 1 1973 kissinger stated the emigration of jews from the soviet union is not an objective of american foreign policy and if they put jews into gas chambers in the soviet union it is not an american concern maybe a humanitarian concern59 kissinger argued however that emigration existed at all was due to the actions of realists in the white house jewish emigration rose from 700 a year in 1969 to near 40000 in 1972 the total in nixons first term was more than 100000 to maintain this flow by quiet diplomacy we never used these figures for political purposes  the issue became public because of the success of our middle east policy when egypt evicted soviet advisers to restore its relations with cairo the soviet union put a tax on jewish emigration there was no jackson–vanik amendment until there was a successful emigration effort sen henry jackson for whom i had and continue to have high regard sought to remove the tax with his amendment we thought the continuation of our previous approach of quiet diplomacy was the wiser course  events proved our judgment correct jewish emigration fell to about a third of its previous high60 1973 yom kippur waredit documents show that kissinger delayed telling president richard nixon about the start of the yom kippur war in 1973 to keep him from interfering on october 6 1973 the israelis informed kissinger about the attack at 6 am kissinger waited nearly 3 and a half hours before he informed nixon61 on october 31 1973 egyptian foreign minister ismail fahmi left meets with richard nixon middle and henry kissinger right about a week after the end of fighting in the yom kippur war according to kissinger in an interview in november 2013 he was notified at 630 am 1230 pm israel time that war was imminent and his urgent calls to the soviets and egyptians were ineffective he says golda meirs decision not to preempt was wise and reasonable balancing the risk of israel looking like the aggressor and israels actual ability to strike within such a brief span of time62 the war began on october 6 1973 when egypt and syria attacked israel kissinger published lengthy telephone transcripts from this period in the 2002 book crisis on october 12 under nixons direction and against kissingers initial advice63 while kissinger was on his way to moscow to discuss conditions for a ceasefire nixon sent a message to brezhnev giving kissinger full negotiating authority62 israel regained the territory it lost in the early fighting and gained new territories from syria and egypt including land in syria east of the previously captured golan heights and additionally on the western bank of the suez canal although they did lose some territory on the eastern side of the suez canal that had been in israeli hands since the end of the six day war kissinger pressured the israelis to cede some of the newly captured land back to its arab neighbors contributing to the first phases of israeliegyptian nonaggression the move saw a warming in us–egyptian relations bitter since the 1950s as the country moved away from its former independent stance and into a close partnership with the united states the peace was finalized in 1978 when us president jimmy carter mediated the camp david accords during which israel returned the sinai peninsula in exchange for an egyptian peace agreement that included the recognition of the state of israel turkish invasion of cyprusedit see also turkish invasion of cyprus following a period of steady relations between the us government and the greek military regime after 1967 secretary of state kissinger was faced with the coup by the greek junta and the turkish invasion of cyprus in july and august 1974 in an august 1974 edition of the new york times it was revealed that kissinger and state department were informed in advance οf the impending coup by the greek junta in cyprus indeed according to the journalist64 the official version of events as told by the state department was that it felt it had to warn the greek military regime not to carry out the coup the warning had been delivered by july 9 according to repeated assurances from its athens services that is the us embassy and the american ambassador henry j tasca himself ioannis zigdis then a greek mp for centre union and former minister stated in an athenian newspaper65 that the cyprus crisis will become kissingers watergate zigdis also stressed “not only did kissinger know about the coup for the overthrow of archbishop makarios before july 15th he also encouraged it if he did not instigate it” kissinger was a target of antiamerican sentiment which was a significant feature of greek public opinion at the time—particularly among young people—viewing the us role in cyprus as negative in a demonstration by students in heraklion crete6566 soon after the second phase of the turkish invasion in august 1974 slogans such as kissinger murderer americans get out no to partition and cyprus is no vietnam were heard some years later kissinger expressed the opinion that the cyprus issue was resolved in 197467 a position very similar to that held by turkish prime minister bulent ecevit who had ordered the invasion latin american policyedit see also latin america–united states relations ford and kissinger conversing on grounds of the white house august 1974 the united states continued to recognize and maintain relationships with nonleftwing governments democratic and authoritarian alike john f kennedys alliance for progress was ended in 1973 in 1974 negotiations about a new settlement over the panama canal started they eventually led to the torrijoscarter treaties and the handing over of the canal to panamanian control kissinger initially supported the normalization of united statescuba relations broken since 1961 all us–cuban trade was blocked in february 1962 a few weeks after the exclusion of cuba from the organization of american states because of us pressure however he quickly changed his mind and followed kennedys policy after the involvement of the cuban revolutionary armed forces in the independence struggles in angola and mozambique kissinger said that unless cuba withdrew its forces relations would not be normalized cuba refused intervention in chileedit main article united states intervention in chile § 1970 election chilean socialist party presidential candidate salvador allende was elected by a plurality of 362 percent in 1970 causing serious concern in washington dc due to his openly socialist and procuban politics the nixon administration with kissingers input authorized the central intelligence agency cia to encourage a military coup that would prevent allendes inauguration but the plan was not successful6869701157049571177 united stateschile relations remained frosty during salvador allendes tenure following the complete nationalization of the partially usowned copper mines and the chilean subsidiary of the usbased itt corporation as well as other chilean businesses the us claimed that the chilean government had greatly undervalued fair compensation for the nationalization by subtracting what it deemed excess profits therefore the us implemented economic sanctions against chile the cia also provided funding for the mass antigovernment strikes in 1972 and 1973 and extensive black propaganda in the newspaper el mercurio7093 the most expeditious way to prevent allende from assuming office was somehow to convince the chilean congress to confirm jorge alessandri as the winner of the election once elected by the congress alessandri—a party to the plot through intermediaries—was prepared to resign his presidency within a matter of days so that new elections could be held this first nonmilitary approach to stopping allende was called the track i approach68 the cias second approach the track ii approach was designed to encourage a military overthrow70 on september 11 1973 allende died during a military coup launched by army commanderinchief augusto pinochet who became president72 a document released by the cia in 2000 titled cia activities in chile revealed that the united states acting through the cia actively supported the military junta after the overthrow of allende and that it made many of pinochets officers into paid contacts of the cia or us military73 in 1976 orlando letelier a chilean opponent of the pinochet regime was assassinated in washington dc with a car bomb previously kissinger had helped secure his release from prison74 and had chosen to cancel a letter to chile warning them against carrying out any political assassinations75 the us ambassador to chile david h popper said that pinochet might take as an insult any inference that he was connected with assassination plots76 it has been confirmed that pinochet directly ordered the assassination77 this murder was part of operation condor a covert program of political repression and assassination carried out by southern cone nations that kissinger has been accused of being involved in678 on september 10 2001 the family of chilean general rené schneider filed a suit against kissinger accusing him of collaborating in arranging schneiders kidnapping which resulted in his death79 according to phone records kissinger claimed to have turned off the operation80 however the cia claimed that no such standdown order was ever received81 and he and nixon later joked that an incompetent cia had struggled to kill schneider8283 a subsequent congressional investigation found that the cia was not directly involved in schneiders death80 the case was later dismissed by a us district court citing separation of powers the decision to support a coup of the chilean government to prevent dr allende from coming to power and the means by which the united states government sought to effect that goal implicate policy makers in the murky realm of foreign affairs and national security best left to the political branches84 decades later the cia admitted its involvement in the kidnapping of general schneider but not his murder and subsequently paid the group responsible for his death 35000 to keep the prior contact secret maintain the goodwill of the group and for humanitarian reasons8586 argentinaedit kissinger took a similar line as he had toward chile when the argentinian military led by jorge videla toppled the elected government of isabel perón in 1976 with a process called the national reorganization process by the military with which they consolidated power launching brutal reprisals and disappearances against political opponents during a meeting with argentinian foreign minister césar augusto guzzetti kissinger assured him that the united states was an ally but urged him to get back to normal procedures quickly before the us congress reconvened and had a chance to consider sanctions8788 according to declassified state department files kissinger also attempted to thwart the carter administrations efforts to halt the mass killings by the 197683 military dictatorship89 rhodesiaedit in september 1976 kissinger was actively involved in negotiations regarding the rhodesian bush war kissinger along with south africas prime minister john vorster pressured rhodesian prime minister ian smith to hasten the transition to black majority rule in rhodesia with frelimo in control of mozambique and even south africa withdrawing its support rhodesias isolation was nearly complete according to smiths autobiography kissinger told smith of mrs kissingers admiration for him but smith stated that he thought kissinger was asking him to sign rhodesias death certificate kissinger bringing the weight of the united states and corralling other relevant parties to put pressure on rhodesia hastened the end of minorityrule90 east timoredit main article indonesian occupation of east timor the portuguese decolonization process brought us attention to the former portuguese colony of east timor which lies within the indonesian archipelago and declared its independence in 1975 indonesian president suharto was a strong us ally in southeast asia and began to mobilize the indonesian army preparing to annex the nascent state which had become increasingly dominated by the popular leftist fretilin party in december 1975 suharto discussed the invasion plans during a meeting with kissinger and president ford in the indonesian capital of jakarta both ford and kissinger made clear that us relations with indonesia would remain strong and that it would not object to the proposed annexation91 they only wanted it done fast and proposed that it be delayed until after they had returned to washington92 accordingly suharto delayed the operation for one day finally on december 7 indonesian forces invaded the former portuguese colony us arms sales to indonesia continued and suharto went ahead with the annexation plan according to ben kiernan the invasion and occupation resulted in the deaths of nearly a quarter of the timorese population from 1975 to 198193 cubaedit in february 1976 kissinger considered launching air strikes against ports and military installations in cuba as well as deploying marine battalions based at the us navy base at guantanamo bay in retaliation for cuban president fidel castros decision in late 1975 to send troops to angola to help the newly independent nation fend off attacks from south africa and rightwing guerrillas94 later rolesedit kissinger meeting with president ronald reagan in the white house family quarters 1981 kissinger left office when democrat jimmy carter defeated republican gerald ford in

after kissinger left office in 1977 he was offered an endowed chair at columbia university there was significant student opposition to the appointment which eventually became a subject of wide media

that end the four have created the nuclear security project to advance this agenda in 2010 the four were featured in a documentary film entitled nuclear tipping point the film is a visual and

foreign policyedit president barack obama discussing the new start treaty between the us and russia 2010 yugoslav warsedit in several articles of his and interviews that he gave during the yugoslav wars he criticized the united states policies in southeast europe among other things for the recognition of bosnia and herzegovina as a sovereign state which he described as a foolish act107 most importantly he dismissed the notion of serbs and croats for that part being aggressors or separatist saying that they cant be separating from something that has never existed108 in addition he repeatedly warned the west of inserting itself into a conflict that has its roots at least hundreds of years back in time and said that the west would do better if it allowed the serbs and croats to join their respective countries108 kissinger shared similarly critical views on western involvement in kosovo in particular he held a disparaging view of the rambouillet agreement the rambouillet text which called on serbia to admit nato troops throughout yugoslavia was a provocation an excuse to start bombing rambouillet is not a document that any serb could have accepted it was a terrible diplomatic document that should never have been presented in that form — henry kissinger daily telegraph june 28 1999 however as the serbs did not accept the rambouillet text and nato bombings started he opted for a continuation of the bombing as natos credibility was now at stake but dismissed the use of ground forces claiming that it was not worth it109 iraqedit kissinger speaking during gerald fords funeral in january 2007 in 2006 it was reported in the book state of denial by bob woodward that kissinger met regularly with president george w bush and vice president dick cheney to offer advice on the iraq war110 kissinger confirmed in recorded interviews with woodward111 that the advice was the same as he had given in a column in the washington post on august 12 2005 victory over the insurgency is the only meaningful exit strategy112 in an interview on the bbcs sunday am on november 19 2006 kissinger was asked whether there is any hope left for a clear military victory in iraq and responded if you mean by military victory an iraqi government that can be established and whose writ runs across the whole country that gets the civil war under control and sectarian violence under control in a time period that the political processes of the democracies will support i dont believe that is possible i think we have to redefine the course but i dont believe that the alternative is between military victory as it had been defined previously or total withdrawal113 in an april 3 2008 interview with peter robinson of the hoover institution kissinger reiterated that even though he supported the 2003 invasion of iraq114 he thought that the george w bush administration rested too much of its case for war on saddams supposed weapons of mass destruction robinson noted that kissinger had criticized the administration for invading with too few troops for disbanding the iraqi army and for mishandling relations with certain allies115 indiaedit kissinger said in april 2008 that india has parallel objectives to the united states and he called it an ally of the us115 chinaedit kissinger was present at the opening ceremony of the 2008 beijing summer olympics116 in 2011 kissinger published on china chronicling the evolution of sinoamerican relations and laying out the challenges to a partnership of genuine strategic trust between the us and china117 iranedit kissingers position on this issue of us–iran talks was reported by the tehran times to be that any direct talks between the us and iran on issues such as the nuclear dispute would be most likely to succeed if they first involved only diplomatic staff and progressed to the level of secretary of state before the heads of state meet118 in 2016 kissinger said i would not have made the agreement but we will not get a great deal out of ending it now and that the biggest challenge facing the middle east is the potential domination of the region by an iran that is both imperial and jihadist119a 2014 ukrainian crisisedit henry kissinger in 2016 on march 5 2014 the washington post published an oped piece by kissinger 11 days before the crimean referendum on whether autonomous republic of crimea should officially rejoin in ukraine or join neighboring russia121 in it he attempted to balance the ukrainian russian and western desires for a functional state he made four main points ukraine should have the right to choose freely its economic and political associations including with europe ukraine should not join nato a repetition of the position he took seven years before ukraine should be free to create any government compatible with the expressed will of its people wise ukrainian leaders would then opt for a policy of reconciliation between the various parts of their country he imagined an international position for ukraine like that of finland ukraine should maintain sovereignty over crimea kissinger also wrote the west speaks ukrainian the east speaks mostly russian any attempt by one wing of ukraine to dominate the other—as has been the pattern—would lead eventually to civil war or break up121 following the publication of his book titled world order kissinger participated in an interview with charlie rose and updated his position on ukraine which he sees as a possible geographical mediator between russia and the west122 in a question he posed to himself for illustration regarding reconceiving policy regarding ukraine kissinger stated if ukraine is considered an outpost then the situation is that its eastern border is the nato strategic line and nato will be within 200 miles 320 km of volgograd that will never be accepted by russia on the other hand if the russian western line is at the border of poland europe will be permanently disquieted the strategic objective should have been to see whether one can build ukraine as a bridge between east and west and whether one can do it as a kind of a joint effort123 in december 2016 kissinger advised then presidentelect donald trump to accept crimea as a part of russia in an attempt to secure a rapprochement between the united states and russia whose relations soured as a result of the crimean crisis124125 public perceptionedit at the height of kissingers prominence many commented on his wit in february 1972 at the washington press club annual congressional dinner kissinger mocked his reputation as a secret swinger126 the insight power is the ultimate aphrodisiac is widely attributed to him although kissinger was paraphrasing napoleon bonaparte127 some scholars have ranked kissinger as the most effective us secretary of state in the 50 years to 20159 a number of activists and human rights lawyers however have sought his prosecution for alleged war crimes6128 according to historian and kissinger biographer niall ferguson however accusing kissinger alone of war crimes requires a double standard because nearly all the secretaries of state  and nearly all the presidents have taken similar actions129 colin powell canadian prime minister justin trudeau secretary of state john kerry and kissinger in march 2016 kissinger was interviewed in back door channels the price of peace a documentary examining the underpinnings of the 1979 peace treaty between israel and egypt130 in the film kissinger revealed how close he felt the world came to nuclear war during the 1973 yom kippur war launched by egypt and syria against israel attempts have been made to attach liability to kissinger for injustices in american foreign policy during his tenure in government in september 2001 relatives and survivors of general rene schneider the former head of the chilean general staff commenced civil proceedings in federal court in washington dc and in april 2002 a petition for kissingers arrest was filed in the high court in london by human rights campaigner peter tatchell131 citing the destruction of civilian populations and the environment in indochina during the years 1969–75 both suits were determined to lack legal foundation and were dismissed before trial132 britishamerican journalist and author christopher hitchens authored the trial of henry kissinger in which hitchens calls for the prosecution of kissinger for war crimes for crimes against humanity and for offenses against common or customary or international law including conspiracy to commit murder kidnap and torture133134135136 critics on the right such as ray takeyh have faulted kissinger for his role in the nixon administrations opening to china and secret negotiations with north vietnam takeyh writes that while rapprochement with china was a worthy goal the nixon administration failed to achieve any meaningful concessions from chinese officials in return as china continued to support north vietnam and various revolutionary forces throughout the third world nor does there appear to be even a remote indirect connection between nixon and kissingers diplomacy and the communist leaderships decision after maos bloody rule to move away from a communist economy towards state capitalism on vietnam takeyh claims that kissingers negotiations with le duc tho were intended only to secure a decent interval between americas withdrawal and south vietnams collapse4 johannes kadura offers a more positive assessment of nixon and kissingers strategy arguing that the two men simultaneously maintained a plan a of further supporting saigon and a plan b of shielding washington should their maneuvers prove futile according to kadura the decent interval concept has been largely misrepresented in that nixon and kissinger sought to gain time make the north turn inward and create a perpetual equilibrium rather than acquiescing in the collapse of south vietnam but the strength of the antiwar movement and the sheer unpredictability of events in indochina compelled them to prepare for the possibility that south vietnam might collapse despite their best efforts kadura concludes without nixon kissinger and fords clever use of triangular diplomacy  the soviets and the chinese could have been tempted into a far more aggressive stance following the us defeat in indochina than actually occurred137 in 2011 chimerica media released an interviewbased documentary titled kissinger in which kissinger reflects on some of his most important and controversial decisions during his tenure as secretary of state138 kissingers record was brought up during the 2016 democratic party presidential primaries hillary clinton had cultivated a close relationship with kissinger describing him as a friend and a source of counsel139 during the democratic primary debates clinton touted140 kissingers praise for her record as secretary of state141 in response candidate bernie sanders issued a critique of kissingers foreign policy declaring i am proud to say that henry kissinger is not my friend i will not take advice from henry kissinger142 family and personal lifeedit henry and nancy kissinger at the metropolitan opera opening in 2008 kissinger married ann fleischer in 1949 they had two children elizabeth and david and divorced in 1964 ten years later he married nancy maginnes143 they now live in kent connecticut and in new york city kissingers son david kissinger served as an executive with nbcuniversal before becoming head of conaco conan obriens

associationsedit kissinger and le duc tho were jointly offered the 1973 nobel peace prize for their work on the paris peace accords which prompted the withdrawal of american forces from the vietnam
