nagrom washington from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search nagrom was a town in king county washington a logging company town nagrom was located in the green river watershed between kanaskat washington and lester washington the town was built by the morgan lumber company and named after elmer g morgan the company founder and owner nagrom is simply morgan spelled backward the site was chosen for its access to timber and suitability to build a sawmill and mill pond in 1910 morgan petitioned the northern pacific railway which operated the rail line out of puget sound and up over stampede pass to build a spur into the small town the railway balked but morgan persisted and eventually the railway relented the spur into town was built in 1911 a post office was established that same year along with a telephone and telegraph exchange between 1914 and 1918 flooding rivers and streams in the city of tacomas watershed which was located in and around the town of nagrom swept sewage and contaminated water from the company settlement into the citys water supply worries about a common health risk of the era typhoid caused health officials to instruct residents living down stream from company settlements like lester baldi and nagrom to boil their drinking water to reduce typhoid related illnesses1 from 1911 to 1924 the morgan lumber company continued to work the area for timber and to run the sawmill at nagrom in 192122 the population topped out for this town with an estimated 450 residents in 1924 however the company went out of business presumably due to a postworld war i fall in lumber prices logging continued but at a slower pace as trucks began replacing railroad in the logging industry the forest service began managing the forested land in the area in the 1930s with the help of the civilian conservation corps the city of tacoma acquired the water rights on the green river c 1910 in first half of the 1950s the citys utility arm todays tacoma public utilities began buying private land along the banks of the river between their intake at headworks washington just east of kanaskat washington eastwards to the railroad and logging town of lester washington beginning with the construction of howard hanson dam the city limited access between headworks and lester installing gates at various access points to the green river watershed in about 1967 the city purchased the entire townsite of lester washington from the northern pacific railway by 1984 most residents had moved out the rail line was mothballed by the nps corporate descendant the burlington northern railroad and all the former communities along the rail line had become ghost towns today there are no residents in nagrom2 geographyedit the town was located at
