transit developed an interlocal agreement with the city of seattle for the city to design and construct the transit line12 construction began in late april 201213 and the line was originally scheduled to open in 201557 there had been a debate on the exact routing of the first hill streetcar line a community group petitioned the city of seattle to run the streetcar down 12th avenue 2 blocks east of broadway the first hill improvement association however wanted the streetcar to run down boren avenue turn right on seneca street and back to broadway to bring it closer to the core of the neighborhood14 the city selected a route on broadway the line opened with a soft launch on january 23 2016 with 2 weeks of free rides until the grand opening on february 13 during the lunar new year

original fleet of streetcars used on the south lake union line vehicles serving the first hill streetcar line operate using the overhead wires for the outboundnorthbounduphill leg and under battery power for the inboundsouthbounddownhill leg of the route production fell behind schedule due to design safety as well as component supply issues and this delayed the lines opening8 until early 2016 the first hill streetcar line requires six streetcars five in normal operation and an additional operational spare for the initial segment of the initial six cars three were assembled at inekons facilities in the czech republic and the remaining three were assembled locally in seattle by pacifica marine all streetcars were delivered in 2015 and began testing the required 310 miles 500 km for

approved the locally preferred alternative for the center city connector via resolution 3152619 which will connect the first hill streetcar occidental street terminus to the south lake union line via dedicated streetcar lanes on 1st avenue the federal transit administration has since approved the city of seattle’s request for entry into project development20 broadway extensionedit the currently halted broadway streetcar project would have extended the first hill streetcar a halfmile farther north on capitol hill into the commercial core of broadway with two stops near harrison street and roy street at a cost of 28 million the project would have also included an extension of the protected bike lanes to roy street and improvements to the surrounding streetscape21 in december 2016 the project was placed on an indefinite hold after the city had completed design work to the 90 stage at a cost of 3 million dollars the planned extension was halted due to a lack of support from businesses for the design particularly a shortage of loading zones for delivery trucks and the financial plan which would involve taxing properties located along the alignment2223 see alsoedit south
