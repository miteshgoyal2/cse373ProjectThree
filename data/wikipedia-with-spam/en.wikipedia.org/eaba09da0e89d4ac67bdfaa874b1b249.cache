to a patented invention without permission from the patent holder permission may typically be granted in the form of a license the definition of patent infringement may vary by jurisdiction but it typically includes using or selling the patented invention in many countries a use is required to be commercial or to have a commercial purpose to constitute patent infringementcitation needed the scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection1 is defined in the claims of the granted patent in other words the terms of the claims inform the public of what is not allowed without the permission of the patent holder patents are territorial and infringement is only possible in a country where a patent is in force for example if a patent is granted in the united states then anyone in the united states is prohibited from making using selling or importing the patented item while people in other countries may be free to exploit the patented invention in their country the scope of protection may vary from country to country because the patent is examined or in some countries not substantively examined by the patent office in each country or region and may be subject to different patentability requirements contents 1 overview 11 indirect infringement 2 legislation 21 australia 22 canada 23 europe 24 japan 25 united kingdom 26 united states 3 clearance search and

reading overviewedit typically a party other than the patentee or licensee of the patentee that manufactures imports uses sells or offers for sale patented technology without permissionlicense from the patentee during the term of the patent and within the country that issued the patent is considered to infringe the patent2 the test varies from country to country but in general it requires that the infringing partys product or method service and so on falls within one or more of the claims of the patent the process employed involves reading a claim onto the technology of interest if all of the claims elements are found in the technology the claim is said to read on the technology if a single element from the claim is missing from the technology the claim does not literally read on the technology and the technology generally does not infringe the patent with respect to that claim except if the doctrine of equivalence is considered applicable in response to allegations of infringement an accused infringing party typically asserts one or more of the following that it was not practicing the patented invention ie the invention claimed in the patent the claims define the extent of protection conferred by a patent that it was not performing any infringing act in the territory covered by the patent patents are indeed territorial in nature that the patent has expired since patents have a limited patent term ie a limited lifetime that the patent or the particular claims alleged to be infringed is invalid because the invention in question does not meet the patentability requirements or includes a formal defect this rendering the patent invalid or unenforceable that it has obtained a license under the patent the parties may also resolve their dispute in a settlement which may involve a licensing agreement such as a crosslicensing agreement private settlements may not always serve the public interest because litigating patent disputes to completion tends to generate positive externalities by clarifying the limits of patent protection if the patent is upheld or encouraging wider use of the innovation if the patent is invalidated3 indirect infringementedit in certain jurisdictions there is a particular case of patent infringement called indirect infringement indirect infringement can occur for instance when a device is claimed in a patent and a third party supplies a product which can only be reasonably used to make the claimed device4 legislationedit australiaedit in australia a patent infringement occurs when a person who is not the patentee exploits or authorises another person to exploit the patent in question5 exploit in this context includes6 i make hire sell or otherwise dispose of a patented product or ii offer to make sell hire or otherwise dispose of a patented product or iii use or import a patented product or iv keep it for the purposes of doing i ii or iii or v use a patented method or process or vi do any act mentioned from i to iv above in respect of a product resulting from the use of a patented method or process canadaedit main article patent infringement in canadian law in canada patents are governed by the patent act and the rights of a patent holder are summarized at s 42 “ 42 every patent granted under this act shall contain the title or name of the invention with a reference to the specification and shall subject to this act grant to the patentee and the patentee’s legal representatives for the term of the patent from the granting of the patent the exclusive right privilege and liberty of making constructing using the invention and selling it to others to be used subject to adjudication in respect thereof before any court of competent jurisdiction7 ” by granting the patent holder the exclusive right privilege and liberty of making constructing using and selling the invention the act establishes that any other person making constructing using or selling the patented invention is infringing that patent whether there has been an infringement of a patent is usually a question of fact8 canada is considered to be more friendly for rights holders in pursuing patent claims than in the united states due to significant differences between the two jurisdictions9 patents in canada are subject to a purposive construction which relies on reading both the claims and the specifications to determine the scope of a patent and extrinsic evidence is not permitted leading to the absence of prosecution history estoppel10 while us patent trials are heard by a jury canadian trials are heard by a judge only and thus the claims of a canadian patent are construed only once as part of the trial judges decision on the merits of the case as a whole in that regard the federal court of appeal has ruled that markman hearings are not allowed under canadian law11 in canada the applicant has no obligation to disclose material prior art so patents cannot be invalidated on that basis12 the same absence of obligation also means that the competition act will not come into play unlike what occurs with antitrust law in the us13 the canadian discovery process is more streamlined than the us procedure resulting in less cost and time in pursuing the lawsuit and it also possesses an implied undertaking rule barring use of information produced or disclosed in discovery from any purpose other than the present litigation other than by leave of the court canadian law allows a plaintiff to elect to claim either compensatory damages or an accounting of profits which can either act as a deterrent on infringement or as an incentive to reach a settlement before trial the availability of costs in canadian courts is a significant advantage to a plaintiff confident of success but is also a deterrent to pursuing more speculative cases treble damages are not awarded in canadian courts and punitive damages are less likely to be awarded europeedit main articles enforcement of european patents and european patent law in europe patent infringement of both national patents and european patents are essentially dealt upon by national courts although european patents are granted by the european patent office these european patents lead are enforced at a national level ie on a percountry basis14 a majority of the member states of the european union have agreed to set up an unitary patent formerly called community patent system according to which patents would be centrally enforceable before a unified patent court however the corresponding legal texts have not entered into force yet japanedit main article japanese patent law infringement under the patent law in japan is defined by article 101 of patent act act no 121 of 195915 which shows the following acts shall be deemed to constitute infringement of a patent right or an exclusive license i where a patent has been granted for an invention of a product acts of producing assigning etc importing or offering for assignment etc any product to be used exclusively for the producing of the said product as a business ii where a patent has been granted for an invention of a product acts of producing assigning etc importing or offering for assignment etc any product excluding those widely distributed within japan to be used for the producing of the said product and indispensable for the resolution of the problem by the said invention as a business knowing that the said invention is a patented invention and the said product is used for the working of the invention iii where a patent has been granted for an invention of a process acts of producing assigning etc importing or offering for assignment etc any product to be used exclusively for the use of the said process as a business and iv where a patent has been granted for an invention of a process acts of producing assigning etc importing or offering for assignment etc any product excluding those widely distributed within japan to be used for the use of the said process and indispensable for the resolution of the problem by the said invention knowing that the said invention is a patented invention and the said product is used for the working of the invention as a business united kingdomedit main article patent infringement under united kingdom law infringement under united kingdom patent law is defined by section 60 of the uk patents act 1977 as amended which sets out the following types of infringement where the invention is a product by the making disposing of offering to dispose of using importing or keeping a patented product where the invention is a process by the use or offer for use where it is known that the use of the process would be an infringement also by the disposal of offer to dispose of use or import of a product obtained directly by means of that process or the keeping of any such product whether for disposal or otherwise by the supply or offer to supply in the united kingdom a person not entitled to work the invention with any of the means relating to an essential element of the invention for putting the invention into effect when it is known or it is reasonable to expect such knowledge that those means are suitable for putting and are intended to put the invention into effect in the united kingdom united statesedit main article patent infringement under united states law in united states law an infringement may occur where the defendant has made used sold offered to sell or imported an infringing invention or its equivalent16 one also commits indirect infringement if he actively and knowingly induces another to infringe and is liable for that infringement types of indirect infringement include contributory infringement and induced infringement no infringement action may be started until the patent is issued however pregrant protection is available under 35 usc § 154d which allows a patent owner to obtain reasonable royalty damages for certain infringing activities that occurred before patents date of issuance this right to obtain provisional damages requires a patent holder to show that 1 the infringing activities occurred after the publication of the patent application 2 the patented claims are substantially identical to the claims in the published application and 3 the infringer had actual notice of the published patent application in the us there are safe harbor provisions to use a patented invention for the purposes of gathering data for a regulatory submission17 clearance search and clearance validity and enforceability opinionsedit a clearance search also called freedomtooperate fto search or infringement search1819 is a search done on issued patents or on pending patent applications to determine if a product or process infringes any of the claims of the issued patents or pending patent applications a clearance search may also include expired art that acts as a safe harbor permitting the product or process to be used based on patents in the public domain these searches are often performed by one or more professional patent searchers who are under the direction of one or more patent attorneys a clearance search can be followed by a clearance opinion ie a legal opinion provided by one or more patent attorneys as to whether a given product or process infringes the claims of one or more issued patents or pending patent applications clearance opinions may be done in combination with a validity and enforceability opinion a validity and enforceability opinion is a legal opinion as to whether a given patent is valid andor enforceable in other words a validity opinion is a legal opinion or letter in which a patent attorney or patent agent analyzes an issued patent and provides an opinion on how a court might rule on its validity or enforceability20 validity opinions are often sought before litigation related to a patent the average cost of a validity opinion according to one 2007 survey is over 15000 with an infringement analysis adding 1300021 the cost of these opinions for us patents can run from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars or more depending upon the particular patent the number of defenses and prior art references the length of the prosecution file history and the complexity of the technology in question an exculpatory opinion setting forth reasons the patent is not infringed or providing other defenses such as prior use intervening rights or prior invention is also possible patent infringement insuranceedit patent infringement insurance is an insurance policy provided by one or more insurance companies to protect either an inventor or a third party from the risks of inadvertently infringing a patent for inventors patent infringement insurance covers legal costs in case they have to sue an infringer to enforce their patent for third parties patent infringement insurance covers their legal costs in case they are sued for patent infringement by an inventor patent infringement insurance is generally considered too expensive to be worth the cost the premiums must be high however due at least in part to the high legal costs of patent infringement cases a typical patent infringement case in the us costs 1 3 million dollars in legal fees for each side this is despite the fact that 99 of all patent infringement cases are settledcitation needed legal fees in pharmaceutical cases can run 30 million dollars or more although this should be contrasted with the fact that billions of dollars may be at stakecitation needed in june 2006 a study for the european commission on the feasibility of possible insurance schemes against patent litigation risks was published22 the report concluded that the continuation of the status quo with very little disproportionately expensive bespoke patent litigation insurance pli would not meet any objectives for a feasible insurance scheme instead only a mandatory scheme was considered to be viable in order to provide the economic and technical benefits to the eu and individual patentees which would arise from a widespread pli scheme piracyedit since the 1840s the expression patent pirate has been used as a pejorative term to describe those that infringe a patent and refuse to acknowledge the priority of the inventor samuel f b morse inventor of the telegraph for example complained in a letter to friend in 184823 i have been so constantly under the necessity of watching the movements of the most unprincipled set of pirates i have ever known that all my time has been occupied in defense in putting evidence into something like legal shape that i am the inventor of the electromagnetic telegraph would you have believed it ten years ago that a question could be raised on that subject those who accuse others of being patent pirates say that they take advantage of the high cost of enforcing a patent to willfully infringe valid patents with impunity knowing that the average small inventor does not have the financial resources required to enforce their patent rightscitation needed in the us for example an inventor must budget 1 million or more in order to initiate patent litigation they say that patent pirates also take advantage of countries where patent rights are difficult to enforce and willfully infringe in those countriescitation needed ironically the term pirate has also been used to describe patent owners that vigorously enforce their patents24 see also patent troll thus whether one deliberately infringes a patent or whether one vigorously enforces a patent they may be referred to as a pirate by those that feel they are overstepping their bounds threat to bring a patent infringement actionedit a threat to bring a patent infringement action is highly likely to influence the commercial conduct of the person threatened which is why the law of some countries including the uk provides that the making of a groundless threat to sue is within certain carefully prescribed limits an actionable wrong in itself25 this however is not the case in the united states see alsoedit licensing of patents overviews licensing royalties types compulsory licensing
