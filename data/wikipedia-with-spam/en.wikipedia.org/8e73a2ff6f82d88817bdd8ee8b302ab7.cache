reportsbroken section anchors for internal links which point to deleted or nonexistent articles see wpredlinks for other uses see wikipediaciting sources § preventing and repairing dead links wplr redirects here for lua requests see wikipedialua requests this help page is a howto guide it details processes or procedures of some aspect or aspects of wikipedias norms and practices it is not one of wikipedias policies or guidelines as it has not been thoroughly vetted by the community shortcuts wplr wp404 wprot this page in a nutshell link rot can kill poorly sourced citations but steps may be taken to reduce or repair its effect do not merely delete cited information solely because the url to the source does not work any longer like most large websites wikipedia suffers from the phenomenon known as link rot where external links often used as references and citations gradually become irrelevant or broken also called a dead link as the linked websites disappear change their content or move this presents a significant threat to wikipedias reliability policy and its source citation guideline the effort required to prevent link rot is significantly less than the effort required to repair or mitigate a rotten link therefore prevention of link rot strengthens the encyclopedia this guide provides strategies for preventing link rot before it happens these include the use of web archiving services and the judicious use of citation templates editors are encouraged to add an archive link as a part of each citation or at least submit the referenced url for archivingnote 1 at the same time that a citation is created or updated however link rot cannot always be prevented so this guide also explains how to mitigate link rot by finding previously archived links and other sources these strategies should be implemented in accordance with wikipediaciting sourcespreventing and repairing dead links which describes the steps to take when a link cannot be repaired except for urls in the external links section that have not been used to support any article content do not delete cited information solely because the url to the source does not work any longer recovery and repair options and tools are available verifiability does not require that all information be supported by a working link nor does it require the source to be published online

automated tools 6 link rot on nonwikimedia sites 7 see also 71 bots 8 external links 9 notes preventing link rot shortcut wpplrt as you write articles you can help prevent link rot in several ways the first way to prevent link rot is to avoid bare urls by recording as much of the exact title author publisher and date of the source as possible optionally also add the accessdate if the link goes bad this added information can help a future wikipedian either editor or reader locate a new source for the original text either online or a print copy this may be impossible with only an isolated bare url that no longer works local and school libraries are a good resource for locating such offline sources many local libraries have inhouse subscriptions to digital databases or interlibrary loan agreements making it easier to retrieve hardtofind sources as you edit if an article has bare urls in its citations fix them or at least tag the references section with linkrot as a reminder to complete citation details as above and to categorize the article as needing cleanup web archive services see also wikipedialist of web archives on wikipedia and wikipediaciting sourcesfurther considerations § preemptive archiving a second way to prevent link rot is to use a web archiving service the two most popular services are the wayback machine which crawls and archives many web pages as well as having a form to suggest a url to be archivednote 1 and webcite which provides ondemand web archiving these services collect and preserve web pages for future use even if the original web page is moved changed deleted or placed behind a pay wall web archiving is especially important when citing web pages that are unstable or prone to changes like time sensitive news articles or pages hosted by financially distressed organizations once you have the url for the archived version of the web page use the archiveurl and archivedate parameters in the citation template that you are using the template will automatically incorporate the archived link into reference dubner stephen j january 24 2008 wall street journal paywall sturdier than suspected the new york times company retrieved 20091028  dubner stephen j january 24 2008 wall street journal paywall sturdier than suspected the new york times company archived from the original on 20110815  however not every web page can be archived webmasters and publishers may use a robots exclusion standard in their domain to disallow archiving or rely on complicated javascript flash or other code that is not easily copied in these cases alternate methods of preserving the data may be available robotstxt a quirk in the way the wayback machine operates means archived copies of sites sometimes become unavailable for example the freakonomics blog previously hosted at freakonomicsblogsnytimescom those urls were later excluded from archiving by the new york times robotstxt file this also made the previously archived content unavailable robotstxt changes however can unhide that which previous changes have hidden so do not delete an archiveurl solely because the archived content is currently unavailable luckily in this case not only can the content be found on a new site that is still open to archiving but the sites robotstxt later changed to allow archiving again and so the old archives are now unhidden example alternative methods most citation templates have a quote parameter that can be used to store text quotes of the source material this can be used to store a limited amount of text from the source within the citation template this is especially useful for sources that cannot be archived with web archiving services it can also provide insurance against failure of the chosen web archiving service dubner stephen j january 24 2008 wall street journal paywall sturdier than suspected the new york times company archived from the original on 20080430 the wall street journal will not as has been widely speculated tear down its paywall entirely  when using the quote parameter choose the most succinct and relevant material possible that preserves the context of the reference storing the entire text of the source is not appropriate under fair use policies so choose only the most important portions of the text that most support the assertions in the wikipedia article a quote also helps searching for other online versions of the source in the event that the original is discontinued where applicable public domain materials can be copied to wikisource repairing a dead link shortcut wpdeadlink wpdeadlink redirects here for the related guideline see wpdeadref there are several ways to try to repair a dead link detailed below searching if the dead link includes enough information article title names etc it is often possible to use it to find the web page at a different location either on the same site or elsewhere search the site often web pages have simply moved either in connection with a migration to a new server or through general site maintenance a site index or sitespecific search feature is a useful place to locate the moved page if these tools are not available many internet search engines allow a search on a specified site search the internet a search engine query using the title of the page possibly with a search restriction to the same site might find the page using the examples from above a web search such as google yahoo etc might look like one of these sitefreakonomicsblogsnytimescom wall street journal paywall sturdier than suspected sitenytimescom wall street journal paywall sturdier than suspected wall street journal paywall sturdier than suspected also a search for some components of the dead link with punctuation removed is often fruitful eg a search through google for groupscsailmitedu sfft paper pdf leads to a page enabling this fix a search for an unusual or uniquelooking substring of the url such as just the filename at the end is often fruitful internet archives check for archived versions of the page in the archiving services if you find an archived version of the dead link doublecheck to make sure that citation still supports the article text it is also a good idea to consult the access date of the citation if it was specified or a history search for when it was added to see how contemporaneous this archived version is to the link when it was cited the following archiving services are considered to be reliable wayback machine at httpsarchiveorgweb webcite at httpswwwwebcitationorgquery uk government web archive at httpwebarchivenationalarchivesgovuk the mementos interface allows you to search multiple archiving services for archived versions of some pages with a single request using the memento protocol unfortunately the mementos webpage interface removes any parameters which are included with the url if the url contains a it is unlikely to work properly when entered manually without changes when entering the url into the mementos interface manually the most common change needed is to change to 3f while making only this change will not be sufficient in all cases it will work most of the time the bookmarklet in the table below will properly encode urls such that searches will work mementos looks like it is or at least will be very convenient however if archives are not found at mementos it should not be the only site checked mementos can sometimes return no results when archives exist at sites which it normally includes an example of this is trying to find archives of battle of the atlantic as of april 2014update archiveorg reports it has 63 or 64 archives https http mementos reports 0 archives https http mementos usually finds archives at archiveorg but sometimes mementos does not even when archives exist if you try mementos first dont assume that there really are no archives if mementos reports that there are none there are many internet archive projects in existence when multiple archive dates are available try to use the one that is most likely to be the contents of the page seen by the editor who entered the reference on the accessdate if that parameter is not specified a search of the articles revision history can be performed to determine when the link was added to the article view the archive to verify that it contains valid page information sometimes archives are actually archives of the fact that the link is dead or that the archiving failed if this is the case try using an archive from a different date usually dates closer to the time the link was placed in the wikipedia page or earlier are more likely to show valid information different archiving sites should also be tried if an archived version of a page is found for which the dead link supplied little information the additional information may be enough with a little extra work to find a live copy for example the archived version of a dead bare link may provide title and author allowing a live version to be found an actual example the dead link httpwwwvangoghmuseumnlvgmindexjsppage2122langen van gogh museum amsterdam leads to httpwaybackarchiveorgweb20140323172316httpwwwvangoghmuseumnlvgmindexjsppage2122langen which gives the title the courtesan after eisen 1887 a search on the wwwvangoghmuseumnl site finds a live link for most citation templates archives are entered using the required archiveurl archivedate and optional deadurl parameters the primary link is automatically switched to the archive unless deadurlno the deadurl parameter can simply be omitted to preemptively supply an archived version of a url that may later go dead deadurlyes or y or true will change the display order with the title retaining the original link and the archive linked at the end when the original url has been usurped for the purposes of spam advertising or is otherwise unsuitable setting deadurlunfit or deadurlusurped suppresses display of the original url but url is still required bookmarklets to check common archive sites for archives of the current page all open in a new tab or window archive site bookmarklet archiveorg

consider finding an alternate source so that the loss of the original does not harm the verifiability of the article alternate sources about broad topics are usually easily located a simple search engine query might locate an appropriate alternative but be extremely careful to avoid citing mirrors and forks of wikipedia itself which would violate wikipediaverifiability sometimes finding an appropriate source is not possible or would require more extensive research techniques such as a visit to a library or the use of a subscriptionbased database if that is the case consider consulting with wikipedia editors at wikipediawikiproject resource exchange the wikipediavillage pump or wikipediahelp desk also consider contacting experts or other interested editors at a relevant wikiproject keeping dead links shortcut wpkdl a dead unarchived source url may still be useful such a link indicates that information was probably verifiable in the past and the link might provide another user with greater resources or expertise with enough information to find the reference it could also return from the dead with a dead link it is possible to determine if it has been cited elsewhere or to contact the person originally responsible for the source for example one could contact the yale computer science department if httpwwwcsyaleedueliyaledefenseindepthphdthesispdfdead link were dead place dead link after the dead url and just before the ref tag if applicable leaving the original link intact placing dead link autocategorizes the article into articles with dead external links project category and into specific monthly date range category based on date parameter do not delete a url just because it has been tagged with dead link for a long time automated tools there have been at least 6 bots over the years that proactively and automatically archive external urls as of april 2017 two bots are operational the primary bot is internetarchivebot operator cyberpower678 which can also be run on individual pages by anyone click on a page history tab and find the link for fix dead links the other bot is waybackmedic operator green cardamom which primarily checks for link rot among the archive links themselves plus fixes various other problems related to archives linkchecker is an opensource tool that can scan for broken links on any website including wikipedia link rot on nonwikimedia sites shortcut wpexternalrot nonwikimedia sites are also susceptible to link rot following a page move or page deletion links to wikipedia pages from other websites may break in most page moves a redirect will remain at the old page—this wont cause a problem but if a page is completely deleted or usurped ie replaced with other content then link rot will have been caused on any external websites that link to it replacement of page content with a disambiguation page may still cause link rot but is less harmful because a disambiguation page is essentially a type of soft redirect that will lead the reader to the required content if a page is usurped with content for another subject that shares its name a hatnote may be placed at the top that directs readers to the original content on its new page—this again is a type of soft redirect but less obvious in these cases readers arriving from an external rotten link should be able to find what theyre looking for but the situation is best avoided as they would have to get there via an additional page potentially giving a poor impression of both wikipedia and the linking website because the wikipedia software does not store referer information it will be impossible to tell how many external web pages will be affected by a move or deletion but the risk of link rot will probably be greatest on older and higher profile pages in truth there is not a lot that can be done maintenance of nonwikimedia websites is not within the scope of being a wikimedian nor in most cases within our capability although if they can be fixed it would be helpful to do so however it may be good practice to think about the potential impact on other sites when deleting or moving wikipedia pages especially if no redirect or hatnote will remain if a move or deletion is expected to cause significant damage then this might be a factor to consider in wprm wpafd and wprfd discussions although other factors may carry more
