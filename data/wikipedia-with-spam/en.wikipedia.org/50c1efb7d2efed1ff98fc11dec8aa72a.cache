or simply bubblegum is a genre of pop rock music with an upbeat sound contrived and marketed to appeal to preteens and teenagers which may be produced in an assemblyline process driven by producers and often using unknown singers bubblegums classic period ran from 1967 to 19721 a second wave of bubblegum started two years later and ran until 1977 when disco took over and punk rock emerged the genre was predominantly a singles phenomenon rather than an albumoriented one because many acts were manufactured in the studio using session musicians a large number of bubblegum songs were by onehit wonders among the bestknown acts of bubblegums golden era are 1910 fruitgum company the ohio express and the archies2 an animated group which had the most successful bubblegum song with sugar sugar

1960s and 1970s 4 see also 5 references 6 external links characteristicsedit the chief characteristics of the genre are that it is pop music contrived and marketed to appeal to preteens and teenagers is produced in an assemblyline process is driven by producers often uses unknown singers and has an upbeat sound1 the songs typically have singalong choruses seemingly childlike themes and a contrived innocence occasionally combined with an undercurrent of sexual double entendre3 bubblegum songs are also defined as having a catchy melody simple chords simple harmonies dancy but not necessarily danceable beats repetitive riffs or hooks and a vocallymultiplied refrain the song lyrics often feature themes of romantic love and personal happiness with references to sunshine platonic love toys colors nonsense words etc they are also notable for their frequent reference to sugary food including sugar honey butterscotch jelly and marmalade crossmarketing with cereal and bubblegum manufacturers also strengthened the link between bubblegum songs and confectionery cardboard records by the archies the banana splits the jackson 5 the monkees bobby sherman josie and the pussycats hr pufnstuf and other acts were included on the backs of cereal boxes in the late 1960s and early 1970s while acts including the brady bunch had their own brands of chewing gum as a result of licensing deals with tv networks and record companies1 etymologyedit producers jerry kasenetz and jeff katz have claimed credit for coining the term bubblegum pop saying that when they discussed their target audience they decided it was teenagers the young kids and at the time we used to be chewing bubblegum and my partner and i used to look at it and laugh and say ah this is like bubblegum music the term was seized upon by buddah records label executive neil bogart music writer and bubblegum historian bill pitzonka confirmed the claim telling goldmine magazine thats when bubblegum crystallized into an actual camp kasenetz and katz really crystallized it when they came up with the term themselves and that nice little analogy and neil bogart being the marketing person he was just crammed it down the throats of people thats really the point at which bubblegum took off3 historyedit the birth of bubblegum is generally dated from the success in 1968 of the lemon pipers psychedelic bubblegum hit green tambourine 1910 fruitgum companys simon says and the ohio express yummy yummy yummy but music critics have identified novelty songs including the dixie cups iko iko and patti pages how much is that doggie in the window as possible precursors3 a breeding ground for the genre has also been found in the field of 1960s garage rock the songs of which shared an overriding simplicity with bubblegum garage and bubblegum groups were also both generally singles acts several garage punk bands including shadows of knight later recorded bubblegum tracks while ohio express one of the major 1960s bubblegum bands began their recording career with punkrooted tunes3 between those two camps emerged florida group the royal guardsmen who scored a us no 2 hit in 1966 with their novelty hit snoopy vs the red baron and the fifth estate whose 1967 song dingdong the witch is dead reached no 11 in the us3 tommy james and the shondells are also seen as a major influence with such songs as 1964s hanky panky 1966s its only love and 1967s i think were alone now and gettin together as is tommy roe with his 1966 hit sweet pea but critics are divided on one possible major bubblegum band prototype the monkees although the band began as a prefabricated fictional rock group concocted to sell records and tv advertising time the band later wrested creative control from their creators3 1960s and

expatriate suzi quatro these acts had great success in the uk asia europe and australia charting many singles they were less successful in the us however one english bubblegumpop singer who did
