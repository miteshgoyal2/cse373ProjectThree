was already in advanced stages in april 2011 when it was presented to the majority of the jackson family katherine jackson said michael gave his entire life to the world through his love his music and his devotion to healing the planet i am positive that this event will be an event great enough in scale talent and imagination to form a worthy celebration of michaels life3 production and broadcastersedit the concert was organised by global live events llp formed by film producers michael henry and ceo chris hunt and us ceo eric bute3 it was expected that the concert would be broadcast throughout the world to 30 countries in 2d and 3d formats however this was later cancelled due to copyright issues4 ticket pricing and ticket salesedit tickets were priced from £55 standard seats cost

reduced down from 75000 to 50000 with only 40000 tickets having been sold7 cardiff council also confirmed that some council staff and councillors were sent emails by the millennium stadium offering them a number of free tickets to the event a cardiff council spokesperson confirmed that they did not know how many free tickets were available but they were not offered to all council staff8 supportedit the event was organised by global live events and had the support of jacksons mother katherine jackson5 his sister la toya and his brothers tito marlon and jackie but not that of his other brothers randy and jermaine his other sister janet several relatives the official michael jackson fan club or even the singers executors as they claimed the concert would distract from the involuntary manslaughter trial of dr conrad murray jacksons former doctor randy and jermaine issued the following statement in opposition to the event while we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honours our brother we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding michaels death as everyone knows those proceedings commence 20 september and this michael forever concert takes place in cardiff wales on 8 october in light of this we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an illtimed event and its promoter global live furthermore the decision to proceed with this concert disrespects opinions and wishes expressed in the strongest terms to global live during conversations in april when this event was presented to the majority of the family as an idea already in its advanced stages there will come a time and place for an amazing and deserving tribute to michael but we feel that the most important tribute we can give to our brother at this time is to seek justice in his name9 the michael jackson fan club agreed with the two brothers issuing a similar statement we share their concerns that this concert is taking place at a most inappropriate time when everyones care and attention should be focused on the matter of justice we believe that as stated by jermaine and randy the most important tribute we can give to michael jackson at this time is to seek justice in his name10 performing actsedit musical acts who participated in the event included the jackson brothers christina aguilera1 beyoncé alexandra
