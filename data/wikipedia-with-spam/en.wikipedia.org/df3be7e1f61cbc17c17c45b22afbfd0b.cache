united statesspecific form of a private limited company it is a business structure that combines the passthrough taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation12 an llc is not a corporation in itself it is a legal form of a company that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions llcs do not need to be organized for profit3 in certain us states for example texas businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license such as legal or medical services may not be allowed to form an llc but may be required to form a similar entity called a professional limited liability company pllc4 contents 1 overview 2 flexibility and default rules 3 income tax 4 advantages 5 disadvantages 6 variations 7 see also 8 references overviewedit a limited liability company llc is a hybrid legal entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship depending on how many owners there are an llc is a type of unincorporated association distinct from a corporation the primary characteristic an llc shares with a corporation is limited liability and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of passthrough income taxation5 it is often more flexible than a corporation and it is wellsuited for companies with a single owner6 although llcs and corporations both possess some analogous features the basic terminology commonly associated with each type of legal entity at least within the united states is sometimes different when an llc is formed it is said to be organized not incorporated or chartered and its founding document is likewise known as its articles of organization instead of its articles of incorporation or its corporate charter internal operations of an llc are further governed by its operating agreement rather than its bylaws the owner of beneficial rights in an llc is known as a member rather than a shareholder7 additionally ownership in an llc is represented by a membership interest or an llc interest sometimes measured in membership units or just units and at other times simply stated only as percentages rather than represented by shares of stock or just shares with ownership measured by the number of shares held by each shareholder similarly when issued in physical rather than electronic form a document evidencing ownership rights in an llc is called a membership certificate rather than a stock certificate8 in the absence of express statutory guidance most american courts have held that llc members are subject to the same common law alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders9 however it is more difficult to pierce the llc veil because llcs do not have many formalities to maintain as long as the llc and the members do not commingle funds it is difficult to pierce the llc veil1011 membership interests in llcs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism the charging order limits the creditor of a debtorpartner or a debtormember to the debtors share of distributions without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights12 limited liability company members may in certain circumstances also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the llc insolvent13 flexibility and default rulesedit llcs are subject to fewer regulations than traditional corporations and thus may allow members to create a more flexible management structure than is possible with other corporate forms as long as it remains within the confines of state law the operating agreement is responsible for the flexibility the members of the llc have in deciding how their llc will be governed14 state statutes typically provide automatic or default rules for how an llc will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise the limited liability company llc has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the united states however the use of a single member llc may do little to protect the assets of the member as compared to operating as an unincorporated entity15 effective august 1 2013 the delaware limited liability company act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members under the amendment prompted by the delaware supreme courts decision in gatz properties llc v auriga capital corp16 parties to an llc remain free to expand restrict or eliminate fiduciary duties in their llc agreements subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing17 under 6 del c section 181017 a delaware llc operating agreement can be written oral or implied it sets forth member capital contributions ownership percentages and management structure like a prenuptial agreement an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buyout rights valuation formulas and transfer restrictions the written llc operating agreement should be signed by all of its members18 income taxedit for us federal income tax purposes an llc is treated by default as a passthrough entity19 if there is only one member in the company the llc is treated as a “disregarded entity” for tax purposes and an individual owner would report the llcs income or loss on schedule c of his or her individual tax return thus income from the llc is taxed at the individual tax rates the default tax status for llcs with multiple members is as a partnership which is required to report income and loss on irs form 1065 under partnership tax treatment each member of the llc as is the case for all partners of a partnership annually receives a form k1 reporting the members distributive share of the llcs income or loss that is then reported on the members individual income tax return20 on the other hand income from corporations is taxed twice once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders thus more tax savings often result if a business formed as an llc rather than a corporation21 an llc with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of irs form 883222 after electing corporate tax status an llc may further elect to be treated as a regular c corporation taxation of the entitys income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members or as an s corporation entity level income and loss passes through to the members some commentators have recommended an llc taxed as a scorporation as the best possible small business structure it combines the simplicity and flexibility of an llc with the tax benefits of an scorporation selfemployment tax savings23 advantagesedit choice of tax regime an llc can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor partnership s corporation or c corporation as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment providing for a great deal of flexibility a limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members distributive share of income gain loss deduction or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in treasury regulation 26 cfr 17041 are met s corporations may not specially allocate profits losses and other tax items under us tax law the owners of the llc called members are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the llc depending on state shield laws in the united states an s corporation has a limited number of stockholders and all of them must be us citizens an llc may have an unlimited number of members and there is no citizenship restriction much less administrative paperwork and recordkeeping than a corporation passthrough taxation ie no double taxation unless the llc elects to be taxed as a c corporation using default tax classification profits are taxed personally at the member level not at the llc level llcs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members however in some jurisdictions such as connecticut case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and llc members can be personally liable for operation of the llc see for example the case of sturm v harb development24 llcs in some states can be set up with just one natural person involved less risk of being stolen by firesale acquisitions more protection against hungry investors for real estate companies each separate property can be owned by its own individual llc thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from crossliability25 disadvantagesedit although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions members of a multiple member llc who operate without one may encounter problems unlike state laws regarding stock corporations which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company thus in the absence of such statutory provisions the members of an llc must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document it may be more difficult to raise financial capital for an llc as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the betterunderstood corporate form with a view toward an eventual ipo one possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it dissolving the llc and converting into a corporation many jurisdictions—including alabama california kentucky new york pennsylvania tennessee and texas—levy a franchise tax or capital values tax on llcs in essence this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the llc pays the state for the benefit of limited liability the franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue an amount based on profits or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state or some combination of those factors or simply a flat fee as in delaware effective in texas for 2007 the franchise tax is replaced with the texas business margin tax this is paid as tax payable revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor in most states however the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations in california both foreign and domestic llcs corporations and trusts whether forprofit or nonprofit—unless the entity is tax exempt—must at least pay a minimum income tax of 800 per year to the franchise tax board and no foreign llc corporation or trust may conduct business in california unless it is duly registered with the california secretary of state renewal fees may also be higher maryland for example charges a stock or nonstock corporation 120 for the initial charter and 100 for an llc the fee for filing the annual report the following year is 300 for stockcorporations and llcs the fee is zero for nonstock corporations in addition certain states such as new york impose a publication requirement upon formation of the llc which requires that the members of the llc publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the llc will be located that it is being formed for llcs located in major metropolitan areas eg new york city the cost of publication can be significant the management structure of an llc may not be clearly stated unlike corporations they are not required to have a board of directors or officers this could also be seen as an advantage to some taxing jurisdictions outside the us are likely to treat a us llc as a corporation regardless of its treatment for us tax purposes—for example a us llc doing business outside the us or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction26 this is very likely where the country such as canada does not recognize llcs as an authorized form of business entity in that country the principals of llcs use many different titles—eg member manager managing member managing director chief executive officer president and partner as such it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the llcs behalf variationsedit a professional limited liability company pllc pllc or pl is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services usually professions where the state requires a license to provide services such as a doctor chiropractor lawyer accountant architect landscape architect or engineer require the formation of a pllc4 however some states such as california do not permit llcs to engage in the practice of a licensed profession exact requirements of pllcs vary from state to state typically a pllcs members must all be professionals practicing the same profession in addition the limitation of personal liability of members does not extend to professional malpractice claims a series llc is a special form of a limited liability company that allows a single llc to segregate its assets into separate series for example a series llc that purchases separate pieces of real estate may put each in a separate series so if the lender forecloses on one piece of property the others are not affected an l3c is a forprofit social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose not maximizing income it is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional llc the social benefits of a nonprofit organization and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise an anonymous limited liability company is a llc for which ownership information is not made publicly available by the state this is typically accomplished by using a thirdparty to act as the organizer and registered agent of the llc27 see alsoedit besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid a belgian bvba and dutch bv private limited company société à responsabilité limitée
