by cbc television for print ads and program promos from the 1960s until 1974 a version of this logo was also used for cbc radio with radio replacing television however this was never used as an official logo for cbc television cbc television provides a complete 24hour network schedule of news sports entertainment and childrens programming in most cases feeding the same programming at the same local times nationwide except to the newfoundland time zone where programs air 30 minutes late on october 9 2006 at 600 am the network switched to a 24hour schedule becoming one of the last major englishlanguage broadcasters to transition to such a schedule most cbcowned stations previously signed off the air during the early morning hours typically from 100 am to 600 am instead of the infomercials aired by most private stations or a simulcast of cbc news network in the style of bbc ones nightly simulcast of bbc news channel the cbc uses the time to air repeats including local news primetime series movies and other programming from the cbc library2 its french counterpart ici radiocanada télé still signs off every night while historically there has been room for regional differences in the schedule as there is today see stations below for cbcowned stations funding has decreased to the point that most of these stations only broadcast 30 to 90 minutes a day of locally produced newscasts and usually no other local programming3 this was screenshot logo from 1986 of cbc television with red and yellow lettering including the cbc logo in white this logo was used as a secondary logo used only in promos and junctions for station identification until 1998 the network carried a variety of american programs in addition to its core canadian programming directly competing with private canadian broadcasters such as ctv and global since then it has restricted itself to canadian programs a handful of british programs and a few american movies and offnetwork repeats since this change the cbc has sometimes struggled to maintain ratings comparable to those it achieved before 1995 although it has seen somewhat of a ratings resurgence in recent years in the 200708 season popular series such as little mosque on the prairie and the border helped the network achieve its strongest ratings performance in over half a decade4 logo used by cbc television from 20012009 previous variants of the logo retained the cbc logo but the text was in a different font in 2002 cbc television and cbc news network became the first broadcasters in canada that are required to provide closed captioning for all of their programming on those networks only outside commercials need not be captioned though a bare majority of them are aired with captions all shows bumpers billboards promos and other internal programming must be captioned the requirement stems from a human rights complaint filed by deaf lawyer henry vlug5 which was settled in 20026 under the cbcs current arrangement with rogers communications for national hockey league broadcast rights hockey night in canada broadcasts on cbcowned stations and affiliates are not technically aired over the cbc television network but over a separate crtclicensed parttime network operated by rogers this was required by the crtc as rogers exercises editorial control and sells all advertising time during the hnic broadcasts even though the cbc bug and promos for other cbc television programs appear throughout hnic7 programmingedit see also list of programs broadcast by cbc television news and current affairsedit see also cbc news the cbcs flagship newscast the national airs sunday through fridays at 1000 pm local time except in newfoundland where it airs at 1030 pm and saturdays at 600 pm est until october 2006 cbc ownedandoperated stations aired a second broadcast of the program at 1100 pm this later broadcast included only the main news portion of the program and excluded the analysis and documentary segment this second airing was later replaced with other programming and as of the 201213 television season was replaced on cbcs major market stations by a halfhour late newscast there is also a short news update at most on late saturday evenings during hockey season this update is usually found during the first intermission of the second game of the doubleheader on hockey night in canada the show is also simultaneously broadcasts rolling coverage from cbc news network from noon to 1 pm local time in most time zones also from 6 to 7 am in regions where a local cbc radio one morning show is not simulcast instead in addition to the mentioned late local newscasts cbc stations in most markets fill early evenings with local news programs generally from 500 pm to 630 pm while most stations also air a single local newscast on weekend evenings comprising a supper hour broadcast on saturdays and a late evening newscast on sundays weekly newsmagazine the fifth estate is also a cbc mainstay as are documentary series such as doc zone sportsedit see also cbc sports and sportsnet one of the most popular shows on cbc television is the weekly saturday night broadcast of nhl hockey games hockey night in canada it has been televised by the network since 1952 during the nhl lockout and subsequent cancellation of the 20042005 hockey season cbc instead aired various recent and classic movies branded as movie night in canada on saturday nights many cultural groups criticized this and suggested the cbc air games from minor hockey leagues the cbc responded that most such broadcast rights were already held by other groups but it did base each movie night broadcast from a different canadian hockey venue other than hockey cbc sports properties include toronto raptors basketball toronto fc soccer8 and various other amateur and professional events it was also the exclusive carrier of canadian curling association events during the 2004–2005 season due to disappointing results and fan outrage over many draws being carried on cbc country canada now called cottage life the association tried to cancel its multiyear deal with the cbc signed in 2004 after the cbc threatened legal action both sides eventually came to an agreement under which earlyround rights reverted to tsn on june 15 2006 the cca announced that tsn would obtain exclusive rights to curling broadcasts in canada as of the 200809 season9 shutting the cbc out of the championship weekend for the first time in 40plus years cbc sports suffered another major blow when it was announced that after the 2007 season the cfl regular season games and the grey cup would be moving to tsn ending the cbcs tenure with the cfl it has been stated that the cfl was not happy with the cbcs lackluster production during the cbcs 2005 union lockout which forced the network to use cbc management to work the behind the scenes telecast and use stadium public address announcers in place of their regular announcer crew10 on june 23 2007 the network aired the first game in a twoyear deal to broadcast toronto blue jays games11 the contract ended at the end of the 2008 season and was not renewed in august 2007 it was also announced that the cbc would broadcast national basketball association games involving the toronto raptors starting with the 2007–08 nba season through at least 20092010 the cbc would carry games for the 20072008 and 20 games for the 20082009 and 20092010 seasons12 in november 2013 the nhl announced that it had signed a 52 billion deal with rogers communications giving them exclusive rights for 12 years starting in 20142015 cbc has been sublicensed to carry nhl games for the first 4 years of the contract as a result of funding reductions from the federal government and decreased revenues in april 2014 cbc announced it would no longer bid for professional sport broadcasting rights13 entertainmentedit among cbc televisions bestknown primetime series are comedy series rick mercer report this hour has 22 minutes and little mosque on the prairie and dramas such as the tudors heartland and intelligence in recent years british series such as coronation street and doctor who have been given greater prominence as noted above it now carries very little american programming apart from some syndicated daytime shows in 2006 the cbc announced radical changes to its primetime lineup including the following new series to premiere that fall dragons den reality intelligence drama rumours comedy underdogs a spinoff of marketplace jozih medical drama a canadiansouth african coproduction the one making a music star a canadian version of the american reality show simulcast by cbc in july 2006 canadian series was not included on the schedule 72 hours true crime crime documentary series already on schedule but will air in core of primetime for first time repeats of the hour on the main cbc network many were surprised by these changes to the cbc schedule which were apparently intended to attract a younger audience to the network some suggested they might alienate the core cbc viewership another note of criticism was made when the network decided to move the national in some time zones to simulcast the american version of the one over the summer this later became a moot point as the one was taken off the air after two weeks after extremely low american and canadian ratings and the newscast resumed its regular schedule in 2006 daytime programming was also revamped while there were still repeats of cbc and foreign series new talk shows such as the gill deacon show and the regional franchise living were added the gill deacon show was cancelled after just seven months and replaced with another talk show steven and chris which is still on the air today steven and chris is also shown on the live well network in the united states living was cancelled in august 2009 on january 9 2007 the cbc began airing a highly publicized new series called little mosque on the prairie a comedy about a muslim family living in rural saskatchewan the series garnered strong ratings as well as international media attention it was also announced that martha stewarts daytime show would be added to the cbc daytime lineup with the nighttime wheel of fortune and jeopardy following in on september 2008 with a few edits to limit the amount of us advertising14 in january 2008 cbc television launched the drama series the border mvp and jpod the reality series the week the women went and the comedy sophie only the border and sophie were renewed for a second season in the fall of 2008 the new series being erica and wild roses began airing in january 2009 beginning in 2005 the cbc has contributed production funds for the bbc wales revival of doctor who for which it received a special credit at the end of each episode this arrangement continued until the end of fourth season broadcast in 2008 the cbc similarly contributed to the first season of the spinoff series torchwood15 more recently the network has also begun picking up canadian rights to some australian series including the drama series janet king16

widescreen feed for standard definition viewers just as ici radiocanada télé has done since september 2007 stationsedit see also list of cbc television stations see also list of defunct cbc and radiocanada television transmitters most cbc television stations including those in the major cities are owned and operated by the cbc itself cbc oo stations operate as a mostly seamless national service with few deviations from the main network schedule although there are some regional differences from time to time for onair identification most cbc stations use the cbc brand rather than their call letters not identifying themselves specifically until signon or signoff though some like torontos cblt do not id themselves at all except through psip all cbc oo stations have a standard call letter naming convention in that the first two letters are cb an itu prefix allocated not to canada but to chile and the last letter is t only the third letter varies from market to market however that letter is typically the same as the third letter of the cbc radio one and cbc radio 2 stations in the same market an exception to this rule are the cbc north stations in yellowknife whitehorse and iqaluit whose call signs begin with cf due to their historic association with the cbcs frontier coverage package prior to the advent of microwave and satellite broadcasting some stations that broadcast from smaller cities are private affiliates of the cbc that is stations which are owned by commercial broadcasters but predominantly incorporate cbc programming within their schedules such stations generally follow the cbc schedule airing a minimum 40 hours per week of network programming however they may opt out of some cbc programming in order to air locally produced programs syndicated series or programs purchased from other broadcasters such as ctv two which do not have a broadcast outlet in the same market in these cases the cbc programming being displaced may be broadcast at a different time than the network or may not be broadcast on the station at all most private affiliates generally opt out of cbcs afternoon schedule and thursday night arts programming private affiliates carry the 10 pm broadcast of the national as a core part of the cbc schedule but generally omitted the 11 pm repeat which is no longer broadcast most private affiliates produce their own local newscasts for a duration of at least 35 minutes some of the private affiliates have begun adding cbcs overnight programming to their schedules since the network began broadcasting 24 hours a day private cbc affiliates are not as common as they were in the past as many such stations have been purchased either by the cbc itself or by canwest global or chum limited respectively becoming e or achannel later a now ctv two stations one private cbc affiliate chbctv in kelowna joined e then known as ch on february 27 2006 when a private cbc affiliate reaffiliates with another network the cbc has normally added a retransmitter of its nearest oo station to ensure that cbc service is continued however due to an agreement between chbc and cfjctv in kamloops cfjc also disaffiliated from the cbc on february 27 2006 but no retransmitters were installed in the licence area former private cbc affiliates ckpgtv prince george and chattv medicine hat disaffiliated on august 31 2008 and joined e but the cbc announced it will not add new retransmitters to these areas incidentally cfjc ckpg and chat are all owned by an independent media company jim pattison group with the closure of e and other changes in the media landscape several former cbc affiliates have since joined city or global or closed altogether according to filings to the canadian radiotelevision and telecommunications commission crtc by thunder bay electronics owner of cbcs thunder bay affiliate ckprdt30 and bell media owner of cbc affiliates cftktv in terrace and cjdctv in dawson creekcitation needed the cbc informed them that it will not extend its association with any of its private affiliates beyond august 31 2011 incidentally that was also the date for analogue to digital transition in canada given recent practice and the cbcs decision not to convert any retransmitters to digital even in markets with populations in the hundreds in thousands it is not expected that the cbc will open new transmitters to replace its affiliates and indeed may pare back its existing transmitter network however in march 2011 ckpr announced that it had come to a programming agreement with the cbc in which the station will continue to provide cbc programming in thunder bay for a period of five years31 on march 16 2012 astral media announced the sale of its assets to bell media owners of ctv and ctv two for 338 billion with cftk and cjdc included in the acquisition32 both stations subsequently became ctv two stations cbc television stations in nunavut the northwest territories and

without their own news operations including cspan and home shopping network carried the cbcs coverage of the terror attacks in new york city and washington dc in the days after september 11 cspan carried cbcs nightly newscast the national anchored by peter mansbridge cspan has also carried cbcs coverage of major events affecting canadians among them canadian federal elections six days in september 2000 that marked the death and state funeral of pierre elliott trudeau the war in iraq the national aired on cspan each night for about three weeks following the attacks on iraq peter

programme hemispheres with australias national broadcaster the abc the program was hosted from sydney and vancouver and included reports from both networks foreign correspondents it was broadcast in both canada and australia and across asia and the pacific on the australia network border audiencesedit cbc television stations can be received in many united states communities along the canada–us border overtheair and have a significant audience in those areas such a phenomenon can also take place within great lakes communities such as ashtabula ohio which received programming from the cbcs london ontario transmitter based upon prevailing atmospheric conditions over lake erie as of september 2010 cbc shut down its analogue transmitter and decided not to replace it with a digital transmitter as a result there is now a giant hole in the coverage of cbc in southwestern ontario both cbc toronto and cbc windsor are over 100 miles from london on and out of range for even the largest antennascitation needed cbcs sports coverage has also attained high viewership in border markets including its coverage of the nhls stanley cup playoffs which was generally considered to be more complete and consistent than coverage by other networks such as nbc its coverage of the olympic games also found a significant audience in border regions primarily due to the fact that cbc aired more events live than nbcs coverage which had been criticized in recent years for tape delaying events to air in primetime even if the event is being held in a market in the pacific time zone during primetime hours on the east where it would still be delayed for west coast primetime33 southeastern michigan including detroit and northern ohio including toledo and surrounding areas receive local

transmitters had to cease transmitting by august 31 2011 broadcasters could either continue serving those markets by transitioning analogue transmitters to digital or cease broadcasting overtheair cable iptv and satellite services are not involved or affected by this digital transition deadline while its fellow canadian broadcasters converted most of their transmitters to digital by the canadian digital television transition deadline of august 31 2011 cbc converted only about half of the analogue transmitters in mandatory areas to digital 15 of 28 markets with cbc television stations and 14 of 28 markets with télévision de radiocanada stations due to financial difficulties reported by the corporation the corporation published digital transition plans for none of its analogue retransmitters in mandatory markets to be converted to digital by the deadline under this plan communities that receive analogue signals by rebroadcast transmitters in mandatory markets would lose their overtheair signals as of the deadline rebroadcast transmitters account for 23 of the 48 cbc and radiocanada transmitters in mandatory markets mandatory markets losing both cbc and radiocanada overtheair signals include london ontario metropolitan area population 457000 and saskatoon saskatchewan metro area population 257000 in both of those markets the corporations television transmitters are the only ones that were not planned to be converted to digital by the deadline because rebroadcast transmitters were not planned to be converted to digital many markets stood to lose overtheair coverage from cbc or radiocanada or both as a result only seven of the markets subject to the august 31 2011 transition deadline were planned to have both cbc and radiocanada in digital and 13 other markets were planned to have either cbc or radiocanada in digital in midaugust 2011 the crtc granted the cbc an extension until august 31 2012 to continue operating its analogue transmitters in markets subject to the august 31 2011 transition deadline this crtc decision prevented many markets subject to the transition deadline from losing signals for cbc or radiocanada or both at the transition deadline at the transition deadline barrie ontario lost both cbc and radiocanada signals as the cbc did not request that the crtc allow these transmitters to continue operating in markets where a digital transmitter was installed existing coverage areas were not necessarily maintained for instance the cbc implemented a digital transmitter covering fredericton new brunswick in the place of the existing transmitter covering saint john new brunswick and fredericton and decided to maintain analogue service to saint john according to cbcs application for this transmitter to the crtc the population served by the digital transmitter would be 113930 people versus 303465 served by the existing analogue transmitter in victoria the replacement of the vancouver analogue transmitters with digital ones only allowed only some northeastern parts of the metropolitan area total population 330000 to receive either cbc or radiocanada cbc announced on april 4 2012 that it will shut down all of its approximately 620 analogue television transmitters on july 31 201234 with no plans to install digital transmitters in their place thus reducing the total number of the corporations television transmitters across the country down to 27 according to the cbc this would reduce the corporations yearly costs by 10 million no plans have been announced to use subchannels to maintain overtheair signals for both cbc and radiocanada in markets where the corporation has one digital transmitter in fact in its crtc application to shut down all of its analogue television transmitters the cbc communicated its opposition to use of subchannels citing costs amongst other reasons the cbc had stated that the useful life of cbcradiocanada’s satellite distribution backbone for analogue transmission ends in 2013 and that it will not reinvest in that infrastructure given the inevitability of analogue obsolescence35 despite the shutdown of the rebroadcasters few viewers actually lost access to cbc programming due to the very high penetration of cable and satellite which is all but essential for acceptable television in much of canada particularly rural areas cbc and affiliate

the cbc stated that its 654 analogue transmitters reached 98 of the population and that it planned on installing 44 digital transmitters reaching 80 of canadians36 the crtc decided to impose a mandatory transition date switching overtheair television signals from analog to digital following consultation with cbc and the public cbc had requested during this consultation that broadcasters be given four years to transition following the consultation on may 17 2007 the crtc imposed a transition timeline of four years resulting in a transition deadline of august 31 2011 and requiring that overtheair analogue transmitters be shut off by that date on july 6 2009 the crtc limited the august 31 2011 transition deadline to certain mandatory markets greatly reducing the number of transmitters needing to be transitioned in cbcs 2009–2010 corporate plan the corporation stated that it planned on having 30 transmitters broadcasting in digital by the deadline costing 30 million on august 6 2010 the cbc issued a press release stating that due to financial reasons the cbc and radiocanada would only transition 27 transmitters total one in each market where there was an originating station ie a cbc or radiocanada television station located in that market further the cbc stated in the release that only 15 of the transmitters would be in place by august 31 2011 due to lack of available funds and that the remainder would not be on the air until as late as august 31 201237 additionally the cbc stated in the release that it was asking the crtc for permission to continue broadcasting in analogue until the identified transmitters for transition were up and running at the time of the press release only eight of the corporations transmitters four cbc and four radio canada were broadcasting in digital on november 30 2010 cbcs senior director of regulatory affairs issued a letter to the crtc regarding cbcs plans for transitioning to digital the letter states cbcradiocanada will not be converting its analogue retransmitters in mandatory markets to digital after august 31 2011 38 on december 16 2010 some months after the crtc issued a bulletin reminding broadcasters that analog transmitters had to be shut off by the deadline in mandatory markets the cbc revised the documents accompanying its august 6 2010 news release to state that it had the money for and is striving to transition all 27 transmitters by august 31 2011 on march 23 2011 the crtc rejected an application by the cbc to install a digital transmitter serving fredericton new brunswick in place of the analogue transmitter serving fredericton and saint john new brunswick which would have served only 625 of the population served by the existing analogue transmitter39 the cbc issued a press release stating cbcradiocanada intends to refile its application with the crtc to provide more detailed cost estimates that will allow the commission to better understand the unfeasibility of replicating the corporation’s current analogue coverage40 the press release further added that the cbc suggests coverage could be maintained if the crtc were to allow cbc television to continue providing the analogue service it offers today – much in the same way the commission permitted recently in the case of yellowknife whitehorse and iqaluit on march 29 2011 the crtc added the following condition of licence to overtheair stations owned by cbc unless otherwise authorized by the commission the licensee shall not transmit analogue television signals after 31 august 2011 in mandatory

cbcs mandatory market rebroadcasting transmitters in analogue to remain onair until august 31 201242 before that deadline cbcs licence renewal process would take place and cbcs digital transition

plans in which it announced that all of its approximately 620 analogue television transmitters would be shut down on july 31 2012 which was earlier than planned due to funding reductions from the
