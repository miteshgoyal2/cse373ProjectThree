river thames as it looks today the original cottage was built in 1780 by william craven the sixth baron craven3 and was located on the centre circle of the pitch at the time the surrounding areas were woods which made up part of anne boleyns hunting grounds3 the cottage was lived in by edward bulwerlytton3 who wrote the last days of pompeii13 and other somewhat notable and moneyed persons3 until it was destroyed by fire in may 18883 many rumours persist among fulham fans of past tenants of craven cottage sir arthur conan doyle jeremy bentham florence nightingale and even queen victoria are reputed to have stayed there although there is no real evidence for this following the fire the site was abandoned3 fulham had had 8 previous grounds14 before settling in at craven cottage for good therefore the cottagers have had 12 grounds overall including a temporary stay at loftus road15 meaning that only their former landlords and rivals qpr have had more home grounds 14 in british football of particular note was ranelagh house fulhams palatial home from 1886–188816 under construction 1894–1905edit the rabbit hutch stand along stevenage road before archibald leitchs redesign in 19045 when representatives of fulham first came across the land in 1894 it was so overgrown that it took two years to be made suitable for football to be played on it3 a deal was struck for the owners of the ground to carry out the work in return for which they would receive a proportion of the gate receipts3 the first football match at which there were any gate receipts was when fulham played against minerva in the middlesex senior cup on 10 october 18963 the grounds first stand was built shortly after3 described as looking like an orange box it consisted of four wooden structures each holding some 250 seats and later was affectionately nicknamed the rabbit hutch3 in 1904 london county council became concerned with the level of safety at the ground and tried to get it closed3 a court case followed in january 1905 as a result of which archibald leitch a scottish architect who had risen to prominence after his building of the ibrox stadium a few years earlier17 was hired to work on the stadium3 in a scheme costing £150003 a record for the time18 he built a pavilion the presentday cottage itself3 and the stevenage road stand3 in his characteristic red brick style3 the stand on stevenage road celebrated its centenary in the 2005–2006 season19 and following the death of fulham fcs favourite son former england captain johnny haynes in a car accident in october 200520 the stevenage road stand was renamed the johnny haynes stand after the club sought the opinions of fulham supporters21 the facade of the johnny haynes stand both the johnny haynes stand and cottage remain among the finest examples of archibald leitch football architecture to remain in existence and both have been designated as grade ii listed buildings1 establishing itself as a stadiumedit an england v wales match was played at the ground in 19072223 followed by a rugby league international between england and australia in 191124 one of the clubs directors henry norris and his friend william hall took over arsenal in the early 1910s25 the plan being to merge fulham with arsenal26 to form a london superclub at craven cottage27 this move was largely motivated by fulhams failure thus far to gain promotion to the top division of english football there were also plans for henry norris to build a larger stadium on the other side of stevenage road but there was little need after the merger idea failed during this era the cottage was used for choir singing and marching bands along with other performances and mass2829 in 1933 there were plans to demolish the ground and start again from scratch with a new 80000 capacity stadium these plans never materialised mainly due to the great depression on 8 october 1938 49335 spectators watched fulham play millwall5 the reason for this exceptionally large crowd was that the game at stamford bridge had suddenly been cancelled and so a lot of people made their way west to the cottage that afternoon instead it was the largest attendance ever at craven cottage and the record remains today unlikely to be bettered as it is now an allseater stadium with currently no room for more than 25700 during the 193060s era fulham often averaged over 25000 however the official attendances can be considered somewhat dubious in this era as many fans would get in by climbing over the fence from bishops park into the putney end as at many other grounds fans would sometimes pay at the turnstiles but not be counted this boot money would be given to the players stuffed in their boots and would not be counted in the gate money the ground hosted several football games for the 1948 summer olympics and is one of the last extant that did30 postwaredit johnny haynes fulhams most famous player in his classic handonhip pose outside the stand named after him it wasnt until after fulham first reached the top division in 1949 that further improvements were made to the stadium in 1962 fulham became the final side in the first division to erect floodlights31 the floodlights were said to be the most expensive in europe at the time as they were so modern the lights were like large pylons towering 50 metres over the ground and were similar in appearance to those at the waca an electronic scoreboard was installed on the riverside terrace at the same time as the floodlights were installed and flagpoles flying the flags of all of the other first division teams were flown from them32 following the sale of alan mullery to tottenham hotspur in 1964 for £72500 the hammersmith end had a roof put over it33 at a cost of approximately £42500 although fulham was relegated the development of craven cottage continued the riverside terracing infamous for the fact that fans occupying it would turn their heads annually to watch the boat race pass34 was replaced by what was officially named the eric miller stand35 eric miller being a director of the club at the time36 the stand which cost £33400034 and held 4200 seats was opened with a friendly game against benfica in february 1972 which included eusébio37 pelé was also to appear on the ground with a friendly played against his team santos fc38 the miller stand bought the seated capacity up to 11000 out of a total 4000039 eric miller committed suicide five years later after a political and financial scandal40 and had shady dealing with trying to move fulham away from the cottage the stand is now better known as the riverside stand35 on boxing day 1963 craven cottage was the venue of the fastest hattrick in the history of the english football league which was completed in less than three minutes by graham leggat this helped his fulham team to beat ipswich 10–1 a club record4142 the international record is held by jimmy oconnor an irish player who notched up his hat trick in 2 minutes 14 seconds in 196743 between 1980 and 1984 fulham rugby league played their home games at the cottage12 they have since evolved into the london crusaders the london broncos and harlequins rugby league12 before reverting to london broncos ahead of the 2012 season44 craven cottage held the teams largest ever crowd at any ground with 15013 at a game against wakefield trinity on 15 february 198145 modern timesedit craven cottage prior to the implementation of the taylor report the historic triangular gable on top of the haynes stand one of the few extant at british grounds when the hillsborough disaster occurred in 1989 fulham were in the second bottom rung of the football league46 but following the taylor report fulhams ambitious chairman jimmy hill tabled plans in 1996 for an allseater stadium47 these plans never came to fruition partly due to local residents pressure groups and by the time fulham reached the premiership they still had standing areas in the ground18 something virtually unheard of at the time a year remained to do something about this teams reaching the second tier for the first time are allowed a threeyear period to reach the required standards for the top two divisions484950 but by the time the last league game was played there against leicester city on 27 april 2002 no building plans 51 had been made two more intertoto cup games were played there later that year against fc haka of finland52 and egaleo fc of greece53 and the eventual solution was to decamp to loftus road home of local rivals qpr54 during this time many fulham fans only went to away games in protest of moving from craven cottage555657 back to the cottage later to become the fulham supporters trust was set up as a fans pressure group to encourage the chairman and his advisers that craven cottage was the only viable option for fulham football club5859 after one and a half seasons at loftus road no work had been done on the cottage in december 2003 plans were unveiled for £8million worth of major refurbishment work to bring it in line with premier league requirements16061 with planning permission granted work began in january 2004 in order to meet the deadline of the new season the work proceeded as scheduled and the club were able to return to their home for the start of the 2004–05 season their first game in the newlook 22000 allseater stadium was a preseason friendly against watford on 10 july 20041 fenway sports group originally partnered with fulham in 2009 due to the perceived heritage and quirks shared between the cottage and fenway park saying no english club identifies with its stadium as much as fulham boston red sox were later in bed with liverpool fc after the takeover by fenway sports group the current stadium was one of the premierships smallest grounds at the time of fulhams relegation at the end of the 2013–14 season it was thirdsmallest after the kc stadium and the liberty stadium62 much admired for its fine architecture63 the stadium has recently hosted a few international games mostly including australia this venue is suitable for australia because most of the countrys top players are based in europe and west london has a significant community of expatriate australians also greece vs south korea was hosted on 6 february 200764 in 2011 brazil played ghana in an international friendly65 and the womens champions league final was hosted66 craven cottage often hosts many other events such as 5aside football tournaments and weddings67 also many have sunday lunch at the riverside restaurant68 or the cottage cafe6 on nonmatch days craven cottage hosted the oxbridge varsity football match annually between 1991 and 2000 and again in 2003 2006 the same day as the famous boat race69 2008 and 200970 and will once again host it in 201471 as well as having a soccer aid warmup match in 200672 the halftime entertainment often includes the sw6ers73 previously called the cravenettes7475 which are a group of female cheerleaders however other events have included brass bands michael jackson albeit just walking on the pitch once as opposed to performing76 travis playing arabic dancing keepie uppie professionals and presentational awards most games also feature the fulham flutter a halftime draw77 and a shootout competition of some kind78 usually involving scoring through a hoop or beat the goalie on the first home game of the season there is a carnival where every fulham fan is expected to turn up in blackandwhite colours there is usually live rock bands player signings clowns stilt walkers a steel calypso band food stalls and a free training session for children in bishops park the fulham ladies before their demise79 and reserve teams occasionally play home matches at the cottage other than this they generally play at the clubs training ground at motspur park or at kingstonian and afc wimbledons stadium kingsmeadow craven cottage is known by several affectionate nicknames from fans including the river cottage8081 the fortress or fortress fulham55 thameside the friendy confines sw6 lord of the banks the house of hope the pavilion of perfection the true fulham palace and the palatial home the thames at the banks of the cottage is often referred to as old father828384 or the river of dreams the most accessible route to the ground is to walk through bishops park from putney bridge the nearest underground station85 often known as the green mile by fulham fans as it is roughly a mile walk through pleasant greenery86 the telegraph ranked the cottage 9th out of 54 grounds to hold premiership football87 plansedit on 27 july 2012 fulham fc were granted permission to redevelop the riverside stand increasing the capacity of craven cottage to 30000 seats8889 beforehand various rumours arose including plans to return to groundsharing with qpr in a new 40000 seater white city stadium9091 although these now appear firmly on hold with the construction of the westfield shopping centre on the proposed site the board seem to have moved away from their ambition to make fulham the manchester united of the south as it became clear how expensive such a plan would be92 with large spaces of land at a premium in southwest london fulham appear to be committed to a gradual increase of the grounds capacity often during the summer between seasons the capacity of craven cottage has been increased during summers for instance in 2008 with a small increase in the capacity of the hammersmith end fulham previously announced in 2007 that they are planning to increase the capacity of craven cottage by 4000 seats93 but this is yet to be implemented there was also proposals for a bridge to span the thames for a redeveloped riverside stand and a museum94 more substantial plans arose in october 2011 with the fulham forever campaign95 with alfayed selling his harrods department store for £15 billion in may 201096 it is reasonable to presume that some of this money which has kickstarted this larger scale plan into life a detailed plan into the possibilities of expansion highlighted the riverside stand as the only viable area for expansion the scheme involves the demolition of the back of the riverside stand with a new tier of seating added on top of the current one and a row of corporate boxes bringing craven cottage up to 30000 capacity97 as this would be a major project in a sensitive area the club has taken into consideration many points local residents may have problems with the riverside walk would be reopened light pollution would be reduced with the removal of floodlight masts new access points would make matchday crowds more manageable and the new stand would be respectful in design to its position on the river thames although there is no time scheme for when the project will begin the club is already far into the consultation phase and it appeared would like to begin soon during 2012–1398

sit100101 and many stand during games at the back rows of the stand if fulham win the toss they usually choose to play towards the hammersmith end in the second half the stand had terracing until the reopening of the ground in 2004 when it was replaced with seating in order to comply with league rules following the taylor report100 for several seasons national flags of the players represented at fulham were hung from the roof102 there is a large permanent banner in the river corner reading we are fulham103 the little switzerland section of the putney end seen in the background during an australia vs new zealand friendly in 2005 putney endedit the putney end is the southernmost stand in the ground nearest to putney and backing onto bishops park this generally hosts visiting and neutral supporters101 though often this is mixed with home and away fans when the ground became redeveloped with the standing terraces replaced in 2003–04 the club applied for a licence to have a designated neutral area in the rows closest to the cottage nicknamed little switzerland104 due to fulhams history of having no segregation in the putney end and no history of crowd trouble the fa gave the club special dispensation to allow for this making fulham the only club currently in the uk to have such an area105 flags of every nationality in the fulham squad were hung from the roofing although they were removed after the 2006–07 season commenced and there is now an electronic scoreboard in place there is a plane tree in the corner by the river106 the only remaining tree in a senior british football ground105 riverside standedit the current riverside stand beside the river thames the riverside was originally terracing that backed onto the thames32 it also featured large advertising hoardings above the fans32 by 1973 a proper seated stand had been built called the eric miller stand one of the directors at the time35 the stand was opened in a prestigious friendly against sl benfica who included eusébio in the team37 the name of the stand became called simply the riverside after the discovery of eric millers suicide who had been under investigation for fraud and embezzlement40 the riverside stand backs onto the river thames32101 and is elevated uniquely above the pitch107 unlike the other 3 stands it contains the corporate hospitality seating101 alongside fulham fans101 jimmy hill once referred to the riverside being a bit like the london palladium as blocks v w the middle section are often filled with the rich and famous including often alfayed there are several harrods advertising boardings and above these is the gantry for the press and cameras100 tickets in this area are often the easiest to buy not surprisingly they are also some of the more expensive108 it has the hammersmith end to its left the putney end to its right and is opposite the johnny haynes stand101 during the 1970s craven cottage flooded with water gushing in from the riverside the stand houses the george cohen restaurant109 while on nonmatch days there is the cottage cafe located near to the cottage itself6 the river café is also located nearby110111 under tommy trinders chairmanship in the 60s flags of all other teams in the division 1 were proudly flown along the thames32 however when fulham were relegated in 1968112 trinder decided not to change the flags as fulham wont be in this division next season true to trinders prophecy fulham were relegated again113 the roof of the stand has been used by sponsors with visitflorida currently advertising in this

stand was renamed after former player johnny haynes21118 the exterior facing stevenage road has a brick façade32119 and features the clubs old emblem in the artwork119 decorative pillars show the clubs foundation date as 1880 though this is thought to be incorrect also a special stone to commemorate fulham 2000 and the cottagers return to craven cottage was engraved on the façade119 the family enclosures are located in the two corners of the stand one nearest to the hammersmith end and one nearest to the putney end100101120 the front of the stand now contains plastic seating but originally was a standing area children were often placed at the front of this enclosure and the area had a distinctive white picket fence to keep fans off the pitch up until the 1970s the pavilionedit the pavilion from outside the stadium the cottage pavilion dates back to 1905 along with the johnny haynes stand1 built by renowned football architect archibald leitch1 the reason the cottage was built was due to an oversight in the stevenage road stand as it was then as leitch had forgotten to accommodate changing rooms in his final plans121 besides being the changing rooms the cottage also called the clubhouse is traditionally used by the players families and friends who sit on the balcony to watch the game100 in the past board meetings used to be held in the cottage itself as well there is a large tapestry draped from the cottage which says still believe it encapsulates the nowfamous moment when fans facing defeat against hamburg sv in the europa league semifinal roused the players with
