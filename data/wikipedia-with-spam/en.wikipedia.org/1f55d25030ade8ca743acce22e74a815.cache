tangletown is the part of seattles wallingford neighborhood that lies north of n 50th street near green lake the neighborhood is thought to have been created by real estate agents during the housing boom for branding purposes of note are its k streets kensington kenwood keystone and kirkwood places n the concentration of mostly retail businesses on n 55th street near meridian avenue is known variously as tangletown or meridian and considered by some to be more closely associated with greenlake than wallingford the likely source for the name tangletown is the irregular configuration of seattle s street grid in this transition zone where wallingford shades into the green lake neighborhood some of which follow the contours of green lake others conforming to the citys basic grid an alternative explanation is that the neighborhood was given the name tangletown years ago when a streetcar interchange occupied the space where businesses and condominiums now stand meridian sometimes refers to a wider neighborhood than tangletown which refers strictly to the retail district one of the neighborhoods principal landmarks the keystone building built in 1910 by dj orner son see image
