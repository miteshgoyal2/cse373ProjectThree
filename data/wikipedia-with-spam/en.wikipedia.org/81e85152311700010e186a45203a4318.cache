outline of computer science from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search the following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to computer science computer science also called computing science is the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their implementation and application in computer systems one well known subject classification system for computer science is the acm computing classification system devised by the association for computing machinery contents 1 what type of thing is computer science 2 subfields 21 mathematical foundations 22 algorithms and data structures 23 artificial intelligence 24 communication and security 25 computer architecture 26 computer graphics 27 concurrent parallel and distributed systems 28 databases 29 programming languages and compilers 210 scientific computing 211 software engineering 212 theory of computation 3 history 4 professions 5 basic concepts 51 data and data structures 52 other 6 programming paradigms 7 see also 8 external links what type of thing is computer scienceedit computer science can be described as all of the following academic discipline science applied science subfieldsedit mathematical foundationsedit coding theory – useful in networking and other areas where computers communicate with each other game theory – useful in artificial intelligence and cybernetics graph theory – foundations for data structures and searching algorithms mathematical logic – boolean logic and other ways of modeling logical queries the uses and limitations of formal proof methods number theory – theory of the integers used in cryptography as well as a test domain in artificial intelligence algorithms and data structuresedit algorithms – sequential and parallel computational procedures for solving a wide range of problems data structures – the organization and manipulation of data artificial intelligenceedit outline of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence – the implementation and study of systems that exhibit an autonomous intelligence or behavior of their own automated reasoning – solving engines such as used in prolog which produce steps to a result given a query on a fact and rule database and automated theorem provers that aim to prove mathematical theorems with some assistance from a programmer computer vision – algorithms for identifying threedimensional objects from a twodimensional picture soft computing the use of inexact solutions for otherwise extremely difficult problems machine learning automated creation of a set of rules and axioms based on input evolutionary computing biologically inspired algorithms natural language processing building systems and algorithms that analyze understand and generate natural human languages robotics – algorithms for controlling the behaviour of robots communication and securityedit networking – algorithms and protocols for reliably communicating data across different shared or dedicated media often including error correction computer security – practical aspects of securing computer systems and computer networks cryptography – applies results from complexity probability algebra and number theory to invent and break codes and analyze the security of cryptographic protocols computer architectureedit computer architecture – the design organization optimization and verification of a computer system mostly about cpus and memory subsystem and the bus connecting them operating systems – systems for managing computer programs and providing the basis of a usable system computer graphicsedit computer graphics – algorithms both for generating visual images synthetically and for integrating or altering visual and spatial information sampled from the real world image processing – determining information from an image through computation information visualization – methods for representing and displaying abstract data to facilitate human interaction for exploration and understanding concurrent parallel and distributed systemsedit parallel computing the theory and practice of simultaneous computation data safety in any multitasking or multithreaded environment concurrency computer science – computing using multiple concurrent threads of execution devising algorithms for solving problems on multiple processors to achieve maximal speedup compared to sequential execution distributed computing – computing using multiple computing devices over a network to accomplish a common objective or task and thereby reducing the latency involved in single processor contributions for any task databasesedit relational databases – the set theoretic and algorithmic foundation of databases structured storage nonrelational databases such as nosql databases data mining – study of algorithms for searching and processing information in documents and databases closely related to information retrieval programming languages

quantitative analysis techniques and using computers to analyze and solve scientific problems numerical analysis – approximate numerical solution of mathematical problems such as rootfinding integration the solution of ordinary differential equations the approximation of special functions symbolic computation – manipulation and solution of expressions in symbolic form also known as computer algebra computational physics – numerical simulations of large nonanalytic systems computational chemistry – computational modelling of theoretical chemistry in order to determine chemical structures and properties bioinformatics and computational biology – the use of computer science to maintain analyse store biological data and to assist in solving biological problems such as protein folding function prediction and phylogeny computational neuroscience – computational modelling of neurophysiology software engineeringedit formal methods – mathematical approaches for describing and reasoning about software designs software engineering – the principles and practice of designing developing and testing programs as well as proper engineering practices algorithm design – using ideas from algorithm theory to creatively design solutions to real tasks computer programming – the practice of using a programming language to implement algorithms human–computer interaction – the study and design of computer interfaces that people use reverse engineering – the application of the scientific method to the understanding of arbitrary existing software theory of computationedit main article theory of computation automata theory – different logical structures for solving problems computability theory – what is calculable with the current models of computers proofs developed by alan turing and others provide insight into the possibilities of what may be computed and what may not list of unsolved problems in computer science computational complexity theory – fundamental
