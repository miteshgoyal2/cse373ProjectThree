the 15th century qualifying terms such as american indian and east indian were and are commonly used to avoid ambiguity the us government has since coined the term native american to refer to the indigenous peoples of the united states but terms such as american indian remain popular among both indigenous and nonindigenous populations since the 1980 indian americans have been categorized as asian indian within the broader subgroup of asian american by the united states census bureau9 while east indian remains in use the term south asian is often chosen instead for academic and

bellingham washington on september 5 1907 epitomized the low tolerance in the us for indians and hindus while antiasian racism was embedded in us politics and culture in the early 20th century indians were also racialized for their anticolonialism with us officials casting them as a hindu menace pushing for western imperial expansion abroad13 although labeled hindu the majority of indians were sikh13 in the 1923 case united states v bhagat singh thind the supreme court ruled that high caste hindus were not white persons and were therefore racially ineligible for naturalized citizenship14 the court also argued that the racial difference between indians and whites was so great that the great body of our people would reject assimilation with indians14 it was after the luce–celler act of 1946 that a quota of 100 indians per year could immigrate to the us and become citizens15 the immigration and nationality act of 1965 dramatically opened entry to the us to immigrants other than
