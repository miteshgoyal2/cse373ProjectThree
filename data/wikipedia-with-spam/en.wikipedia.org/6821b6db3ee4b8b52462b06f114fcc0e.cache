preferreds is a type of stock which may have any combination of features not possessed by common stock including properties of both an equity and a debt instrument and is generally considered a hybrid instrument preferred stocks are senior ie higher ranking to common stock but subordinate to bonds in terms of claim or rights to their share of the assets of the company1 and may have priority over common stock ordinary shares in the payment of dividends and upon liquidation terms of the preferred stock are described in the articles of association like bonds preferred stocks are rated by the major creditrating companies the rating for preferreds is generally lower than for bonds because preferred dividends do not carry the same guarantees as interest payments from bonds and because preferredstock holders claims are junior to those of all creditors contents 1 features 11 preference in dividends 12 other features or rights 2 types 3 usage 4 users 5 advantages of preference shares

have any combination of features not possessed by common stock the following features are usually associated with preferred stock2 preference in dividends preference in assets in the event of liquidation convertibility to common stock callability ability to be redeemed before it matures at the option of the corporation possibly subject to a spens clause nonvoting preference in dividendsedit in general preferred stock has preference in dividend payments the preference does not assure the payment of dividends but the company must pay the stated dividends on preferred stock before paying any dividends on common stock2 preferred stock can be cumulative or noncumulative a cumulative preferred requires that if a company fails to pay a dividend or pays less than the stated rate it must make up for it at a later time dividends accumulate with each passed dividend period which may be quarterly semiannually or annually when a dividend is not paid in time it has passed all passed dividends on a cumulative stock make up a dividend in arrears a stock without this feature is known as a noncumulative or straight3 preferred stock any dividends passed are lost if not declared4 other features or rightsedit preferred stock may or may not have a fixed liquidation value or par value associated with it this represents the amount of capital which was contributed to the corporation when the shares were first issued5 preferred stock has a claim on liquidation proceeds of a stock corporation equal to its par or liquidation value unless otherwise negotiated this claim is senior to that of common stock which has only a residual claim almost all preferred shares have a negotiated fixeddividend amount the dividend is usually specified as a percentage of the par value or as a fixed amount for example pacific gas electric 6 series a preferred sometimes dividends on preferred shares may be negotiated as floating they may change according to a benchmark interestrate index such as libor some preferred shares have special voting rights to approve extraordinary events such as the issuance of new shares or approval of the acquisition of a company or to elect directors but most preferred shares have no voting rights associated with them some preferred shares gain voting rights when the preferred dividends are in arrears for a substantial time this is all variable on the rights assigned to the preferred shares at the time of incorporation the above list which includes several customary rights is not comprehensive preferred shares like other legal arrangements may specify nearly any right conceivable preferred shares in the us normally carry a call provision6 enabling the issuing corporation to repurchase the share at its usually limited discretion typesedit in addition to straight preferred stock there is diversity in the preferred stock market additional types of preferred stock include prior preferred stock—many companies have different issues of preferred stock outstanding at one time one issue is usually designated highestpriority if the company has only enough money to meet the dividend schedule on one of the preferred issues it makes the payments on the prior preferred therefore prior preferreds have less credit risk than other preferred stocks but usually offers a lower yield preference preferred stock—ranked behind a companys prior preferred stock on a seniority basis are its preference preferred issues these issues receive preference over all other classes of the companys preferred except for prior preferred if the company issues more than one issue of preference preferred the issues are ranked by seniority one issue is designated first preference the nextsenior issue is the second and so on convertible preferred stock—these are preferred issues which holders can exchange for a predetermined number of the companys commonstock shares this exchange may occur at any time the investor chooses regardless of the market price of the common stock it is a oneway deal one cannot convert the common stock back to preferred stock a variant of this is the antidilutive convertible preferred recently made popular by investment banker stan medley who structured several variants of these preferred for some forty plus public companies in the variants used by stan medley the preferred share converts to either a percentage of the companys common shares or a fixed dollar amount of common shares rather than a set number of shares of common7 the intention is to ameliorate the bad effects investors suffer from rampant shorting and dilutive efforts on the otc markets cumulative preferred stock—if the dividend is not paid it will accumulate for future payment exchangeable preferred stock—this type of preferred stock carries an embedded option to be exchanged for some other security participating preferred stock—these preferred issues offer holders the opportunity to receive extra dividends if the company achieves predetermined financial goals investors who purchased these stocks receive their regular dividend regardless of company performance assuming the company does well enough to make its annual dividend payments if the company achieves predetermined sales earnings or profitability goals the investors receive an additional dividend perpetual preferred stock—this type of preferred stock has no fixed date on which invested capital will be returned to the shareholder although there are redemption privileges held by the corporation most preferred stock is issued without a redemption date putable preferred stock—these issues have a put privilege whereby the holder may under certain conditions force the issuer to redeem shares monthly income preferred stock—a combination of preferred stock and subordinated debt noncumulative preferred stock—dividends for this type of preferred stock will not accumulate if they are unpaid very common in trups and bank preferred stock since under bis rules preferred stock must be noncumulative if it is to be included in tier 1 capital8 supervoting stock—a class of stock that provides its holders with larger than proportionate voting rights compared with another class of stock issued by the same company9 it enables a limited number of stockholders to control a company usually the purpose of the super voting shares is to give key company insiders greater control over the companys voting rights and thus its board and corporate actions the existence of super voting shares can also be an effective defense against hostile takeovers since key insiders can maintain majority voting control of their company without actually owning more than half of the outstanding shares10 usageedit preferred stocks offer a company an alternative form of financing—for example through pensionled funding in some cases a company can defer dividends by going into arrears with little penalty or risk to its credit rating however such action could have a negative impact on the company meeting the terms of its financing contract11 with traditional debt payments are required a missed payment would put the company in default occasionally companies use preferred shares as means of preventing hostile takeovers creating preferred shares with a poison pill or forcedexchange or conversion features which are exercised upon a change in control some corporations contain provisions in their charters authorizing the issuance of preferred stock whose terms and conditions may be determined by the board of directors when issued these blank checks are often used as a takeover defense they may be assigned very high liquidation value which must be redeemed in the event of a change of control or may have great supervoting powers when a corporation goes bankrupt there may be enough money to repay holders of preferred issues known as senior but not enough money for junior issues therefore when preferred shares are first issued their governing document may contain protective provisions preventing the issuance of new preferred shares with a senior claim individual series of preferred shares may have a senior paripassu equal or junior relationship with other series issued by the same corporation usersedit preferred shares are more common in private or prepublic companies where it is useful to distinguish between the control of and the economic interest in the company government regulations and the rules of stock exchanges may either encourage or discourage the issuance of publicly traded preferred shares in many countries banks are encouraged to issue preferred stock as a source of tier 1 capital on the other hand the tel aviv stock exchange prohibits listed companies from having more than one class of capital stockcitation needed a company may issue several classes of preferred stock it may undergo several rounds of financing with each round receiving separate rights and having a separate class of preferred stock such a company might have series a preferred series b preferred series c preferred and common stock in the united states there are two types of preferred stocks straight preferreds and convertible preferreds straight preferreds are issued in perpetuity although some are subject to call by the issuer under certain conditions and pay a stipulated rate of interest to the holder convertible preferreds—in addition to the foregoing features of a straight preferred—contain a provision by which the holder may convert the preferred into the common stock of the company or sometimes into the common stock of an affiliated company under certain conditions among which may be the specification of a future date when conversion may begin a certain number of common shares per preferred share or a certain price per share for the common stock there are incometax advantages generally available to corporations investing in preferred stocks in the united states see dividends received deduction but for individuals a straight preferred stock a hybrid between a bond and a stock bears some disadvantages of each type of securities without enjoying the advantages of either like a bond a straight preferred does not participate in future earnings and dividend growth of the company or growth in the price of the common stock however a bond has greater security than the preferred and has a maturity date at which the principal is to be repaid like the common the preferred has less security protection than the bond however the potential increase in the market price of the common and its dividends paid from future growth of the company is lacking for the preferred one advantage of the preferred to its issuer is that the preferred receives better equity credit at rating agencies than straight debt since it is usually perpetual also certain types of preferred stock qualify as tier 1 capital this allows financial institutions to satisfy regulatory requirements without diluting common shareholders through preferred stock financial institutions are able to gain leverage while receiving tier 1 equity credit if an investor paid par 100 today for a typical straight preferred such an investment would give a current yield of just over six percent if in a few years 10year treasuries were to yield more than 13 percent to maturity as they did in 1981 these preferreds would yield at least 13 percent since the rate of dividend is fixed this would reduce their market price to 46 a 54percent loss the difference between straight preferreds and treasuries or any investmentgrade federalagency or corporate bond is that the bonds would move up to par as their maturity date approaches however the straight preferred having no maturity date might remain at these 40 levels or lower for a long time advantages of straight preferreds may include higher yields and—in the us at least—tax advantages they yield about 2 percent more than 10year treasuries rank ahead of common stock in case of bankruptcy and dividends are taxable at a maximum rate of 15 rather than at ordinaryincome rates as with bond interest advantages of preference sharesedit no obligation for dividends a company is not bound to pay a dividend on preference shares if its profits in a particular year are insufficient it can postpone the dividend in case of cumulative preference shares also no fixed burden is created on its finances no interference generally preference shares do not carry voting rightstherefore a company can raise capital without dilution of control equity shareholders retain exclusive control over the company trading on equity the rate of dividend on preference shares is fixed therefore with the rise in its earnings the company can provide the benefits of trading on equity to the equity shareholders no charge on assets preference shares do not create any mortgage or charge on the assets of the company the company can keep its fixed assets free for raising loans in future variety different types of preference shares can be issued depending on the needs of investors participating preference shares or convertible preference shares may be issued to attract bold and enterprising investors countrybycountry perspectivesedit canadaedit preferred shares represent a significant portion of canadian capital markets with over c112 billion in new preferred shares issued in 201612 many canadian issuers are financial organizations which may count capital raised in the preferredshare market as tier 1 capital provided that the shares issued are perpetual another class of issuer includes split share corporations investors in canadian preferred shares are generally those who wish to hold fixedincome investments in a taxable portfolio preferential tax treatment of dividend income as opposed to interest income may in many cases result in a greater aftertax return than might be achieved with bonds preferred shares are often used by private corporations to achieve canadian tax objectives for instance the use of preferred shares can allow a business to accomplish an estate freeze by transferring common shares in exchange for fixedvalue preferred shares business owners can allow future gains in the value of the business to accrue to others such as a discretionary trust germanyedit the rights of holders of preference shares in germany are usually rather similar to those of ordinary shares except for some dividend preference and no voting right in many topics of shareholders meetings preference shares in german stock exchanges are usually indicated with v va or vz short for vorzugsaktie—for example bmw vz13—in contrast to st sta short for stammaktie or na short for namensaktie for standard shares14 preference shares with multiple voting rights eg at rwe or siemens have been abolished preferred stock may comprise up to half of total equity it is convertible into common stock but its conversion requires approval by a majority vote at the stockholders meeting if the vote passes german law requires consensus with preferred stockholders to convert their stock which is usually encouraged by offering a onetime premium to preferred stockholders the firms intention to do so may arise from its financial policy ie its ranking in a specific index industry stock indices usually do not consider preferred stock in determining the daily trading volume of a companys stock for example they do not qualify the company for a listing due to a low trading volume in common stocks14 united kingdomedit perpetual noncumulative preference shares may be included as tier 1 capital perpetual cumulative preferred shares are upper tier 2 capital dated preferred shares normally having an original maturity of at least five years may be included in lower tier 2 capital15 united statesedit in the united states the issuance of publicly listed preferred stock is generally limited to financial institutions reits and public utilities because in the us dividends on preferred stock are not taxdeductible at the corporate level in contrast to interest expense the effective cost of capital raised by preferred stock is 35 percent greater than issuing the equivalent amount of debt at the same interest rate this has led to the development of trups debt instruments with the same properties as preferred stock with the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in 2010 trups will be phased out as a vehicle for raising tier 1 capital by bank holding companies outstanding trups issues will be phased out completely by 201516 however with a qualified dividend tax of 15 percent compared to a top ordinary marginal tax rate of 35 percent17 1 of dividend income taxed at this rate provides the same aftertax income as approximately 130 in interest the size of the preferred stock market in the united states has been estimated as 100 billion as of early 2008update compared to 95 trillion for equities and us40 trillion for bonds18 the amount of new issuance in the united states was 341 billion in 201619 other countriesedit in nigeria preferred shares make up a small percentage of a companys stock with no voting rights except in cases were they are not paid dividends owners of preferred shares are entitled to a greater percentage of company profitscitation needed czech republic—preferred stock cannot be more than 50 percent of total equitycitation needed france—by a law enacted in june 2004 france allows the creation of preferred sharescitation needed south africa—dividends from preference shares are not taxable as income when held by individualscitation needed brazil—in brazil up to 50 percent of the capital stock of a company may be composed of preferred stock the preferred stock will have at least one less right than the common stock normally voting power but will have a preference in receiving dividendscitation needed russia—no more than 25 of capital may be preferred stock voting rights are limited but if dividends are not fully paid shareholders obtain full voting rightscitation needed notesedit drinkard t a primer on preferred
