protectorate of france in 1843–1844 and was later formed into a french colony in 1893 amid the european scramble for africa ivory coast achieved independence in 1960 led by félix houphouëtboigny who ruled the country until 1993 the country maintained close political and economic association with its west african neighbors while at the same time maintaining close ties to the west especially france since the end of houphouëtboignys rule in 1993 ivory coast has experienced one coup détat in 1999 and two religiongrounded civil wars the first took place between 2002 and 200710 and the second during

portuguese and french merchantexplorers in the 15th and 16th centuries divided the west coast of africa very roughly into five coasts reflecting local economies the coast that the french named the côte divoire and the portuguese named the costa do marfim—both literally being ivory coast—lay between what was known as the guiné de cabo verde socalled upper guinea at capvert and lower guinea1213 there was also a pepper coast also known as the grain coast a gold coast and a slave coast like those the name ivory coast reflected the major trade that occurred on that particular stretch of the coast the export of ivory1412151617 other names for the coast of ivory included the côte de dentsn 1 literally coast of teeth again reflecting the trade in ivory192014131721 the côte de quaqua after the people whom the dutch named the quaqua alternatively kwa kwa201218 the coast of the five and six stripes after a type of cotton fabric also traded there20 and the côte du ventn 2 the windward coast after perennial local offshore weather conditions1412 one can find the name cote des dents regularly used in older works20 it was used in ducketts dictionnaire duckett 1853 and by nicolas villault de bellefond for examples although antoine françois prévost used côte divoire21 in the 19th century usage switched to côte divoire20 the coastline of the modern state is not quite coterminous with what the 15th and 16thcentury merchants knew as the teeth or ivory coast which was considered to stretch from cape palmas to cape three points and which is thus now divided between the modern states of ghana and ivory coast with a minute portion of liberia19152118 it retained the name through french rule and independence in 196022 the name had long since been translated literally into other languagesn 3 which the postindependence government considered to be increasingly troublesome whenever its international dealings extended beyond the francophone sphere therefore in april 1986 the government declared côte divoire or more fully république de côte divoire24 to be its formal name for the purposes of diplomatic protocol and officially refuses to recognize or accept any translation from french to another language in its international dealings232526 despite the ivorian governments request the english translation ivory coast often the ivory coast is still frequently used in english by various media outlets and publicationsn 4n 5 historyedit main article history of ivory coast land migrationedit prehistoric polished stone celt from boundiali in northern ivory coast photo taken at the ifan museum of african arts in dakar senegal the first human presence in ivory coast has been difficult to determine because human remains have not been well preserved in the countrys humid climate however the presence of newly found weapon and tool fragments specifically polished axes cut through shale and remnants of cooking and fishing has been interpreted as a possible indication of a large human presence during the upper paleolithic period 15000 to 10000 bc35 or at the minimum the neolithic period36 the earliest known inhabitants of ivory coast have left traces scattered throughout the territory historians believe that they were all either displaced or absorbed by the ancestors of the present indigenous inhabitants who migrated south into the area before the 16th century such groups included the ehotilé aboisso kotrowou fresco zéhiri grand lahou ega and diès divo37 preislamic and islamic periodsedit the first recorded history is found in the chronicles of north african berber traders who from early roman times conducted a caravan trade across the sahara in salt slaves gold and other goods the southern terminals of the transsaharan trade routes were located on the edge of the desert and from there supplemental trade extended as far south as the edge of the rain forest the more important terminals—djenné gao and timbuctu—grew into major commercial centres around which the great sudanic empires developed by controlling the trade routes with their powerful military forces these empires were able to dominate neighbouring states the sudanic empires also became centres of islamic education islam had been introduced in the western sudan todays mali by muslim berber traders from north africa it spread rapidly after the conversion of many important rulers from the 11th century by which time the rulers of the sudanic empires had embraced islam it spread south into the northern areas of contemporary ivory coast the ghana empire the earliest of the sudanic empires flourished in presentday eastern mauritania from the fourth to the 13th centuries at the peak of its power in the 11th century its realms extended from the atlantic ocean to timbuctu after the decline of ghana the mali empire grew into a powerful muslim state which reached its apogee in the early part of the 14th century the territory of the mali empire in ivory coast was limited to the northwest corner around odienné its slow decline starting at the end of the 14th century followed internal discord and revolts by vassal states one of which songhai flourished as an empire between the 14th and 16th centuries songhai was also weakened by internal discord which led to factional warfare this discord spurred most of the migrations of peoples southward toward the forest belt the dense rain forest covering the southern half of the country created barriers to the largescale political organizations that had arisen in the north inhabitants lived in villages or clusters of villages their contacts with the outside world were filtered through longdistance traders villagers subsisted on agriculture and hunting preeuropean eraedit preeuropean kingdoms five important states flourished in ivory coast during the preeuropean era the muslim kong empire was established by the joola in the early 18th century in the northcentral region inhabited by the sénoufo who had fled islamization under the mali empire although kong became a prosperous center of agriculture trade and crafts ethnic diversity and religious discord gradually weakened the kingdom the city of kong was destroyed in 1895 by samori ture the abron kingdom of gyaaman was established in the 17th century by an akan group the abron who had fled the developing ashanti confederation of asanteman in what is presentday ghana from their settlement south of bondoukou the abron gradually extended their hegemony over the dyula people in bondoukou who were recent émigrés from the market city of begho bondoukou developed into a major center of commerce and islam the kingdoms quranic scholars attracted students from all parts of west africa in the mid17th century in eastcentral ivory coast other akan groups fleeing the asante established a baoulé kingdom at sakasso and two agni kingdoms indénié and sanwi the baoulé like the ashanti developed a highly centralized political and administrative structure under three successive rulers it finally split into smaller chiefdoms despite the breakup of their kingdom the baoulé strongly resisted french subjugation the descendants of the rulers of the agni kingdoms tried to retain their separate identity long after ivory coasts independence as late as 1969 the sanwi attempted to break away from ivory coast and form an independent kingdom38 the current king of sanwi is nana amon ndoufou v since 2002 establishment of french ruleedit compared to neighboring ghana ivory coast though practicing slavery and slave raiding suffered little from the slave trade as such european slaving and merchant ships preferred other areas along the coast with better harbors to trade with local slave owners the earliest recorded european voyage to west africa was made by the portuguese in 1482 the first west african french settlement saint louis was founded in the mid17th century in senegal while at about the same time the dutch ceded to the french a settlement at goree island off dakar a french mission was established in 1637 assinie near the border with the gold coast now ghana the europeans suppressed the local practice of slavery at this time and forbade the trade to their merchants assinies survival was precarious however the french were not firmly established in ivory coast until the mid19th century in 1843–4 french admiral bouëtwillaumez signed treaties with the kings of the grand bassam and assinie regions making their territories a french protectorate french explorers missionaries trading companies and soldiers gradually extended the area under french control inland from the lagoon region pacification was not accomplished until 1915 activity along the coast stimulated european interest in the interior especially along the two great rivers the senegal and the niger concerted french exploration of west africa began in the mid19th century but moved slowly based more on individual initiative than on government policy in the 1840s the french concluded a series of treaties with local west african chiefs that enabled the french to build fortified posts along the gulf of guinea to serve as permanent trading centres louisgustave binger of french west africa in 1892 treaty signing with famienkro leaders in presentday nzicomoé region ivory coast the first posts in ivory coast included one at assinie and another at grand bassam which became the colonys first capital the treaties provided for french sovereignty within the posts and for trading privileges in exchange for fees or coutumes paid annually to the local chiefs for the use of the land the arrangement was not entirely satisfactory to the french because trade was limited and misunderstandings over treaty obligations often arose nevertheless the french government maintained the treaties hoping to expand trade france also wanted to maintain a presence in the region to stem the increasing influence of the british along the gulf of guinea coast the french built naval bases to keep out nonfrench traders and began a systematic pacification of the interior to stop raids on their settlements they accomplished this only after a long war in the 1890s against mandinka tribesmen mostly from gambia however raids by the baoulé and other eastern tribes continued until 1917citation needed the defeat of france in the francoprussian war in 1871 and the subsequent annexation by germany of the french province of alsacelorraine caused the french government to abandon its colonial ambitions and withdraw its military garrisons from its french west african trading posts leaving them in the care of resident merchants the trading post at grand bassam in ivory coast was left in the care of a shipper from marseille arthur verdier who in 1878 was named resident of the establishment of ivory coast38 in 1886 to support its claims of effective occupation france again assumed direct control of its west african coastal trading posts and embarked on an accelerated program of exploration in the interior in 1887 lieutenant louis gustave binger began a twoyear journey that traversed parts of ivory coasts interior by the end of the journey he had concluded four treaties establishing french protectorates in ivory coast also in 1887 verdiers agent marcel treichlaplène negotiated five additional agreements that extended french influence from the headwaters of the niger river basin through ivory coast french colonial eraedit arrival in kong of new french west africa governor louisgustave binger in 1892 by the end of the 1880s france had established what came through for control over the coastal regions of ivory coast and in 1889 britain recognized french sovereignty in the area that same year france named trenchlaplène titular governor of the territory in 1893 ivory coast was made a french colony and then captain binger was appointed governor agreements with liberia in 1892 and with britain in 1893 determined the eastern and western boundaries of the colony but the northern boundary was not fixed until 1947 because of efforts by the french government to attach parts of upper volta presentday burkina faso and french sudan presentday mali to ivory coast for economic and administrative reasons frances main goal was to stimulate the production of exports coffee cocoa and palm oil crops were soon planted along the coast ivory coast stood out as the only west african country with a sizeable population of settlers elsewhere in west and central africa the french and british were largely bureaucrats as a result french citizens owned onethird of the cocoa coffee and banana plantations and adopted the local forcedlabor system throughout the early years of french rule french military contingents were sent inland to establish new posts some of the native population and former slaveowning class resisted french civilization and settlement among those offering greatest resistance was samori ture who in the 1880s and 1890s was conquering his neighbors reestablishing slavery and founding the wassoulou empire which extended over large parts of presentday guinea mali burkina faso and ivory coast samori tures large wellequipped army which could manufacture and repair its own firearms attracted some support throughout the region from chiefs who sought to play the two sides off against each other the french responded to samori tures expansion and conquest with military pressure french campaigns against samori ture which were met with greater resistance than usual in tribal warfare intensified in the mid1890s until he was captured in 1898 and his empire dissolved frances imposition of a head tax in 1900 to support the colony in a public works program provoked unexpected protests many ivoirians viewed the tax as a violation of the terms of the protectorate treaties because they imagined that france was demanding the equivalent of a coutume from the local kings rather than the reverse many of the population especially in the interior considered the tax a humiliating symbol of submission39 in 1905 the french officially abolished slavery in most of french west africa40 samori touré – founder and leader of the wassoulou empire a jihadist state in western africa that resisted french rule from 1904 to 1958 ivory coast was a constituent unit of the federation of french west africa it was a colony and an overseas territory under the third republic in world war i france organized regiments from ivory coast to fight in france and colony resources were rationed from 1917–1919 some 150000 men from ivory coast died in world war i until the period following world war ii governmental affairs in french west africa were administered from paris frances policy in west africa was reflected mainly in its philosophy of association meaning that all africans in ivory coast were officially french subjects but without rights to representation in africa or france french colonial policy incorporated concepts of assimilation and association based on an assumption of the superiority of french culture over all others in practice the assimilation policy meant the extension of french language institutions laws and customs to the colonies the policy of association also affirmed the superiority of the french in the colonies but it entailed different institutions and systems of laws for the colonizer and the colonized under this policy the africans in ivory coast were allowed to preserve their own customs insofar as they were compatible with french interests such as the recent abolition of the slave trade an indigenous elite trained in french administrative practice formed an intermediary group between the french and the africans assimilation was practiced in ivory coast to the extent that after 1930 a small number of westernized ivoirians were granted the right to apply for french citizenship most ivoirians however were classified as french subjects and were governed under the principle of association41 as subjects of france natives outside the abovementioned civilized elite had no political rights until they entered it they were drafted for work in mines on plantations as porters and on public projects as part of their tax responsibility they were expected to serve in the military and were subject to the indigénat a separate system of law42 in world war ii the vichy regime remained in control until 1942 when british troops invaded without much resistance winston churchill gave power back to members of general charles de gaulles provisional government by 1943 the allies had returned french west africa to the french the brazzaville conference of 1944 the first constituent assembly of the fourth republic in 1946 and frances gratitude for african loyalty during world war ii led to farreaching governmental reforms in 1946 french citizenship was granted to all african subjects the right to organize politically was recognized and various forms of forced labor were abolished until 1958 governors appointed in paris administered the colony of ivory coast using a system of direct centralized administration that left little room for ivoirian participation in policy making whereas british colonial administration adopted divideandrule policies elsewhere applying ideas of assimilation only to the educated elite the french were interested in ensuring that the small but influential elite was sufficiently satisfied with the status quo to refrain from any antifrench sentiment although strongly opposed to the practices of association educated ivoirians believed that they would achieve equality with their french peers through assimilation rather than through complete independence from france after the assimilation doctrine was implemented entirely through the postwar reforms though ivoirian leaders realized that even assimilation implied the superiority of the french over the ivoirians some of them thought that discrimination and political inequality would end only with independence others thought the problem of the division between the tribal culture and modernity would continue43 independenceedit president félix houphouëtboigny and first lady mariethérèse houphouëtboigny in the white house entrance hall with president john f kennedy and first lady jacqueline kennedy in 1962 félix houphouëtboigny the son of a baoulé chief became ivory coasts father of independence in 1944 he formed the countrys first agricultural trade union for african cocoa farmers like himself angered that colonial policy favoured french plantation owners they united to recruit migrant workers for their own farms houphouëtboigny soon rose to prominence and within a year was elected to the french parliament in paris a year later the french abolished forced labour houphouëtboigny established a strong relationship with the french government expressing a belief that the ivory coast would benefit from the relationship which it did for many years france appointed him as a minister the first african to become a minister in a european government a turning point in relations with france was reached with the 1956 overseas reform act loi cadre which transferred a number of powers from paris to elected territorial governments in french west africa and also removed the remaining voting inequalities in 1958 ivory coast became an autonomous member of the french community which had replaced the french union at the time of ivory coasts independence 1960 the country was easily french west africas most prosperous contributing over 40 of the regions total exports when houphouëtboigny became the first president his government gave farmers good prices for their products to further stimulate production this was further boosted by a significant immigration of workers from surrounding countries coffee production increased significantly catapulting ivory coast into third place in world output behind brazil and colombia by 1979 the country was the worlds leading producer of cocoa it also became africas leading exporter of pineapples and palm oil french technicians contributed to the ivoirian miracle in other african nations the people drove out the europeans following independence but in ivory coast they poured in the french community grew from only 30000 prior to independence to 60000 in 1980 most of them teachers managers and advisors44 for 20 years the economy maintained an annual growth rate of nearly 10—the highest of africas nonoilexporting countries houphouëtboigny administrationedit houphouëtboignys oneparty rule was not amenable to political competition laurent gbagbo who would become the president of ivory coast in 2000 had to flee the country in the 1980s as he incurred the ire of houphouëtboigny when gbagbo founded the front populaire ivoirien45 houphouëtboigny banked on his broad appeal to the population who continually elected him he was also criticized for his emphasis on developing largescale projects many felt the millions of dollars spent transforming his home village yamoussoukro into the new political capital were wasted others supported his vision to develop a centre for peace education and religion in the heart of the country in the early 1980s the world recession and a local drought sent shock waves through the ivoirian economy due to the overcutting of timber and collapsing sugar prices the countrys external debt increased threefold crime rose dramatically in abidjancitation needed in 1990 hundreds of civil servants went on strike joined by students protesting institutional corruption the unrest forced the government to support multiparty democracy houphouëtboigny became increasingly feeble and died in 1993 he favoured henri konan bédié as his successor bédié administrationedit in october 1995 bédié overwhelmingly won reelection against a fragmented and disorganised opposition he tightened his hold over political life jailing several hundred opposition supporters in contrast the economic outlook improved at least superficially with decreasing inflation and an attempt to remove foreign debt election results of 2002 in ivory coast unlike houphouëtboigny who was very careful in avoiding any ethnic conflict and left access to administrative positions open to immigrants from neighbouring countries bedié emphasized the concept of ivority ivoirité to exclude his rival alassane ouattara who had two northern ivorian parents from running for future presidential election as people originating from foreign countries are a large part of the ivoirian population this policy excluded many people from ivoirian nationality and the relationship between various ethnic groups became strained which resulted in two civil wars in the following decades 1999 coupedit similarly bedié excluded many potential opponents from the army in late 1999 a group of dissatisfied officers staged a military coup putting general robert guéï in power bedié fled into exile in france the new leadership reduced crime and corruption and the generals pressed for austerity and campaigned in the streets for a less wasteful society gbagbo administrationedit a presidential election was held in october 2000 in which laurent gbagbo vied with guéï but it was peaceful the leadup to the election was marked by military and civil unrest following a public uprising that resulted in around 180 deaths guéï was swiftly replaced by gbagbo alassane ouattara was disqualified by the countrys supreme court due to his alleged burkinabé nationality the existing and later reformed constitution under guéï did not allow noncitizens to run for the presidency this sparked violent protests in which his supporters mainly from the countrys north battled riot police in the capital yamoussoukro ivorian civil waredit main article first ivorian civil war a technical in the first ivorian civil war 2002–2007 in the early hours of 19 september 2002 while the president was in italy an armed uprising occurred troops who were to be demobilised mutinied launching attacks in several cities the battle for the main gendarmerie barracks in abidjan lasted until midmorning but by lunchtime the government forces had secured the main city abidjan they had lost control of the north of the country and the rebel forces made their stronghold in the northern city of bouaké the rebels threatened to move on abidjan again and france deployed troops from its base in the country to stop the rebel advance the french said they were protecting their own citizens from danger but their deployment also helped government forces that the french were helping either side was not established as a fact but each side accused the french of supporting the opposite side whether french actions improved or worsened the situation in the long term is disputed what exactly happened that night is disputed the government claimed that former president robert guéï led a coup attempt and state tv showed pictures of his dead body in the street counterclaims stated that he and 15 others had been murdered at his home and his body had been moved to the streets to incriminate him alassane ouattara took refuge in the german embassy his home had been burned down president gbagbo cut short his trip to italy and on his return stated in a television address that some of the rebels were hiding in the shanty towns where foreign migrant workers lived gendarmes and vigilantes bulldozed and burned homes by the thousands attacking the residents an early ceasefire with the rebels which had the backing of much of the northern populace proved shortlived and fighting over the prime cocoagrowing areas resumed france sent in troops to maintain the ceasefire boundaries46 and militias including warlords and fighters from liberia and sierra leone took advantage of the crisis to seize parts of the west 2002 unity governmentedit armed

patrolled the western border of the country the unity government was unstable and central problems remained with neither side achieving its goals in march 2004 120 people were killed in an opposition rally and subsequent mob violence led to the evacuation of foreign nationals a later report concluded the killings were planned though un peacekeepers were deployed to maintain a zone of confidence relations between gbagbo and the opposition continued to deteriorate early in november 2004 after the peace agreement had effectively collapsed following the rebels refusal to disarm gbagbo ordered airstrikes against the rebels during one of these airstrikes in bouaké on 6 november 2004 french soldiers were hit and nine were killed the ivorian government said it was a mistake but the french claimed it was deliberate they responded by destroying most ivoirian military aircraft two su25 planes and five helicopters and violent retaliatory riots against the french broke out in abidjan47 gbagbos original mandate as president expired on 30 october 2005 but due to the lack of disarmament holding an election was deemed impossible so his term in office was extended for a maximum of one year according to a plan worked out by the african union this plan was endorsed by the united nations security council48 with the lateoctober deadline approaching in 2006 the election was regarded as very unlikely to be held by that point and the opposition and the rebels rejected the possibility of another term extension for gbagbo49 the un security council endorsed another oneyear extension of gbagbos term on 1 november 2006 however the resolution provided for the strengthening of prime minister charles konan bannys powers gbagbo said the next day that elements of the resolution deemed to be constitutional violations would not be applied50 a peace accord between the government and the rebels or new forces was signed on 4 march 2007 and subsequently guillaume soro leader of the new forces became prime minister these events were seen by some observers as substantially strengthening gbagbos position51 according to unicef at the end of the civil war the water and sanitation

preliminary results announced independently by the president of the electoral commission from the headquarters of allasane due to concern about fraud in that commission they showed a loss for gbagbo in favour of his rival former prime minister alassane ouattara53 the ruling fpi contested the results before the constitutional council charging massive fraud in the northern departments controlled by the rebels of the new forces these charges were contradicted by united nations observers unlike african union observers the report of the results led to severe tension and violent incidents the constitutional council which consisted of gbagbo supporters declared the results of seven northern departments unlawful and that gbagbo had won the elections with 51 of the vote – instead of ouattara winning with 54 as reported by the electoral commission53 after the inauguration of gbagbo ouattara—who was recognized as the winner by most countries and the united nations—organized an alternative inauguration these events raised fears of a resurgence of the civil war thousands of refugees fled the country53 the african union sent thabo mbeki former president of south africa to mediate the conflict the united nations security council adopted a common resolution recognising alassane ouattara as winner of the elections based on the position of the economic community of west african states which suspended ivory coast from all its decisionmaking bodies54 while the african union also suspended the countrys membership55 in 2010 a colonel of the ivory coast armed forces nguessan yao was
