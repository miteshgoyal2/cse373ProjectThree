historyedit bank of italyedit main article bank of italy united states the history of bank of america dates back to october 17 19041 when amadeo pietro giannini founded the bank of italy in san francisco the bank of italy served the needs of many immigrants settling in the united states at that time providing services denied to them by the existing american banks which typically discriminated against them and often denied service to all but the wealthiest13 giannini was raised by his mother and stepfather lorenzo scatena as his father was fatally shot over a pay dispute with an employee14 when the 1906 san francisco earthquake struck giannini was able to save all deposits out of the bank building and away from the fires because san franciscos banks were in smoldering ruins and unable to open their vaults giannini was able to use the rescued funds to commence lending within a few days of the disaster from a makeshift desk consisting of a few planks over two barrels he lent money to those who wished to rebuild151617 in 1922 giannini established bank of america and italy in 1986 deutsche bank ag acquired 100 of banca damerica e ditalia a bank established in naples in 1917 following the namechange of banca dellitalia meridionale with the latter established in 1918 in 1918 another corporation bancitaly corporation was organized by a p giannini the largest stockholder of which was stockholders auxiliary corporation this company acquired the stocks of various banks located in new york city and certain foreign countries18 in 1928 giannini merged his bank with bank of america los angeles headed by orra e monnette and consolidated it with other bank holdings to create what would become the largest banking institution in the country bank of italy was renamed on november 3 1930 to bank of america national trust and savings association which was the only such designated bank in the united states of america at that time giannini and monnette headed the resulting company serving as cochairscitation needed expansion in californiaedit branch banking was introduced by giannini shortly after 1909 legislation in california that allowed for branch banking in the state its first branch outside san francisco was established in 1909 in san jose by 1929 the bank had 453 banking offices in california with aggregate resources of over us14 billion19 there is a replica of the 1909 bank of italy branch bank in history park in san jose and the 1925 bank of italy building is an important downtown landmark giannini sought to build a national bank expanding into most of the western states as well as into the insurance industry under the aegis of his holding company transamerica corporation in 1953 regulators succeeded in forcing the separation of transamerica corporation and bank of america under the clayton antitrust act20 the passage of the bank holding company act of 1956 prohibited banks from owning nonbanking subsidiaries such as insurance companies bank of america and transamerica were separated with the latter company continuing in the insurance business however federal banking regulators prohibited bank of americas interstate banking activity and bank of americas domestic banks outside california were forced into a separate company that eventually became first interstate bancorp later acquired by wells fargo and company in 1996 it was not until the 1980s with a change in federal banking legislation and regulation that bank of america was again able to expand its domestic consumer banking activity outside california new technologies also allowed credit cards to be linked directly to individual bank accounts in 1958 the bank introduced the bankamericard which changed its name to visa in 197721 a consortium of other california banks introduced master charge now mastercard to compete with bankamericard expansion outside californiaedit following the passage of the bank holding company act of 1956 bankamerica corporation was established for the purpose of owning and operation of bank of america and its subsidiaries bank of america expanded outside california in 1983 with its acquisition orchestrated in part by stephen mclin of seafirst corporation of seattle washington and its wholly owned banking subsidiary seattlefirst national bank seafirst was at risk of seizure by the federal government after becoming insolvent due to a series of bad loans to the oil industry bankamerica continued to operate its new subsidiary as seafirst rather than bank of america until the 1998 merger with nationsbank bankamerica experienced huge losses in 1986 and 1987 by the placement of a series of bad loans in the third world particularly in latin america the company fired its ceo sam armacost though armacost blamed the problems on his predecessor aw tom clausen clausen was appointed to replace armacost the losses resulted in a huge decline of bankamerica stock making it vulnerable to a hostile takeover first interstate bancorp of los angeles which had originated from banks once owned by bankamerica launched such a bid in the fall of 1986 although bankamerica rebuffed it mostly by selling operations it sold its financeamerica subsidiary to chrysler and the brokerage firm charles schwab and co back to mr schwab it also sold bank of america and italy to deutsche bank by the time of the 1987 stock market crash bankamericas share price had fallen to 8 but by 1992 it had rebounded mightily to become one of the biggest gainers of that halfdecade the bank of america tower in new york city bankamericas next big acquisition came in 1992 the company acquired its california rival security pacific corporation and its subsidiary security pacific national bank in california and other banks in arizona idaho oregon and washington which security pacific had acquired in a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s this was at the time the largest bank acquisition in history federal regulators however forced the sale of roughly half of security pacifics washington subsidiary the former rainier bank as the combination of seafirst and security pacific washington would have given bankamerica too large a share of the market in that state the washington branches were divided and sold to west one bancorp now us bancorp and keybank22 later that year bankamerica expanded into nevada by acquiring valley bank of nevada in 1994 bankamerica acquired the continental illinois national bank and trust co of chicago which had become federally owned as part of the same oil industry debacle emanating from oklahoma citys penn square bank that had brought down numerous financial institutions including seafirst at the time no bank possessed the resources to bail out continental so the federal government operated the bank for nearly a decade illinois at that time regulated branch banking extremely heavily so bank of america illinois was a singleunit bank until the 21st century bankamerica moved its national lending department to chicago in an effort to establish a financial beachhead in the region pyramidshaped former bank of america branch building towers over interstate 410 in san antonio texas these mergers helped bankamerica corporation to once again become the largest us bank holding company in terms of deposits but the company fell to second place in 1997 behind north carolinas fastgrowing nationsbank corporation and to third in 1998 first union corp on the capital markets side the acquisition of continental illinois helped bankamerica to build a leveraged finance origination and distribution business continental illinois had extensive leveraged lending relationships which allowed the firms existing brokerdealer bancamerica securities originally named ba securities to become a fullservice franchise2324 in addition in 1997 bankamerica acquired robertson stephens a san francisco–based investment bank specializing in high technology for 540 million robertson stephens was integrated into bancamerica securities and the combined subsidiary was renamed bancamerica robertson stephens25 merger of nationsbank and bankamericaedit logo of the former bank

2009 and a guarantee of 118 billion in potential losses at the company61 this was in addition to the 25 billion given to them in the fall of 2008 through tarp the additional payment was part of a deal with the us government to preserve bank of americas merger with the troubled investment firm merrill lynch62 since then members of the us congress have expressed considerable concern about how this money has been spent especially since some of the recipients have been accused of misusing the bailout money63 then ceo ken lewis was quoted as claiming we are still lending and we are lending far more because of the tarp program members of the us house of representatives however were skeptical and quoted many anecdotes about loan applicants particularly small business owners being denied loans and credit card holders facing stiffer terms on the debt in their card accounts according to a march 15 2009 article in the new york times bank of america received an additional 52 billion in government bailout money channeled through american international group64 as a result of its federal bailout and management problems the wall street journal reported that the bank of america was operating under a secret memorandum of understanding mou from the us government that requires it to overhaul its board and address perceived problems with risk and liquidity management with the

stabilize financial markets and we are pleased to be able to fully repay the investment with interest as americas largest bank we have a responsibility to make good on the taxpayers investment and our record shows that we have been able to fulfill that commitment while continuing to lend6667 bonus settlementedit on august 3 2009 bank of america agreed to pay a 33 million fine without admission or denial of charges to the us securities and exchange commission sec over the nondisclosure of an agreement to pay up to 58 billion of bonuses at merrill the bank approved the bonuses before the merger but did not disclose them to its shareholders when the shareholders were considering approving the merrill acquisition in december 2008 the issue was originally investigated by new york state attorney general andrew cuomo who commented after the suit and announced settlement that the timing of the bonuses as well as the disclosures relating to them constituted a surprising fit of corporate irresponsibility and our investigation of these and other matters pursuant to new yorks martin act will continue congressman kucinich commented at the same time that this may not be the last fine that bank of america pays for how it handled its merger of merrill lynch68 a federal judge jed rakoff in an unusual action refused to approve the settlement on august 569 a first hearing before the judge on august 10 was at times heated and he was sharply critical of the bonuses david rosenfeld represented the sec and lewis j liman son of arthur l liman represented the bank the actual amount of bonuses paid was 36 billion of which 850 million was guaranteed and the rest was shared amongst 39000 workers who received average payments of 91000 696 people received more than 1 million in bonuses at least one person received a more than 33 million bonus70 on september 14 the judge rejected the settlement and told the parties to prepare for trial to begin no later than february 1 2010 the judge focused much of his criticism on the fact that the fine in the case would be paid by the banks shareholders who were the ones that were supposed to have been injured by the lack of disclosure he wrote it is quite something else for the very management that is accused of having lied to its shareholders to determine how much of those victims’ money should be used to make the case against the management go away the proposed settlement the judge continued suggests a rather cynical relationship between the parties the sec gets to claim that it is exposing wrongdoing on the part of the bank of america in a highprofile merger the banks management gets to claim that they have been coerced into an onerous settlement by overzealous regulators and all this is done at the expense not only of the shareholders but also of the truth71 while ultimately deferring to the sec in february 2010 judge rakoff approved a revised settlement with a 150 million fine reluctantly calling the accord halfbaked justice at best and inadequate and misguided addressing one of the concerns he raised in september the fine will be distributed only to bank of america shareholders harmed by the nondisclosures or legacy shareholders an improvement on the prior 33 million while still paltry according to the judge case sec v bank of america corp 09cv06829 united states district court for the southern district of new york72 investigations also were held on this issue in the united states house committee on oversight and government reform71 under chairman edolphus towns dny73 and in its investigative domestic policy subcommittee under kucinich74 fraudedit in 2010 the bank was accused by the us government of defrauding schools hospitals and dozens of state and local government organizations via misconduct and illegal activities involving the investment of proceeds from municipal bond sales as a result the bank agreed to pay 1377 million including 25 million to the internal revenue service and 45 million to state attorney general to the affected organizations to settle the allegations75 former bank official douglas campbell pleaded guilty to antitrust conspiracy and wire fraud charges as of january 2011 other bankers and brokers are under indictment or investigation76 on october 24 2012 the top federal prosecutor in manhattan filed a lawsuit alleging that bank of america fraudulently cost american taxpayers more than 1 billion when countrywide financial sold toxic mortgages to fannie mae and freddie mac the scheme was called hustle or high speed swim lane7778 on may 23 2016 the second us circuit court of appeals ruled that the finding of fact by the jury that low quality mortgages were supplied by countrywide to fannie mae and freddie mac in the hustle case supported only intentional breach of contract not fraud the action for civil fraud relied on provisions of the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act the decision turned on lack of intent to defraud at the time the contract to supply mortgages was made79 downsizing 2011 to 2014edit during 2011 bank of america began conducting personnel reductions of an estimated 36000
