between the canadian province of quebec to the north and the us states of new york and vermont to the south the treaty of paris 1783edit the treaty of paris of 1783 ended the american revolutionary war between great britain and the united states in the second article of the treaty the parties agreed on all of the boundaries of the united states including but not limited to the boundary with british north america to the north the agreed boundary included the line from the northwest angle of nova scotia to the northwesternmost head of connecticut river and proceeded down along the middle of the river to the 45th parallel of north latitude that parallel had been established in the 1760s as the boundary between the provinces of quebec and new york including what later became the state of vermont it was surveyed and marked by john collins and thomas valentine in 1771–31 the st lawrence river and the great lakes became the boundary further west between what is now ontario and the united states northwest of lake superior the boundary followed rivers to the lake of the woods from the lake of the woods the boundary was agreed to go straight west until it met the mississippi river in fact that line never meets the river since the rivers source is further south the jay treaty 1794edit the jay treaty of 1794 effective 1796 created the international boundary commission which was charged with surveying and mapping the boundary it also provided for removal of british military and administration from detroit and other frontier outposts on the us side it was superseded by the treaty of ghent effective 1815 concluding the war of 1812 which included prewar boundaries rush–bagot treaty 1817edit the rush–bagot treaty of 1817 provided a plan for demilitarizing the two combatant sides in the war of 1812 and also laid out preliminary principles for drawing a border between british north america later canada and the united states the london convention 1818edit the 49th parallel north forms a border between the canadian provinces of british columbia alberta saskatchewan and manitoba to the north and the us states of washington idaho montana north dakota and minnesota to the south westward expansion of both british north america and the united states saw the boundary extended west along the 49th parallel from the northwest angle at lake of the woods to the rocky mountains under the treaty of 1818 that treaty extinguished british claims south of that latitude to the red river valley which was part of ruperts land the treaty also extinguished us claims to land north of that line in the watershed of the missouri river which was part of the louisiana purchase this amounted to three small areas consisting of the northern part of the drainages of the milk river today in southern alberta and southwestern saskatchewan the poplar river saskatchewan and big muddy creek saskatchewancitation needed along the 49th parallel the border vista is theoretically straight but in practice follows the 19thcentury surveyed border markers and varies by several hundred feet in spots2 webster–ashburton treaty 1842edit disputes over the interpretation of the border treaties and mistakes in surveying required additional negotiations resulting in the webster–ashburton treaty of 1842 the treaty resolved the dispute known as the aroostook war over the boundary between maine on the one hand and new brunswick and the province of canada on the other the treaty redefined the border between new hampshire vermont and new york on the one hand and the province of canada on the other resolving the indian stream dispute and the fort blunder dilemma at the outlet to lake champlain the part of the 45th parallel that separates quebec from the us states of vermont and new york had first been surveyed in 1771–3 after it had been declared the boundary between new york including what later became vermont and quebec and it was surveyed again after the war of 1812 the us government began to construct fortifications just south of the border at rouses point on lake champlain after a significant portion of the construction was completed measurements revealed that at that point the actual 45th parallel was threequarters of a mile 12 km south of the surveyed line the fort which became known as fort blunder was in canada this created a dilemma for the united states that was not resolved until a provision of the treaty left the border on the meandering line as surveyed the border along the boundary waters in presentday ontario and minnesota between lake superior and the northwest angle was also redefined34 the oregon treaty 1846edit main article oregon treaty an 1844 boundary dispute during us president james k polks administration led to a call for the northern boundary of the us west of the rockies to be latitude 54° 40 north related to the southern boundary of russias alaska territory but the united kingdom wanted a border that followed the columbia river to the pacific ocean the dispute was resolved in the oregon treaty of 1846 which established the 49th parallel as the boundary through the rockies the northwest boundary survey 1857–61edit boundary marker no1 on the 49th parallel north on the western shore of point roberts washington erected in 1861 the northwest boundary survey 1857–61 laid out the land boundary but the water boundary was not settled for some time after the pig war in 1859 arbitration in 1872 established the border between the gulf islands and the san juan islands the international boundary survey 1872–76edit the international boundary survey called the northern boundary survey in the united states began in 18725 its mandate was to establish the border as agreed to in the treaty of 1818 archibald campbell led the way for the united states donald cameron headed the british team this survey focused on the border from the lake of the woods to the summit of the rocky mountains6 the alaska boundary dispute 1903edit in 1903 a joint united kingdom – canada – us tribunal established the boundary of southeast alaska7 the treaty of 1908edit on april 11 1908 the united kingdom and the united states agreed under article iv of the treaty of 1908 to survey and delimit the boundary between canada and the united states through the st lawrence river and great lakes in accordance with modern surveying techniques and thus accomplished several changes to the border89 international boundary commission 1925edit for the bilateral commission concerning boundary waters use see international joint

boundary is commonly referred to as the worlds longest undefended border but this is true only in the military sense as civilian law enforcement is present it is illegal to cross the border outside

extensive tactical and strategic intelligence sharing as of december 2010update canada and the united states are negotiating an agreement titled beyond the border a shared vision for perimeter

backlash over his welcometocanada tweet alongside his sentiment of welcoming refugees fleeing terror persecution and violence into the country1819 trudeau later clarified that his tweet was in response to president of the united states donald trumps proposed travel ban on people from mostly muslim countries the prime minister then went on to say “you will not be at an advantage if you choose to enter canada irregularly you must follow the rules and there are many20 by the end of august trudeau stated that through additional staffing resources and expedited processes at the border the canadian government had taken control of the large increase in migrants coming across the border illegally21 smugglingedit a usbp agent armed with an m14 rifle tracking someone in harsh winter

true international exclave all potential paths of travel from the exclave to the home country must cross over only the territory of a different country or countries like exclaves practical exclaves are not contiguous with the land of the home country and have land access only through another country or countries unlike exclaves they are not entirely surrounded by foreign territory hence they are exclaves for practical purposes without meeting the strict definition the term peneexclave was defined in robinson 1959 as parts of the territory of one country that can be approached conveniently — in particular by wheeled traffic — only through the territory of another country34283 peneexclaves are also called functional exclaves or practical exclaves3531 thus a practical exclave has land borders with other territory but is not completely surrounded by the others land or territorial waters3660 catudal 197437113 and vinokurov 20073531–33 further elaborate upon examples including point roberts although physical connections by water with point roberts are entirely within the sovereignty of the united states land access is only possible through canada37 practical exclaves can exhibit
