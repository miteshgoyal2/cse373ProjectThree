historyedit main article history of software engineering when the first digital computers appeared in the early 1940s8 the instructions to make them operate were wired into the machine practitioners quickly realized that this design was not flexible and came up with the stored program architecture or von neumann architecture thus the division between hardware and software began with abstraction being used to deal with the complexity of computing programming languages started to appear in the early 1950scitation needed and this was also another major step in abstraction major languages such as fortran algol and cobol were released in the late 1950s to deal with scientific algorithmic and business problems respectively edsger w dijkstra wrote his seminal paper go to statement considered harmful9 in 1968 and david parnas introduced the key concept of modularity and information hiding in 197210 to help programmers deal with the ever increasing complexity of software systems the origins of the term software engineering have been attributed to different sources but it was used in 1968 as a title for the worlds first conference on software engineering sponsored and facilitated by nato the conference was attended by international experts on software who agreed on defining best practices for software grounded in the application of engineering the result of the conference is a report that defines how software should be developed the original report is publicly available11 the discipline of software engineering was created to address poor quality of software get projects exceeding time and budget under control and ensure that software is built systematically rigorously measurably on time on budget and within specification12 engineering already addresses all these issues hence the same principles used in engineering can be applied to software the widespread lack of best practices for software at the time was perceived as a software crisis131415 barry w boehm documented several key advances to the field in his 1981 book software engineering economics16 these include his constructive cost model cocomo which relates software development effort for a program in manyears t to source lines of code sloc t k ∗ s l o c 1 x displaystyle tksloc1x the book analyzes sixtythree software projects and concludes the cost of fixing errors escalates as the project moves toward field use the book also asserts that the key driver of software cost is the capability of the software development team in 1984 the software engineering institute sei was established as a federally funded research and development center headquartered on the campus of carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh pennsylvania united states watts humphrey founded the sei software process program aimed at understanding and managing the software engineering process his 1989 book managing the software process17 asserts that the software development process can and should be controlled measured and improved the process maturity levels introduced would become the capability maturity model integration for developmentcmmidev which has defined how the us government evaluates the abilities of a software development team modern generally accepted bestpractices for software engineering have been collected by the isoiec jtc 1sc 7 subcommittee and published as the software engineering body of knowledge swebok18 subdisciplinesedit software engineering can be divided into subdisciplines19 some of them are software requirements119 or requirements engineering the elicitation analysis specification and validation of requirements for software software design119 the process of defining the architecture components interfaces and other characteristics of a system or component it is also defined as the result of that process software construction119 the detailed creation of working meaningful software through a combination of coding verification unit testing integration testing and debugging software testing119 an empirical technical investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test software maintenance119 the totality of activities required to provide costeffective support to software software configuration management119 the identification of the configuration of a system at distinct points in time for the purpose of systematically controlling changes to the configuration and maintaining the integrity and traceability of the configuration throughout the system life cycle software engineering management119 the application of management activities—planning coordinating measuring monitoring controlling and reporting—to ensure that the development and maintenance of software is systematic disciplined and quantified software development process119 the definition implementation assessment measurement management change and improvement of the software life cycle process itself software engineering models and methods19 impose structure on software engineering with the goal of making that activity systematic repeatable and ultimately more successoriented software quality19 software engineering professional practice19 is concerned with the knowledge skills and attitudes that software engineers must possess to practice software engineering in a professional responsible and ethical manner software engineering economics19 is about making decisions related to software engineering in a business context computing foundations19 mathematical foundations19 engineering foundations19 educationedit knowledge of computer programming is a prerequisite for becoming a software engineer in 2004 the ieee computer society produced the swebok which has been published as isoiec technical report 19792004 describing the body of knowledge that they recommend to be mastered by a graduate software engineer with four years of experience20 many software engineers enter the profession by obtaining a university degree or training at a vocational school one standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees was defined by the ccse and updated in 200421 a number of universities have software engineering degree programs as of 2010update there were 244 campus bachelor of software engineering programs 70 online programs 230 masterslevel programs 41 doctoratelevel programs and 69 certificatelevel programs in the united states22 in addition to university education many companies sponsor internships for students wishing to pursue careers in information technology these internships can introduce the student to interesting realworld tasks that typical software engineers encounter every day similar experience can be gained through military service in software engineering professionedit main article software engineer legal requirements for the licensing or certification of professional software engineers vary around the world in the uk there is no licensing or legal requirement to assume or use the job title software engineer in some areas of canada such as alberta british columbia ontario23 and quebec software engineers can hold the professional engineer peng designation andor the information systems professional isp designation in canada there is a legal requirement to have peng when one wants to use the title engineer or practice software engineering in europe software engineers can obtain the european engineer eur ing professional title the united states starting from 2013 offers an ncees professional engineer exam for software engineering thereby allowing software engineers to be licensed and recognized24 mandatory licensing is currently still largely debated and perceived as controversial in some parts of the us such as texas the use of the term engineer is regulated by law and reserved only for use by individuals who have a professional engineer license the ieee computer society and the acm the two main usbased professional organizations of software engineering publish guides to the profession of software engineering the ieees guide to the software engineering body of knowledge 2004 version or swebok defines the field and describes the knowledge the ieee expects a practicing software engineer to have the most current swebok v3 is an updated version and was released in 201425 the ieee also promulgates a software engineering code of ethics26 employmentedit in november 2004 the u s bureau of labor statistics counted 760840 software engineers holding jobs in the us in the same time period there were some 14 million practitioners employed in the us in all other engineering disciplines combined27 due to its relative newness as a field of study formal education in software engineering is often taught as part of a computer science curriculum and many software engineers hold computer science degrees and have no engineering background whatsoever28 many software engineers work as employees or contractors software engineers work with businesses government agencies civilian or military and nonprofit organizations some software engineers work for themselves as freelancers some organizations have specialists to perform each of the tasks in the software development process other organizations require software engineers to do many or all of them in large projects people may specialize in only one role in small projects people may fill several or all roles at the same time specializations include in industry analysts architects developers testers technical support middleware analysts managers and in academia educators researchers most software engineers and programmers work 40 hours a week but about 15 percent of software engineers and 11 percent of programmers worked more than 50 hours a week in 2008 injuries in these occupations are rare however like other workers who spend long periods in front of a computer terminal typing at a keyboard engineers and programmers are susceptible to eyestrain back discomfort and hand and wrist problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome29 the fields future looks bright according to money magazine and salarycom which rated software engineer as the best job in the united states in 200630 in 2012 software engineering was again ranked as the best job in the united states this time by careercastcom31 certificationedit the software engineering institute offers certifications on specific topics like security process improvement and software architecture32 apple ibm microsoft and other companies also sponsor their own certification examinations many it certification programs are oriented toward specific technologies and managed by the vendors of these technologies33 these certification programs are tailored to the institutions that would employ people who use these technologies broader certification of general software engineering skills is available through various professional societies as of 2006update the ieee had certified over 575 software professionals as a certified software development professional csdp34 in 2008 they added an entrylevel certification known as the certified software development associate csda35 the acm had a professional certification program in the early 1980scitation needed which was discontinued due to lack of interest the acm examined the possibility of professional certification of software engineers in the late 1990s but eventually decided that such certification was inappropriate for the professional industrial practice of software engineering36 in the uk the british computer society has developed a legally recognized professional certification called chartered it professional citp available to fully qualified members mbcs software engineers may be eligible for membership of the institution of engineering and technology and so qualify for chartered engineer status in canada the canadian information processing society has developed a legally recognized professional certification called information systems professional isp37 in ontario canada software engineers who graduate from a canadian engineering accreditation board ceab accredited program successfully complete peos professional engineers ontario professional practice examination ppe and have at least 48 months of acceptable engineering experience are eligible to be licensed through the professional engineers ontario and can become professional engineers peng38 the peo does not recognize any online or distance education however and does not consider computer science programs to be equivalent to software engineering programs despite the tremendous overlap between the two this has sparked controversy and a certification war it has also held the number of peng holders for the profession exceptionally low the vast majority of working professionals in the field hold a degree in cs not se given the difficult certification path for holders of nonse degrees most never bother to pursue the license impact of globalizationedit the initial impact of outsourcing and the relatively lower cost of international human resources in developing third world countries led to a massive migration of software development activities from corporations in north america and europe to india and later china russia and other developing countries this approach had some flaws mainly the distance timezone difference that prevented human interaction between clients and developers and the massive job transfer this had a negative impact on many aspects of the software engineering profession for example some students in the developed world avoid education related to software engineering because of the fear of offshore outsourcing importing software products or services from other countries and of being displaced by foreign visa workers39 although statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself a related career computer programming does appear to have been affected4041 nevertheless the ability to smartly leverage offshore and nearshore resources via the followthesun workflow has improved the overall operational capability of many organizations42 when north americans are leaving work asians are just arriving to work when asians are leaving work europeans are arriving to work this provides a continuous ability to have human oversight on businesscritical processes 24 hours per day without paying overtime compensation or disrupting a key human resource sleep patterns while global outsourcing has several advantages global and generally distributed development can run into serious difficulties resulting from the distance between developers this is due to the key elements of this type of distance that have been identified as geographical temporal cultural and communication that includes the use of different languages and dialects of english in different locations43 research has been carried out in the area of global software development over the last 15 years and an extensive body of relevant work published that highlights the benefits and problems associated with the complex activity as with other aspects of software engineering research is ongoing in this and related areas related fieldsedit software engineering is a direct subfield of engineering and has an overlap with computer science and management sciencecitation needed it is also considered a part of overall systems engineering computer scienceedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it july 2017 in general software engineering focuses more on techniques for the application of software development in industry4445 while computer science focuses more on algorithms and theory46 controversyedit over definitionedit typical formal definitions of software engineering are the application of a systematic disciplined quantifiable approach to the development operation and maintenance of software5 an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production6 the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to economically obtain software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines7 the term has been used less formally as the informal contemporary term for the broad range of activities that were formerly called computer programming and systems analysis47 as the broad term for all aspects of the practice of computer programming as opposed to the theory of computer programming which is called computer science48 as the term embodying the advocacy of a specific approach to computer programming one that urges that it be treated as an engineering discipline rather than an art or a craft and advocates the codification of recommended practices49 criticismedit software engineering sees its practitioners as individuals who follow welldefined engineering approaches to problemsolving these approaches are specified in various software engineering books and research papers always with the connotations of predictability precision mitigated risk and professionalism this perspective has led to calls for licensing certification and codified bodies of knowledge as mechanisms for spreading the engineering knowledge and maturing the field software craftsmanship has been proposed by a body of software developers as an alternative that emphasizes the coding skills and accountability of the software developers themselves without professionalism or any prescribed curriculum leading to adhoc problemsolving craftmanship without engineering lack of predictability precision missing risk mitigation methods are informal and poorly defined the software craftsmanship manifesto extends the agile software manifesto50 and draws a metaphor between modern software development and the apprenticeship model of medieval europe software engineering extends engineering and draws on the engineering model ie engineering process engineering project management engineering requirements engineering design engineering construction and engineering validation the concept is so new that it is rarely understood and it is widely misinterpreted including in software engineering textbooks papers and among the communities of programmers and crafters one of the core issues in software engineering is that its approaches are not empirical enough because a realworld validation of approaches is usually absent or very limited and hence software engineering is often misinterpreted as feasible only in a theoretical environment dijkstra who developed computer languages in the 20th century refuted the concepts of software engineering that was prevalent thirty years ago in the 1980s arguing that those terms were poor analogies for what he called the radical novelty of computer science a number of these phenomena have been bundled under the name software engineering as economics is known as the miserable science software engineering should be known as the doomed discipline doomed because it cannot even approach its goal since its goal is selfcontradictory software engineering of course presents itself as another worthy cause but that is eyewash if you carefully read its literature and analyse what its devotees actually do you will discover that software engineering has accepted as its charter how to program if you cannot51 see alsoedit software portal software testing portal main article outline of software engineering bachelor of science in information technology bachelor of software engineering list of
