trace back to the foundation of major league soccer when the league decided to have a championship format similar to its contemporary north american sports leagues by having the season culminate in a postseason tournament to determine the league champion for the first few mls cup finals the championship was dominated by dc united who appeared in the first four mls cup finals winning three of them the inaugural mls cup mls cup 96 was the first mls cup championship match featuring united and los angeles galaxy the inaugural match had the galaxy take an early 1–0 lead and double in early in the second half however their lead was relinquished towards the end of the match when tony sanneh pulled one back in the 72nd minute nine minutes later shawn medved tied the match at two resulting in overtime between the two sides four minutes into overtime eddie pope gave united the golden goal victory in 1997 the second league cup final was contested at rfk stadium where united won backtoback titles a feat that would not be accomplished for another decade when houston dynamo won the 2006 and 2007 finals the game ended 2–1 in uniteds favor over colorado rapids who would not win a championship until 2010 jaime moreno was declared man of the match for his goal in the 37th minute of play this season was also the first time in league history any mls team won the regular season supporters shield and postseason title in the same season dc uniteds run ended the third year when they made a third run to the mls cup finals only to lose to the expansionside chicago fire by 20 however the following year united repeated their double of winning both the supporters shield and mls cup the same season this time it was a 2–0 win over the galaxy in the 1999 mls cup final rise of the california clásicoedit for the first time since 1997 the 2000 mls cup final saw a new club reach the finals along with the fire this time the kansas city wizards won their first mls cup with a 1–0 victory over the fire landon donovan of san jose defending chicagos carlos bocanegra in the 2003 mls cup from 2001 through 2004 the mls cup finals saw a rising of the california clásico when stateside rivals la galaxy and san jose earthquakes clashed together in the 2001 final the match also saw the rise of us national landon donovan who won a newcomer of the year award and tallied the equalizer in the earthquakes 2–1 championship victory over the galaxy with the largest crowd in mls cup history at hand the new england revolution took on the galaxy in the 2002 finals for the match over 61000 fans were in attendance at gillette stadium to witness the final in the second period of suddendeath overtime the galaxy nabbed their first mls cup title and sparked the start of a string of mls cup losses for the revolution the 2003 final saw the league leaders for that season go headtohead two clubs that had mls cup experience the fire and earthquakes played for the final that year the two clubs had successful regular season campaigns with the fire winning their first ever supporters shield and the earthquakes being the western conference regular season and postseason champions as well as having the second best overall regular season record in a hotly contested match the earthquakes won with their second mls cup title with a 4–2 score making it the highest scoring mls cup final in league history six goals after a fouryear absence united made their fifth trip to the mls cup final playing against the wizards for mls cup 2004 the match had four goals scored in the first 25 minutes with united rallying for a 3–1 lead midway through the second half united had relinquished a penalty kick josh wolff scored for kansas city bringing the game within a goal dc united was able to retain the lead by winning their fourth mls cup title by a score of 3–2 format changesedit until 2005 the mls cup championship games had been dominated by clubs that had either won or had come close to winning the supporters shield in the 2005 mls cup championship the match was won by the los angeles galaxy who won the league title by having a 9thplace overall record3 consequently the wizards had a better record but did not qualify for the playoffs because they finished 5th in the eastern conference in spite of an 8thplace overall record3 the result prompted mls to create new wildcards that were used starting in 2006 where only a certain number of clubs per conference could qualify and the next best overall teams regardless of conference would also qualify that in itself prompted debates about the league switching to a single table and a balanced schedule the single table has yet been instituted but in 2010 the league instituted a balanced schedule4 scudettoedit second mls scudetto 2008–2012 at the start of the 2006 season mls created their version of the scudetto italian for small shield a symbol worn on the jersey by the team who won the previous seasons serie a the top italian league the mls scudetto was originally a curved triangular badge featuring a backdrop of the american flag behind a replica of the alan i rothenberg mls cup trophy first worn by los angeles galaxy in 2006 following their 2005 mls cup title5 the houston dynamo wore the same triangular scudettos in 2007 and 2008 during their dualcup run it was redesigned after the 2008 season after the change to the mls cup trophy it is now an ovalshaped black badge with the philip f anschutz trophy in the middle the mls scudetto is worn by the winning team the season following the victory it is only during the subsequent season two years after winning the championship that the team adds a star — a common soccer signifier of titles won — above the team logo the team can display the star on other items beside their jersey in the year after winning the cup but only if the scudetto is not shown the columbus crew was the first team to wear the redesigned scudetto real salt lake would wear the scudetto in 2010 after winning their first mls cup in 2009 a year after the colorado rapids would also wear the scudetto after their cup run in 2010 for the 2011 season finally the los angeles galaxy would wear the scudetto after winning the mls cup in 2011 ironically it would be the last team to wear the redesigned scudetto after the 2012 season mls decided not to use the scudetto for upcoming season and instead the defending mls cup champions would have a gold star above one or more silver stars indication the teams mls cup wins followed by an additional silver star added to the lined stars the following season the los angeles galaxy were the first to receive the gold star above the teams three silver stars for the 2013 season buffalo bills of mlsedit whilst the galaxy earned their second mls cup trophy and the houston dynamo earned consecutive cups the new england revolution went on a run of making three consecutive mls cup finals losing all of them two of their three losses were in extra time while the other was lost on penalty kicks the infamy gave the club the title of being the buffalo bills an nfl american football team of mls6 this was in reference to the buffalo bills super bowl runs in the early 1990s and they lost in every single appearance in the 2005 final they lost to the los angeles galaxy a rematch of 2002 in the final held at pizza hut park now toyota stadium in frisco texas the galaxy defeated the revolution by a score of 1–0 thanks to a 105thminute overtime goal from galaxy midfielder and guatemalan international guillermo ramírez ramírezs goal sealed the galaxys second mls cup title and left the revs searching once again in 2006 the championship was once again played in frisco at pizza hut park this time the revolution took on the houston dynamo both were coming off a successful season in which they fell short of winning the supporters shield a sellout crowd of 22427 attended the match which is to date the largest crowd in the stadiums historycitation needed revolution forward taylor twellman scored an overtime goal in the 113th minute to give the revolution the 1–0 lead however dynamo captain and forward brian ching immediately tied the score following the revolutions goal the match went to penalties in which the dynamo won 4–3 this left the revolution for a secondconsecutive year searching for league glory it was also the first time in league history that a club made the mls cup final and lost consecutively7 in the 2007 final the revolution and dynamo played each other once again for the 2007 cup played in washington dc at rfk stadium a crowd just shy of 40000 witnessed the championship7 the announced crowd of 39859 made it the largest mls cup crowd since 2002citation needed the revolution had a successful season earning their first us open cup title the revolution wanted their first ever mls cup crown and wanted to win their first ever double in club history houston finishing just shy once again to dc united of winning the mls supporters shield were determined to finish their second season with some hardware and to defend their mls cup title7 the match went in the revolutions favor early on as the revolutions captain twellman netted in the 20th minute to give new england a 1–0 lead however midway through the second half the dynamo retaliated dynamo striker joseph ngwenya leveled things at one apiece in the 61st minute and mls cup man of the match dwayne de rosario gave the dynamo a 2–1 lead in the 74th7 the goal also proved to be the winning goal as the dynamo earned the first backtoback mls cup titles since dc united in 1996 and 19977 underdogs winning the cupedit held at seattles centurylink field then qwest field real salt lake defeated la galaxy in mls cup 2009 to win their first championship early in the 2008 major league soccer season the league announced that the championship would be returning to the home depot center throughout the regular season the league was dominated by the columbus crew who finished the season with 57 points and secured the supporters shield title with three matches remaining before the 2008 mls cup playoffs traditionally the shield winners only rarely made it to the league championship in spite of usually being the heavy favorites going into the playoffs however for the first time in eight years a regular season champion made it to the mls cup final the sigi schmidled club made their first ever run to the championship along with their opponents the new york red bulls for the crew being the shield winners their run to the final was a bit expected the red bulls making the final was seen as a large surprise possibly even a fluke the red bulls did not qualify for the playoffs until the last day of the season where they were the weakest team in terms of regular season record to qualify for the playoffs the match ended up being dominated by the crew as columbus defeated new york with ease 3–1 the point gap between the two clubs was the largest in history and the scoreline between the two clubs made it tied for the largest margin of victory in mls cup history new yorks run to the finals was further emphasized as a fluke when the club had the worst record in 2009 the following championship saw two intraconference clubs meet in the final for the second consecutive year this time in seattles qwest field now centurylink field the western conference regular season and postseason champions los angeles galaxy took on real salt lake who finished fifth in the west although the sounders fc management had originally planned on capping the seats available in qwest field to 35700 surging demand led to the release of an additional 10000 seats expanding the total capacity to roughly 45700 the announced crowd was 46011 the crowd size was the first championship crowd since 2002 to draw over 45000 spectators televised on espn it was the first time that the mls championship match was televised on the cable network the first thirteen were carried on abc in the 41st minute galaxy striker mike magee scored only for salt lakes robbie findley to make the tying goal in the 61st the stalemate was not broken in regulation nor overtime requiring penalty kicks to decide the match thanks to a strike from salt lakes robbie russell salt lake won their first major trophy by winning the championship they gained entry into the 2010–11 concacaf champions league there they made it to the final only to lose to monterrey of mexico at the 2010 seasons end six teams from the western conference qualified for the playoffs whereas only two clubs from the east qualified making it the largest disparity between the two conferences in league history the leagues seeding at the time awarded conference winners earned the top seeds the two weakest western conference teams san jose earthquakes and colorado rapids were seeded against the eastern conference champion new york red bulls and runnerup columbus crew respectively some cited this as an unfair advantage for the rapids and earthquakes as both teams made the semifinals in the end the rapids played fc dallas for mls cup 2010 winning 2–1 in overtime galaxy dynastyedit la galaxy captain robbie keane was the 2014 mls cup mvp between the 2011 and 2014 mls cups the la galaxy appeared in three mls cup finals winning every single final having the most success in mls cup in a short period of time since uniteds late 1990s dynasty the only final that the galaxy did not win came in 2013 where they lost in the 2013 western conference finals to eventual runnerup real salt lake during that time the galaxy became the first mls franchise to win five mls cups when they won mls cup 2014 these teams contained several highprofile players including donovan robbie keane gyasi zardes david beckham and omar gonzalez some claim that the galaxys dynasty began in 2009 when they reached the playoffs for the first time since 2005 and marched to the finals only to lose on penalties to real salt lake in 2010 and again in 2011 the galaxy won consecutive supporters shield and completed the league double winning both the shield and mls cup in 2011 this was the first time this had been accomplished since the columbus crew achieved it in 2008 in the 2011 mls cup final the galaxy defeated the houston dynamo 1–0 off a 72nd minute donovan goal the goal was scored off a galaxy counter where beckham fed a through ball to donovan who slotted it past hall the 2012 final featured both the galaxy and dynamo again making it the first since 2007 that an mls cup final was a rematch of the previous final again the galaxy won the final this time coming from behind to defeat the dynamo by a 3–1 scoreline the match was beckhams final mls match during the 2013 season the galaxys chance to threepeat was thwarted by real salt lake salt lake defeated the galaxy 2–1 on aggregate to advance to the mls cup final where they eventually lost to sporting kansas city
