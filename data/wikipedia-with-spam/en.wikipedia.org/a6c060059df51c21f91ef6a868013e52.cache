washingtons maze of highpowered k street lobbyist and law firm office buildings lobbying in the united states describes paid activity in which special interests hire wellconnected professional advocates often lawyers to argue for specific legislation in decisionmaking bodies such as the united states congress it is a highly controversial phenomenon often seen in a negative light by journalists and the american public1 with some critics describing it as a legal form of bribery or extortion23 while lobbying is subject to extensive and often complex rules which if not followed can lead to penalties including jail the activity of lobbying has been interpreted by court rulings as constitutionally protected free speech and a way to petition the government for the redress of grievances two of the freedoms protected by the first amendment of the constitution since the 1970s lobbying activity has grown immensely in the united states in terms of the numbers of lobbyists and the size of lobbying budgets and has become the focus of much criticism of american governance it is possible for foreign nations to hire american lobbyists to influence the foreign policy of the united states for example in 2016 taiwanese officials hired american senatorturnedlobbyist bob dole to set up a controversial phone call between presidentelect donald trump and taiwanese president tsai ingwen a move marking a shift in us foreign policy456 since lobbying rules require extensive disclosure there is a large amount of information in the public sphere about which entities lobby how at whom and for how much the current pattern suggests much lobbying is done primarily by corporations although a wide variety of coalitions representing diverse groups also occurs lobbying takes place at every level of government including federal state county municipal and even local governments in washington dc lobbying usually targets members of congress although there have been efforts to influence executive agency officials as well as supreme court appointments lobbying can have an important influence on the political system for example a study in 2014 suggested that special interest lobbying enhanced the power of elite groups and was a factor shifting the nations political structure toward an oligarchy in which average citizens have little or no independent influence7 while the number of lobbyists in washington is estimated to be over twelve thousand those with real clout number in the dozens and a small group of firms handles much of lobbying in terms of expenditures8 a report in the nation in 2014 suggested that while the number of 12281 registered lobbyists was a decrease since 2002 lobbying activity was increasing and going underground as lobbyists use increasingly sophisticated strategies to obscure their activity9 analyst james a thurber estimated that the actual number of working lobbyists was close to 100000 and that the industry brings in 9 billion annually9 lobbying has been the subject of academic inquiry in various fields including law public policy and economics contents 1 overview 2 different types of lobbying 21 the focus of

notes 10 further reading 11 external links overviewedit political scientist thomas r dye once said that politics is about battling over scarce governmental resources who gets them where when why and how10 since government makes the rules in a complex economy such as the united states it is logical that various organizations businesses individuals nonprofits trade groups religions charities and others—which are affected by these rules—will exert as much influence as they can to have rulings favorable to their cause and the battling for influence has happened in every organized society since the beginning of civilization whether it was ancient athens florence during the time of the medici late imperial china or the presentday united states modernday lobbyists in one sense are like the courtiers of the ancien régime if voting is a general way for a public to control a government lobbying is a more specific targeted effort focused on a narrower set of issues1 the lobby of the house of commons painting 1886 by liborio prosperi the term lobby has etymological roots in the physical structure of the british parliament in which there was an intermediary covered room outside the main hall people pushing an agenda would try to meet with members of parliament in this room and they came to be known by metonymy as lobbyists although one account in 1890 suggested that the application of the word lobby is american and that the term is not used as much in britain11 the term lobbying in everyday parlance can describe a wide variety of activities and in its general sense suggests advocacy advertising or promoting a cause in this sense anybody who tries to influence any political position can be thought of as lobbying and sometimes the term is used in this loose sense a person who writes a letter to a congressperson or even questions a candidate at a political meeting could be construed as being a lobbyist112 however the term lobbying generally means a paid activity with the purpose of attempting to influence or sway a public official – including bureaucrats and elected officials – towards a desired specific action often relating to specific legislation13 if advocacy is disseminating information including attempts to persuade public officials as well as the public and media to promote the cause of something and support it13 then when this activity becomes focused on specific legislation either in support or in opposition then it crosses the line from advocacy and becomes lobbying13 this is the usual sense of the term lobbying one account suggested that much of the activity of nonprofits was not lobbying per se since it usually did not mean changes in legislation13dubious – discuss a lobbyist according to the legal sense of the word is a professional often a lawyer lobbyists are intermediaries between client organizations and lawmakers they explain to legislators what their organizations want and they explain to their clients what obstacles elected officials face one definition of a lobbyist is someone employed to persuade legislators to pass legislation that will help the lobbyists employer14 many lobbyists work in lobbying firms or law firms some of which retain clients outside lobbying others work for advocacy groups trade associations companies and state and local governments lobbyists can be one type of government official such as a governor of a state who presses officials in washington for specific legislation15 a lobbyist may put together a diverse coalition of organizations and people sometimes including lawmakers and corporations and the whole effort may be considered to be a lobby for example in the abortion issue there is a prochoice lobby and a prolife lobby an estimate from 2007 reported that more than 15000 federal lobbyists were based in washington dc16 another estimate from 2011 suggested that the count of registered lobbyists who have actually lobbied was closer to 1200017 while numbers like these suggest that lobbying is a widespread activity most accounts suggest that the washington lobbying industry is an exclusive one run by a few wellconnected firms and players with serious barriers to entry for firms wanting to get into the lobbying business since it requires them to have been roaming the halls of congress for years and years8 different types of lobbyingedit the focus of lobbying effortsedit lobbying depends on cultivating personal relationships over many years photo lobbyist tony podesta left with former senator kay hagan center and her husband generally lobbyists focus on trying to persuade decisionmakers congress executive branch agencies such as the treasury department and the securities and exchange commission18 the supreme court19 and state governments including governors federal agencies have been targeted by lobbyists since they write industryspecific rules accordingly interest groups spend massive sums of money trying to persuade them to make socalled carveouts or try to block specific provisions from being enacted20 a large fraction of overall lobbying is focused on only a few sets of issues according to one report21 it is possible for one level of government to lobby another level for example the district of columbia has been lobbying congress and the president for greater power including possible statehood or voting representation in congress one assessment in 2011 suggested that the district needed to rethink its lobbying strategy since its past efforts have only had mixed results22 many executive branch agencies have the power to write specific rules and are a target of lobbying federal agencies such as the state department make rules such as giving aid money to countries such as egypt and in one example an egyptianamerican businessman named kais menoufy organized a lobby to try to halt us aid to egypt23 since the supreme court has the power of judicial review and can render a congressional law unconstitutional it has great power to influence the course of american life for example in the roe v wade decision it ruled on the legality of abortion a variety of forces use lobbying tactics to pressure the court to overturn this decision lobbyists represent their clients or organizations interests in state capitols an example is a former school superintendent who has been lobbying state legislatures in california michigan and nevada to overhaul teacher evaluations and trying to end the last in first out teacher hiring processes according to one report michelle rhee is becoming a political force24 state governments can be lobbied by groups which represent other governments within the state such as a city authority for example the cities of tallahassee25 and st petersburg26 lobbied the florida legislature using paid lobbyists to represent the citys interests there is lobbying activity at the county27 and municipal levels especially in larger cities and populous counties for example officials within the city government of chicago called aldermen became lobbyists after serving in municipal government following a oneyear period required by city ethics rules to abstain from lobbying28 paid versus free lobbyingedit while the bulk of lobbying happens by business and professional interests who hire paid professionals some lobbyists represent nonprofits probono for issues in which they are personally interested pro bono publico clients offer activities to meet and socialize with local legislators at events like fundraisers and awards ceremonies single issue versus multiple issue lobbyingedit lobbies which push for a single issue have grown in importance during the past twenty years according to one source12 corporations generally would be considered as single issue lobbies if a corporation wishes to change public policy or to influence legislation which impacts its success as a business it may use lobbying as a primary avenue for this purpose29 one research study suggested that single issue lobbies often operate in different kinds of institutional venues sometimes bringing the same message to different groups30 lobbies which represent groups such as labor unions business organizations trade associations and such are sometimes considered to be multiple issue lobbies and to succeed they must be somewhat more flexible politically and be willing to accept compromise12 inside versus outside lobbyingedit inside lobbying or sometimes called direct lobbying describes efforts by lobbyists to influence legislation or rulemaking directly by contacting legislators and their assistants sometimes called staffers or aides outside lobbying or sometimes indirect lobbying includes attempts by interest group leaders to mobilize citizens outside the policymaking community perhaps by public relations methods or advertising to prompt them to pressure public officials within the policymaking community31 one example of an outside lobbying effort is a film entitled injustice made by a group promoting lawsuit reform32 some lobbyists are now are using social media to reduce the cost of traditional campaigns and to more precisely target public officials with political messages33 history of lobbyingedit main article history of lobbying in the united states the federalist papers in which framers madison hamilton and jay strove to sway public opinion could be considered according to current usage as an outside lobbying effort the constitution was crafted in part to solve the problem of special interests today usually represented by lobbies by having these factions compete james madison identified a faction as a number of citizens whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion or of interest adverse to the rights of other citizens or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community1 and madison argued in federalist no 10 that there was less risk of injury by a narrowly focused faction in a large republic if any negative influence was counteracted by other factions23 in addition the constitution protected free speech including the right to petition the government1234 and these rights have been used by lobbying interests throughout the nations history there has been lobbying at every level of government particularly in state governments35 during the nineteenth century but increasingly directed towards the federal government in the twentieth century the last few decades have been marked by an exponential increase in lobbying activity and expenditures36 lobbying as a businessedit key playersedit lobbyistsedit the number of registered washington lobbyists is substantial in 2009 the washington post estimated that there were 13700 registered lobbyists describing the nations capitol as teeming with lobbyists8 in 2011 the guardian estimated that in addition to the approximately 13000 registered lobbyists thousands more unregistered lobbyists could exist in washington37 the ratio of lobbyists employed by the healthcare industry compared with every elected politician was six to one according to one account37 nevertheless the numbers of lobbyists actively engaged in lobbying is considerably less and the ones occupied with lobbying fulltime and making significant money is even less law firms several law firms including patton boggs akin gump and holland knight had sizable departments devoted to socalled government relations38 one account suggested that the lobbying arms of these law firms were not held as separate subsidiaries but that the law practices involved in government lobbying were integrated into the overall framework of the law firm38 a benefit to an integrated arrangement was that the law firm and the lobbying department could share and refer clients back and forth38 holland knight earned 139 million from lobbying revenue in 201139 one law firm employs socalled power brokers including former treasury department officials such as marti thomas and former presidential advisers such as daniel meyer40 there was a report that two law firms were treating their lobbying groups as separate business units and giving the nonlawyer lobbyists an equity stake in the firm38 lobbying firms these firms usually have some lawyers in them and are often founded by former congressional staffers legislators or other politicianscitation needed some lobbying groups have been bought by large advertising conglomerates36 defense contractors such as boeing and lockheed martin sell extensively to the government and must of necessity engage in lobbying to win contracts corporationsedit corporations which lobby actively tend to be few in number large and often sell to the government most corporations do not hire lobbyists8 one study found that the actual number of firms which do lobbying regularly is fewer than 300 and that the percent of firms engaged in lobbying was 10 from 1998 to 200629 and that they were mainly large rich firms getting in on the fun8 these firms hired lobbyists year after year and there was not much evidence of other large firms taking much interest in lobbying8 corporations considering lobbying run into substantial barriers to entry corporations have to research the relevant laws about lobbying hire lobbying firms and cultivate influential people and make connections8414243 when an issue regarding a change in immigration policy arose large corporations currently lobbying switched focus somewhat to take account of the new regulatory world but new corporations—even ones likely to be affected by any possible rulings on immigration—stayed out of the lobbying fray according to the study29 still of all the entities doing lobbying in washington the biggest overall spenders are in fact corporations in the first decade of the 2000s the most lucrative clients for gerald cassidys lobbying firm were corporations displacing fees from the appropriations business36 wall street lobbyists and the financial industry spent upwards of 100 million in one year to court regulators and lawmakers particularly since they were finalizing new regulations for lending trading and debit card fees44 one academic analysis in 1987 found that firms were more likely to spend on lobbying if they were both large and concerned about adverse financial statement consequences if they did not lobby45 big banks were prolific spenders on lobbying jpmorgan chase has an inhouse team of lobbyists who spent 33 million in 201044 the american bankers association spent 46 million on lobbying44 an organization representing 100 of the nations largest financial firms called the financial services roundtable spent heavily as well44 a trade group representing hedge funds spent more than 1 million in one quarter trying to influence the government about financial regulations including an effort to try to change a rule that might demand greater disclosure requirements for funds18 amazoncom spent 450000 in one quarter lobbying about a possible online sales tax as well as rules about data protection and privacy46 corporations which sell substantially to the government tend to be active lobbiers for example aircraft manufacturer boeing which has sizeable defense contracts pours millions into lobbying47 boeing co is one of the most influential companies in airline manufacturing and has continually shown its influence in lobbying congress between january and september boeing spent a total of 12 million lobbying according to research by the center for responsive politics additionally boeing has its own political action committee which donated more than 22 million to federal candidates during the 2010 election cycle of that sum 53 percent went to democrats through september boeings pac has donated 748000 to federal politicians — chicago suntimes quoting opensecretsorg 201147 credit reporting agency equifax lobbied

lobbying arena are those who might influence legislation house senate colleagues public opinion in the district the white house party leaders union leaders and other influential persons and groups31 interest groups are often thought of as nonparty organizations which regularly try to change or influence government decisionmaking31 lobbying methods and techniquesedit lobbying has much in common with highly peopleintensive businesses such as management consulting and public relations but with a political and legal sensibility like lawmakers many lobbyists are lawyers and the persons they are trying to influence have the duty of writing laws that the disciplines of law and lobbying are intertwined could be seen in the case of a texas lawyer who had been seeking compensation for his unfairly imprisoned client since his exoneratedprisoner client had trouble paying the legal expenses the lawyer lobbied the texas state legislature to raise the states payment for unfairly imprisoned prisoners from 50000 per year to 80000 per year it succeeded making it possible for his newly freed client to pay the lawyers fees51 connections count congressman tom perriello with lobbyist heather podesta at an inauguration party for barack obama wellconnected lobbyists work in washington for years know the issues are highly skilled advocates52 and have cultivated close connections with members of congress regulators specialists and others they understand strategy and have excellent communication skills many are well suited to be able to choose which clients they would like to represent52 lobbyists patiently cultivate networks of powerful people over many years trying to build trust and maintain confidence and friendships when a client hires them to push a specific issue or agenda they usually form coalitions to exert political pressure12 lobbying as a result depends on trying to be flexible to new opportunities but at the same time to act as an agent for a client as one lobbyist put it its my job to advance the interests of my association or client period — comment by a lobbyist52 access is important and often means a oneonone meeting with a legislator53 getting access can sometimes be difficult but there are various avenues email personal letters phone calls facetoface meetings meals gettogethers and even chasing after congresspersons in the capitol building my style of lobbying is not to have big formal meetings but to catch members on the fly as theyre walking between the house and the office buildings — a lobbyist commenting on access52 when getting access is difficult there are ways to wear down the walls surrounding a legislator jack abramoff explained access is vital in lobbying if you cant get in your door you cant make your case here we had a hostile senator whose staff was hostile and we had to get in so thats the lobbyist safecracker method throw fundraisers raise money and become a big donor — lobbyist jack abramoff in 201154 lobbyists often assist congresspersons with campaign finance52 by arranging fundraisers assembling pacs2936 and seeking donations from other clients many lobbyists become campaign treasurers and fundraisers for congresspersons this helps incumbent members cope with the substantial amounts of time required to raise money for reelection bids one estimate was that congresspersons had to spend a third of their working hours on fundraising activity36 pacs are fairly easy to set up it requires a lawyer and about 300 roughly12 an even steeper possible reward which can be used in exchange for favors is the lure of a highpaying job as a lobbyist according to jack abramoff one of the best ways to get what he wanted was to offer a highranking congressional aide a highpaying job after they decided to leave public office55 when such a promise of future employment was accepted according to abramoff we owned them55 this helped the lobbying firm exert influence on that particular congressperson by going through the staff member or aide at the same time it is hard for outside observers to argue that a particular decision such as hiring a former staffer into a lobbying position was purely as a reward for some past political decision since staffers often have valuable connections and policy experience needed by lobbying firms56 research economist mirko draca suggested that hiring a staffer was an ideal way for a lobbying firm to try to sway their old bosses—a congressperson—in the future56 lobbyists according to several sources strive for communications which are clear straightforward and direct52 in a oneonone meeting with a lobbyist it helps to understand precisely what goal is wanted12 a lobbyist wants action on a bill a legislator wants to be reelected53 the idea is to persuade a legislator that what the lobbyist wants is good public policy31 lobbyists often urge lawmakers to try to persuade other lawmakers to approve a bill53 senator robert byrd in 2005 still persuasion is a subtle business requiring a deft touch and carelessness can boomerang31 in one instance of a public relations reversal a lobbying initiative by the cassidy firm which targeted senator robert c byrd blew up when the cassidybyrd connection was published in the washington post this resulted in a furious byrd reversing his previous procassidy position and throwing a theatrical temper tantrum regarding an 18 million facility57 byrd denounced lobbyists who collect exorbitant fees to create projects and have them earmarked in appropriation bills for the benefit of their clients57 since it often takes a long time to build the network of relationships within the lobbying industry ethical interpersonal dealings are important a maxim in the industry is for lobbyists to be truthful with people they are trying to persuade one lobbyist described it this way what youve basically got is your word and reputation52 an untruth a lie is too risky to the successful development of a longterm relationship and the potential gain is not worth the risk52 one report suggested that belowthebelt tactics generally do not work12 one account suggest that groping for personal dirt on opponents was counterproductive since it would undermine respect for the lobbyist and their clients12 and by reverse logic if an untruth is told by an opponent or opposing lobby then it makes sense to publicize it12 but the general code among lobbyists is that unsubstantiated claims are bad business12 even worse is planting an informant in an opponents camp since if this subterfuge is ever discovered it will boomerang negatively in a hundred ways and credibility will drop to zero12 the importance of personal relationships in lobbying can be seen in the state of illinois in which fatherson ties helped push a smartgrid energy bill although there were accusations of favoritism58 and there is anecdotal evidence that a business firm seeking to profitably influence legislation has to pay particular attention to which lobbyist it hires59 strategic considerations for lobbyists trying to influence legislation include locating a power base or a constituency logically predisposed to support a given policy53 timing as well is usually important in the sense of knowing when to propose a certain action and having a bigpicture view of the possible sequence of desired actions31 strategic lobbying tries to estimate the possible responses of different groups to a possible lobby approach one study suggested that the expectations of opposition from other interests was a key factor helping to determine how a lobby should operate30 increasingly lobbyists seek to put together coalitions and use outside lobbying by swaying public opinion31 bigger more diverse and deep pocketed coalitions tend to be more effective in outside lobbying and the strength in numbers principle often applies60 interest groups try to build sustainable coalitions of similarly situated individual organizations in pursuit of likeminded goals13 according to one study it is often difficult for a lobbyist to influence a staff member in congress directly since staffers tend to be wellinformed and subject to views from competing interests as an indirect tactic lobbyists can try to manipulate public opinion which in turn can sometimes exert pressure on congresspersons52 activities for these purposes include trying to use the mass media cultivating contacts with reporters and editors encouraging them to write editorials and cover stories to influence public opinion which may have the secondary effect of influencing congress52 according to analyst ken kollman it is easier to sway public opinion than a congressional staff member since it is possible to bombard the public with halftruths distortion scare tactics and misinformation52 kollman suggests there should be two goals 1 communicate that there is public support behind an issue to policymakers and 2 increase public support for the issue among constituents31 kollman suggested outside lobbying was a powerful tool for interest group leaders31 in a sense using these criteria one could consider james madison as having engaged in outside lobbying since after the constitution was proposed he wrote many of the 85 newspaper editorials arguing for people to support the constitution and these writings later became the federalist papers10 as a result of this lobbying effort the constitution was ratified although there were narrow margins of victory in four of the state legislatures lobbying today generally requires mounting a coordinated campaign using targeted blitzes of telephone calls letters emails to congressional lawmakers marches down the washington mall bus caravans and such and these are often put together by lobbyists who coordinate a variety of interest group leaders to unite behind a hopefully simple easytograsp and persuasive message31 it is important for lobbyists to follow rules governing lobbying behavior these can be difficult and complex take time to learn require full disclosure52 and mistakes can land a lobbyist in serious legal trouble gifts for congresspersons and staffers can be problematic since anything of sizeable value must be disclosed and generally such gifts are illegal55 failure to observe gift restrictions was one factor which caused lobbyist jack abramoff to eventually plead guilty to a raft of federal corruption charges and led to convictions for 20 lobbyists and public officials including congressperson bob ney and bush deputy interior secretary stephen griles55 generally gifts to congresspersons or their staffs or federal officials are not allowed but with a few exceptions books are permitted provided that the inside cover is inscribed with the congresspersons name and the name of ones organization12 gifts under 5 are allowed12 another exception is awards so it is permitted to give a congressperson a plaque thanking him or her for support on a given issue12 cash gifts payable by check can only be made to campaign committees not to a candidate personally or to his or her staff it is not permitted to give cash or stock12 wealthy lobbyists often encourage other lobbying clients to donate to a particular cause in the hope that favors will be returned at a later date lobbyist gerald cassidy encouraged other clients to give for causes dear to a particular client engaged in a current lobbying effort57 some lobbyists give their own money cassidy reportedly donated a million dollars on one project according to one report which noted that cassidys firm received many times that much in fees from their clients paid in monthly retainers57 and their clients in turn had received hundreds of millions in earmarked appropriations and benefits worth hundreds of millions more57 the dynamics of the lobbying world make it fairly easy for a semiskilled operator to defraud a client this is essentially what happened in the jack abramoff indian lobbying scandal there was a concerned client—in this case an indian casino—worried about possible illeffects of legislation on its gambling business and there were lobbyists such as jack abramoff who knew how to exploit these fears the lobbyists actively lobbied against their own casinoclient as a way to ratchet up their fears of adverse legislation as well as stoke possible future contributions the lobbyists committed other violations such as grossly overbilling their clients as well as violating rules about giving gifts to congresspersons numerous persons went to jail after the scandal the following are factors which can make fraud a fairly easytodo activity that lobbyists are paid only to try to influence decisionmakers and may or may not succeed making it hard to tell if a lobbyist did actual work52 that much of what happens regarding interpersonal relations is obscure despite rather strict disclosure and transparency requirements that there are sizable monies involved—factors such as these almost guarantee that there will be future scandals involving fraudulent lobbying activity according to one assessment a fraud similar to abramoffs was perpetrated in maryland by lobbyist gerard e evans who was convicted of mail and wire fraud in 2000 in a case involving falsely creating a fictitious legislative threat against a client and then billing the client to work against this supposed threat61 lobbyists routinely monitor how congressional officials vote sometimes checking the past voting records of congresspersons12 one report suggested that reforms requiring publicly recorded committee votes led to more information about how congresspersons voted but instead of becoming a valuable resource for the news media or voters the information helped lobbyists monitor congressional voting patterns62 as a general rule lawmakers must vote as a particular interest group wishes them to vote or risk losing support12 strategy usually dictates targeting specific office holders on the state level one study suggested that much of the lobbying activity targeted the offices of governors as well as statelevel executive bureaucrats state lobbying was an intensely personal game with facetoface contact being required for important decisions63 lobbying can be a counteractive response to the lobbying efforts of others one study suggested this was particularly true for battles surrounding possible decisions by the supreme court which is considered as a battleground for public policy in which differing groups try to etch their policy preferences into law19 sometimes there are lobbying efforts to slow or derail other legislative processes for example when the fda began considering a cheaper generic version of the costly anticlotting drug lovenox the french pharmaceutical firm sanofi sprang into action to try and slow the process64 lobbyists are often assembled in anticipation of a potential takeover bid particularly when there are large highprofile companies or a large foreign company involved and substantial concern that the takeover may be blocked by regulatory authorities40 an example may illustrate the company tyco had learned that there had been discussion about a possible new tax provision that might have cost it 4 billion overall54 so the firm hired jack abramoff and paid him a retainer of 100000 a month54 he assembled dozens of lobbyists with connections to key congressional committees with the ultimate objective being to influence powerful senator charles grassley54 abramoff began with a fundraising effort to round up every check possible54 he sought funds from his other lobbying clients i had my clients understand that just as other clients who had nothing to do with them would step up and give contributions to congressmen they needed to have some sway with so similarly they needed to do the same i went to every client i could and rounded up every check we could for him — lobbyist jack

since government has grown increasingly complex having to deal with new technologies the task of writing rules has become more complex government has grown so complex that it is a virtual certainty that more than one agency would be affected by any piece of legislation according to one view12 lobbyists therefore spend considerable time learning the ins and outs of issues and can use their expertise to educate lawmakers65 and help them cope with difficult issues13 lobbyists knowledge has been considered to be an intellectual subsidy for lawmakers6566 some lobbyists become specialists with expertise in a particular set of issues although one study suggested that of two competing criteria for lobbyists—expertise or access—that access was far more important296768 lobby groups and their members sometimes also write legislation and whip bills and in these instances it is helpful to have lawyers skilled in writing legislation to assist with these efforts12 it is often necessary to research relevant laws and issues beforehand1 in many instances lobbyists write the actual text of the proposed law and hire lawyers to get the language down pat—an omission in wording or an unclear phrase may open up a loophole for opponents to wrangle over for years12 and lobbyists can often advise a lawmaker on how to navigate the approval process65 lobbying firms can serve as mentors and guides for example after months of protesting by the occupy wall street one lobbying firm prepared a memo to its clients warning that republicans may turn on big banks at least in public which may have the effect of altering the political ground for years to come69 here are parts of the memo which were broadcast on the msnbc network leading democratic party strategists have begun to openly discuss the benefits of embracing the growing and increasingly organized occupy wall street ows movement this would mean more than just shortterm discomfort for wall street firms if vilifying the leading companies of this sector is allowed to become an unchallenged centerpiece of a coordinated democratic campaign it has the potential to have very longlasting political policy and financial impacts on the companies in the center of the bullseye the bigger concern should be that republicans will no longer defend wall street companies — clark lytle geduldig cranford lawlobbying firm to a

contributions7374 since the 1970s there has been explosive growth in the lobbying industry particularly in washington dc by 2011 one estimate of overall lobbying spending nationally was 30 billion dollars74 an estimate of lobbying expenses in the federal arena was 35 billion in 2010 while it had been only 14 billion in 199837 and there is prodigious data since firms are required to disclose lobbying expenditures on a quarterly basis the industry however is not immune to economic downturns if congress is gridlocked such as during the summer and early fall of 2011 lobbying activity dipped considerably according to the washington post75 lobbying firm patton boggs reported drops in revenue during that year from 12 million in 2010 to 11 million in 201175 to cope with the downturn some law firms compensated by increasing activity in litigation regulatory work and representing clients in congressional investigations75 a seachange in government such as a shift in control of the legislature from one political party to the other can affect the lobbying business profoundly for example the primarily democraticserving lobbying firm cassidy associates learned that control of congress would change hands from democrats to republicans in 1994 and the firm acquired republican lobbyists before the congressional handover of power and the move helped the lobbying firm stay on top of the new political realities76 examples of lobbyingedit there are numerous examples of lobbying activity reported by the media one report chronicled a somewhat unusual alliance of consumer advocates and industry groups to boost funding for the food and drug administration the general pattern of lobbying efforts had been to try to reduce the regulatory oversight of such an agency in this case however lobbying groups wanted the federal watchdog agency to have tougher policing authority to avert expensive problems when oversight was lax in this case industry and consumer groups were in harmony and lobbyists were able to persuade officials that higher fda budgets were in the public interest77 religious consortiums according to one report have engaged in a 400 million lobbying effort on such issues as the relation between church and state civil rights for religious minorities bioethics issues including abortion and capital punishment and endoflife issues and family issues78

effectiveness of lobbyingedit there is general agreement that money is a key variable in lobbying the general consensus view is that lobbying generally works overall in achieving soughtafter results for clients particularly since it has become so prevalent with substantial and growing budgets although there are dissenting views a study by the investmentresearch firm strategas which was cited in the economist and the washington post compared the 50 firms that spent the most on lobbying relative to their assets and compared their financial performance against that of the sp 500 in the stock market the study concluded that spending on lobbying was a spectacular investment yielding blistering returns comparable to a highflying hedge fund even despite the financial downturn of the past few years59 a 2009 study by university of kansas professor raquel meyer alexander suggested that lobbying brought a substantial return on investment80 a 2011 metaanalysis of previous research findings found a positive correlation between corporate political activity and firm performance81 there are numerous reports that the national rifle association or nra successfully influenced 45 senators to block a proposed rule to regulate assault weapons despite strong public support for gun control8283 the nra spends heavily to influence gun policy it gives 3 million annually to the reelection campaigns of congresspersons directly and gives additional money to pacs and others to influence legislation indirectly according to the bbc in 201684 there is widespread agreement that a key ingredient in effective lobbying is money85 this view is shared by players in the lobbying industry deep pockets speak the money trumps it all — anonymous lobbyist 200252 still effectiveness can vary depending on the situational context one view is that large multipleissue lobbies tend to be effective in getting results for their clients if they are sophisticated managed by a legislative director familiar with the art of compromise and play political hardball12 but if such lobbies became too big such as large industrial trade organizations they became harder to control often leading to lackluster results12 a study in 2001 which compared lobbying activity in usstyle congressional against europeanstyle parliamentary systems found that in congressional systems there was an advantage favoring the agendasetters but that in both systems lobbying has a marked effect on policies86 one report suggested that the 1000 registered lobbyists in california were highly influential such that they were called the third house87 studies of lobbying by academics in previous decades painted a picture of lobbying being an ineffectual activity although many of these studies were done before lobbying became prevalent in american politics a study in 1963 by bauer pool dexter suggested lobbyists were mostly impotent in exerting influence31 studies in the early 1990s suggested that lobbying exerted influence only marginally although it suggested that when lobbying activity did achieve political impacts that the results of the political choices were sufficient to justify the expenditure on lobbying31 a fairly recent study in 2009 is that washington lobbies are far less influential than political rhetoric suggests and that most lobbying campaigns do not change any views and that there was a strong entrenchment of the status quo21 but it depends on what is seen as effective since many lobbying battles result in a stalemate since powerful interests battle and in many cases merely keeping the status quo could be seen as a victory of sorts what happens often is that varying coalitions find themselves in diametrical opposition to each other and that stalemates result1388 there is anecdotal evidence from numerous newspaper accounts of different groups battling that lobbying activity usually achieves results for example the obama administration pledged to stop forprofit colleges from luring students with false promises but with this threat the lobbying industry sprang into action with a 16 million campaign and their efforts succeeded in watering down the proposed restrictions89 how did the lobbying campaign succeed actions taken included spent 16 million89 hired allstar list of prominent players including democrats with white house ties89 plotted strategy89 worked with fundraising bundler jamie rubin a former obama communications director89 won support from influential people including congresspersonturnedlobbyist dick gephardt senatorturnedlobbyist john breaux lobbyist tony podesta washington post ceo donald e graham education entrepreneur and university of phoenix founder john sperling others89 key leaders made impassioned appeals89 mobilization effort produced 90000 public documents to the education department advocating against changes89 and sometimes merely keeping the status quo could be seen as a victory when gridlock led to the supposed supercommittee solution numerous lobbyists from all parts of the political spectrum worked hard and a stalemate resulted but with each side defended their own special interests90 and while money is an important variable it is one among many variables and there have been instances in which huge sums have been spent on lobbying only to have the result backfire one report suggested that the communications firm att failed to achieve substantial results from its lobbying efforts in 2011 since government antitrust officials rejected its plan to acquire rival tmobile91 lobbying is a practical necessity for firms that live and die by government decisions such as large government contractors such as boeing a study done in 2006 by bloomberg news suggested that lobbying was a sound moneymaking strategy for the 20 largest federal contractors the largest contractor lockheed martin corporation received almost 40 billion in federal contracts in 20034 and spent 16 million on lobbying expenses and campaign donations59 for each dollar of lobbying investment the firm received 2517 in revenues according to the report59 when the lobbying firm cassidy associates began achieving results with earmarks for colleges and universities and medical centers new lobbying firms rose to compete with them to win earmarks of their own a clear sign that the lobbying was exceedingly effective36 lobbying controversiesedit lobbying has been the subject of much debate and discussion there is general consensus that lobbying has been a significant corrupting influence in american politics although criticism is not universal and there have been arguments put forward to suggest that the system is working properly unfavorable imageedit generally the image of lobbyists and lobbying in the public sphere is not a positive one although this is not a universal sentiment lobbyists have been described as a hired gun without principles or positions52 scandals involving lobbying have helped taint the image of the profession such as ones involving lobbyist jack abramoff and congressmen randy duke cunningham and bob ney and others and which featured words such as bribery lobbyist member of congress and prison tending to appear together in the same articles1092 negative publicity can sully lobbyings image to a great extent highprofile cases of lobbying fraud such as abramoffs10 dubious fatherson exchangeoffavors ties58 public officials such as newt gingrich being accused and then denying accusations of having done lobbying and earning 16 million from strategic advice93 there are a variety of reasons why lobbying has acquired a negative image in public consciousness while there is much disclosure much of it happens in hardtodisclose personal meetings and the resulting secrecy and confidentiality can serve to lower lobbyings status12 revolving dooredit main article revolving door politics the image of a revolving door has been used to describe the relation between working in government and for lobbyists since the 1980s congresspersons and staffers have been going downtown—becoming lobbyists—and the big draw is money94 the lucrative world of k street means that former congresspersons with even modest seniority can move into jobs paying 1 million or more annually without including bonuses for bringing in new clients94 the general concern of this revolvingdoor activity is that elected officials—persons who were supposed to represent the interests of citizens—have instead become entangled with the bigmoney interests of forprofit corporations and interest groups with narrow concerns and that public officials have been taken over by private interests62 in july 2005 public citizen published a report entitled the journey from congress to k street the report analyzed hundreds of lobbyist registration documents filed in compliance with the lobbying disclosure act and the foreign agents registration act among other sources it found that since 1998 43 percent of the 198 members of congress who left government to join private life have registered to lobby a similar report from the center for responsive politics found 370 former members were in the influencepeddling business with 285 officially registered as federal lobbyists and 85 others who were described as providing strategic advice or public relations to corporate clients94 the washington post described these results as reflecting the sea change that has occurred in lawmakers attitudes toward lobbying in recent years the report included a case study of one particularly successful lobbyist bob livingston who stepped down as speakerelect and resigned his seat in 1999 in the six years since his resignation the livingston group grew into the 12th largest nonlaw lobbying firm earning nearly 40 million by the end of 2004 during roughly the same time period livingston his wife and his two political action committees pacs contributed over 500000 to the campaign funds of various candidates numerous reports chronicle the revolving door phenomenon52 a 2011 estimate suggested that nearly 5400 former congressional staffers had become federal lobbyists over a tenyear period and 400 lawmakers made a similar jump56 it is a symbiotic relationship in the sense that lobbying firms can exploit the experience and connections gleaned from working inside the legislative process and lawmakers find a ready pool of experienced talent56 there is movement in the other direction as well one report found that 605 former lobbyists had taken jobs working for lawmakers over a tenyear period56 a study by the london school of economics found 1113 lobbyists who had formerly worked in lawmakers offices56 the lobbying option is a way for staffers and lawmakers to cash in on their experience according to one view36 before the 1980s staffers and aides worked many years for congresspersons sometimes decades and tended to stay in their jobs now with the lure of higherpaying lobbying jobs many would quit their posts after a few years at most to go downtown36 lawmaker turned lobbyist democratic congressperson dick gephardt switched to lobbying and has been making millions annually working for clients such as goldman sachs and it is not just staffers but lawmakers as well including highprofile ones such as congressperson richard gephardt he represented a workingclass district in missouri for many years but after leaving congress he became a lobbyist94 in 2007 he began his own lobbying firm called gephardt government affairs group and in 2010 it was earning close to 7 million in revenues with clients including goldman sachs boeing visa inc ameren corporation and waste management inc94 senators robert bennett and byron dorgan became lobbyists too95 mississippi governor haley barbour became a lobbyist96 in 2010 former representative billy tauzin earned 11 million running the drug industrys lobbying organization called the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america94 many former representatives earned over 1 million in one year including james greenwood and daniel glickman94 insiders gameedit occupy wall street protesters have been critical of lobbying in government a similar concern voiced by critics of lobbying is that washington politics has become dominated by elites and that it is an insiders game excluding regular citizens52 and which favors entrenched firms97 individuals generally can not afford to lobby and critics question whether corporations with deeper pockets should have greater power than regular persons1 in this view the system favors the rich such that the rich have gotten richer the weak weaker admits lobbyist gerald cassidy36 there is concern that those having more money and better political connections can exert more influence than others1 however analyst barry hessenius made a case that the excessive forprofit lobbying could be counteracted if there were more efforts to increase nonprofit lobbying and boost their effectiveness1352 there is so much money that it has been described as a flood that has a corrupting influence37 so that the united states appears to be awash in interest groups10 if coalitions of different forces battle in the political arena for favorable treatment and better rules and tax breaks it can be seen as fair if both sides have equal resources and try to fight for their interests as best they can4098 gerald cassidy said in a lot of areas the stakes are between big companies and its hard to argue that one solution is better than another solution with regard to the consumers interest the issue is whether company as solution or company bs solution based on their technology or their footprint is the right one — lobbyist gerald cassidy36 a related but slightly different criticism is that the problem with lobbying as it exists today is that it creates an inequity of access to the decisionmaking process13 as a result important needs get left out of the political evaluation such that there are no antihunger lobbies or lobbies seeking serious solutions to the problem of poverty36 nonprofit advocacy has been conspicuously absent from lobbying efforts according to one view13 critics suggest that when a powerful coalition battles a less powerful one or one which is poorly connected or underfunded the result may be seen as unfair and potentially harmful for the entire society the increasing number of former lawmakers becoming lobbyists has led senator russ feingold dwi to propose paring back the many capitol hill privileges enjoyed by former senators and representatives his plan would deprive lawmakersturnedlobbyists of privileges such as unfettered access to otherwise members only areas such as the house and senate floors and the house gym choicemaking problemsedit studies have linked problems in the housing industry with lobbying efforts a concern among many critics is that influence peddling hurts overall decision making according to this criticism proposals with merit are dropped in favor of proposals backed by political expediency13 an example cited in the media is the recent battling between food industry lobbyists and healthcare lobbyists regarding school lunches a group supported by the united states department of agriculture proposed healthier lunches as a way to combat childhood obesity by limiting the number of potatoes served limiting salty foods and adding more fresh vegetables but this group was countered by a strong food lobby backed by cocacola del monte and makers of frozen pizza99 the food lobbyists succeeded in blocking the proposed reforms even writing rules suggesting that the tomato paste on a pizza qualified as a vegetable37 but overall according to critics this case appeared to be an example where business interests won out over health concerns99 critics use examples such as these to suggest that lobbying distorts sound governance99 a study by imf economists found that the heaviest lobbying came from lenders making riskier loans and expanding their mortgage business most rapidly during the housing boom and that there were indications that heavylobbying lenders were more likely to receive bailout funds97100101 the study found a correlation between lobbying by financial institutions and excessive risktaking during 2000–2007 and the authors concluded that politically active lenders played a role in accumulation of risks and thus contributed to the financial crisis101 another study suggested that governments tend to protect domestic industries and have a habit of shunting monies to ailing sectors the study suggested that it is not that government policy picks losers it is that losers pick government policy102 one critic suggested that the financial industry has successfully blocked attempts at regulation in the aftermath of the 2008 financial collapse103 governmental focusedit lobbyists collided over school lunches pizza can be served to schoolchildren since tomato paste can be considered as a vegetable and part of a healthy meal critics have contended that when lawmakers are drawn into battles to determine issues such as the composition over school lunches or how much an atm fee should be104 more serious issues such as deficit reduction or global warming or social security are neglected3762 it leads to legislative inertia105 the concern is that the preoccupation with what are seen as superficial issues prevents attention to longterm problems critics suggested that the 2011 congress spent more time discussing pertransaction debitcard fees while neglecting issues seen as more pressing62106 methodological problemsedit in this line of reasoning critics contend that lobbying in and of itself is not the sole problem but only one aspect of a larger problem with american governance critics point to an interplay of factors citizens being uninvolved politically52 congresspersons needing huge sums of money for expensive television advertising campaigns increased complexity in terms of technologies congresspersons spending three days of every week raising money106 and so forth given these temptations lobbying came along as a logical response to meet the needs of congresspersons seeking campaign funds and staffers seeking personal enrichment in a sense in competitive politics the common good gets lost i know what my client wants no one knows what the common good is — anonymous lobbyist52 a lobbyist can identify a clients needs but it is hard for a single individual to say what is best for the whole group the intent of the constitutions framers was to have builtin constitutional protections to protect the common good but according to these critics these protections do not seem to be working well the structure of representative government elected by the people was to be our systems builtin protection of the whole of us—fairly elected officeholders were to represent their constituent groups free from any obligations to special interests unfortunately money has corrupted the system and compromised both the fairness of the electoral process as well as the independence and impartiality of elected officials — barry hessenius in hardball lobbying for nonprofits 200713 former convicted lobbyist jack abramoff left listens to harvard law professor lawrence lessig in 2011 lawrence lessig a professor at harvard law school and author of republic lost suggested that the moneyed persuasive power of special interests has insinuated itself between the people and the lawmakers107108109 he quoted congressperson jim cooper who remarked that congress had become a farm league for k street in the sense that congresspersons were focused on lucrative lobbying careers after congress rather than on serving the public interest while in office110 in a speech lessig suggested the structure of incentives was such that legislators were tempted to propose unnecessary regulations as a way to further lobbying industry activity111 according to one view major legislation such as proposed wall street reforms have spurred demand for participating in the regulatory process75 lessig suggested the possibility that it was not corporations deciding to take up lobbying but congress choosing to debate lessthanimportant issues to bring wellheeled corporations into the political fray as lobbyists as a result of his concerns lessig has called on state governments to summon a second constitutional convention to propose substantive reform109 lessig believes that a constitutional amendment should be written to limit political contributions from noncitizens including corporations anonymous organizations and foreign nationals112 our current tax system with all its complexities is in part designed to make it easier for candidates in particular congressmen to raise money to get back to congress all sorts of special exceptions which expire after a limited period of time are just a reason to pick up the phone and call somebody and say your exception is about to expire here’s a good reason for you to help us fight to get it to extend and that gives them the opportunity to practice what is really a type of extortion – shaking the trees of money in the private sector into their campaign coffers so that they can run for congress again — lawrence lessig 2011105 scholars such as richard labunski sanford levinson glenn reynolds113 larry sabato114 as well as newspaper columnist william safire115 and activists such as john booth of restoringfreedomorg have called for constitutional changes that would curb the powerful role of money in politics110 expansion of lobbyingedit law in the united states is generally made by congress but as the federal government has expanded during much of the twentieth century there are a sizeable number of federal agencies generally under the control of the president these agencies write often industryspecific rules and regulations regarding such things as automobile safety and air quality114 unlike elected congresspersons who are constantly seeking campaign funds these appointed officials are harder to influence generally however there are indications that lobbyists seek to expand their influence from the halls of congress deeper into the federal bureaucracy65116 president obama pledged during the election campaign to rein in lobbying as president in january 2009 he signed two executive orders and three presidential memoranda117 to help ensure his administration would be more open transparent and accountable these documents attempted to bring increased accountability to federal spending and limit the influence of special interests and included a lobbyist gift ban and a revolving door ban in may 2009 the recovery act lobbying rules118 the executive branch reform act hr 985 was a bill which would have required over 8000 executive branch officials to report into a public database nearly any significant contact from any private party the purpose was to identify lobbying activity119 the bill was supported by proponents as an expansion of government in the sunshine including groups such as public citizen119 the national association of realtors is a special interest representing homeselling agents photo its washington headquarters but the proposals ran into serious opposition from various groups including the lobbying industry itself119 opponents argued that the proposed reporting rules would have infringed on the right to petition making it difficult not just for lobbyists but for regular citizens to communicate their views on controversial issues without having their names and viewpoints entered into a government database120 opposition groups suggested that although the proposed rules were promoted as a way to regulate lobbyists persons described as a private party could be practically anybody and that anybody contacting a federal official might be deemed to be a lobbyist the us department of justice raised constitutional and other objections to the bill121 opponents mobilized over 450 groups including the us chamber of commerce and national association of realtors with letter writing campaigns against the proposed restrictions lobbyist howard marlowe argued in a stern letter65 that the restriction on giftgiving to federal employees would create fear of retribution for political donations since your announcement to seek the presidency you have consistently attacked the honorable profession of lobbying lobbyists play an important role in the legislative process serving as educators to elected officials it is in the best interest to government to have informed individuals who serve as experts in every arena of public policy our ability to access and navigate the legislative process and push issues forward through a bureaucratic cluster is a vital service to the nation the draft order would inhibit one of the most vital tools in the advocates arsenal by creating fear of retribution for political donations making this kind of disclosure a part of the bidding process tarnishes a competition based on qualifications adds an unneeded level of bureaucracy and endangers the protection of free speech afforded to all americans by the first amendment of the constitution — howard marlowe president of the all american league of lobbyists in a letter to president obama may 31 201165116 in 2011 there were efforts to shift regulatory power from the executive branch to congress by requiring that any major rule which may cost the economy more than 100 million must be decided by congress with an upordown vote20 but skeptics think that such a move proposed by republican lawmakers could usher in a lobbying bonanza from industry and other specialinterest groups to use campaign contributions to reshape the regulatory milieu20 potential for reformedit critics suggest that congress has the power to fix itself but is reluctant to sacrifice money and power one report suggested that those in control had an unbroken record of finding ways to navigate around reform laws or turn regulatory standards to their own advantage62 arguments for lobbyingedit there are counterarguments that the system is working as it should despite being rather messy according to this line of argument the madisonian view of politics—in which factions were supposed to compete with other factions—is working exactly as it should competing factions or in this case competing interest groups square off battling happens within the federal government but instead of by settling arguments by elections arguments are settled by powerful interest groups fighting each other often financially1 and it might appear to members of groups which lost in a lobbying battle that the reason for their loss was that the other side lobbied unfairly using more money1 there are numerous instances in which opposed lobbies stalemate and instances in which these stalemates have been seen as a positive result and sometimes powerful financial interests lose the battle lobbying brings valuable information to policymakers according to another argument in favor of lobbying since lobbyists often become highly knowledgeable about a specific issue by studying it in depth over years they can bring considerable expertise to help legislators avoid errors as well as grasp the nuances of complex issues this information can also help congress oversee numerous federal agencies which often regulate complex industries and issue highly detailed and specific rulings122 accordingly it is difficult for congress to keep track of what these agencies do122 it has been argued that lobbyists can help congress monitor this activity by possibly raising red flags about proposed administrative rulings122 further congresspersons can quickly gauge where they stand about a proposed administrative ruling simply by seeing which lobbying groups support the proposal and which oppose it122 another argument in support of lobbying is that different interest groups and lobbyists while trying to build coalitions and win support often amend or soften or change their positions in this process and that interest groups and lobbyists regulate each other in a sense122 but a more general sentiment supporting the lobbying arrangement is that every citizen can be construed as being represented by dozens of special interests12 every citizen is a special interest blacks consumers teachers prochoicers gun control advocates handicapped people aliens exporters and salesmen – are all special interests there is not an american today who is not represented whether he or she knows it or not by at least a dozen special interest groups one persons special interest is another persons despotism — donald e dekieffer author of the citizens guide to lobbying congress 200712 this is what users saw when they tried to access english wikipedia on january 18 2012 english wikipedia participated in a lobbying campaign by blacking out the encyclopedia for a day and encouraged users to contact congresspersons to support positions it favored as part of an outside lobbying effort if powerful groups such as the oil industry succeed in winning a battle in government consumers who drive gaspowered cars can benefit a bit according to this view even readers of wikipedia could be conceived as being a special interest and represented by various lobbies for example opponents of the stop online piracy act believed that the act might restrict sites such as wikipedia on january 18 2012 as a form of protest and as a way to encourage readers and contributors of english wikipedia to write their congresspersons the online encyclopedia was blacked out for a day as part of an effort to lobby the government123124 another view in support of lobbying is that it serves a helpful purpose as helping guard against extremism12 according to this view lobbying adds builtin delays and permits and encourages opposing lobbies to battle12 in the battling possibly damaging decrees and incorrect decisions are stymied by seemingly unhelpful delays and waits12 a slightly different view is that lobbying is no different from other professions lobbying is no more perfect than is the practice of law or the practice of medicine — lobbyist gerald s j cassidy 200736 the regulatory environmentedit disclosure and domestic regulationsedit generally the united states requires systematic disclosure of lobbying and it may be one of the few countries to have such extensive requirements29 disclosure in one sense allows lobbyists and public officials to justify their actions under the banner of openness and with full compliance of the law125 the rules often specify how much a lobbyist can spend on specific activities and how to report expenses many of the laws and guidelines are specified in the lobbying disclosure act of 199514 transparency and disclosure requirements mean that there are volumes of statistics available for all kinds of analyses—by journalists by the public by rival lobbying efforts126 researchers can subdivide lobbying expenditures by numerous breakdowns such as by contributions from energy companies126 sometimes defining clearly who is a lobbyist and what precisely are lobbying activities can be difficult according to the lobbying disclosure act several authorized definitions include lobbying activities means lobbying contacts and efforts in support of such contacts including preparation and planning activities research and other background work that is intended at the time it is performed for use in contacts and coordination with the lobbying activities of others29 lobbying contact means any oral or written communication including an electronic communication to a covered executive branch official or a covered legislative branch official29 still distinguishing lobbyists from a strategic adviser can be difficult since the duties of each can often overlap and are hard to define precisely94 there have been issues raised about what constitutes the difference between a lobbyist and a bundler one report described bundlers as supporters who contribute their own money to his campaign and solicit it from others and there was a question whether such persons were really lobbyists involved with raising campaign monies for the election of barack obama and whether obama had broken his own pledge not to receive money from lobbyists127 the legal ramifications of lobbying are further intertangled with aspects of campaign finance reform since lobbyists often spend time seeking donations for the reelection efforts of congresspersons sorting out these issues can pose ethical challenges52 there are numerous regulations governing the practice of lobbying often ones requiring transparency and disclosure14 people paid to lobby must register with the secretary of the senate and the clerk of the house of representatives within 45 days of contacting a legislator for the first time or 45 days after being employed1214 an exception is that lobbyists who earn less than 3000 per client for each fiscal quarter or whose total lobbying expenses are less than 11500 each quarter do not need to register14 parttime lobbyists are exempt from registering unless they spend more than 20 of their working hours doing lobbying activities in any quarter if lobbyists have two or more contacts with a legislator as a lobbyist then they must register1214 requirements for registering also apply to companies that specialize in lobbying or ones that have an inhouse lobbyist particularly if they spend more than 11500 on lobbying14 generally nonprofit organizations other than churches are exempt from registering if they hire an outside lobbying firm14 filing must be made each quarter and a separate file is needed for each of the lobbyists clients and include information such as the name and title of the client an estimate of lobbying expenses and an estimate of income the lobbyist achieved after doing the lobbying14 states in addition are moving in the direction of greater disclosure and transparency regarding lobbying activities california has an online database called calaccess although there were reports that it has been underfunded128129 money collected from registration fees are often used to pay for the disclosure services such as calaccess130 there were complaints in illinois that the disclosure requirements were often not rigorous enough and allowed lobbyists to work without public notice and with possible conflicts of interest125 many local municipalities are requiring legislative agents register as lobbyists to represent the interests of clients to local city council members such as in the swing state of ohio cities such as columbus and cincinnaticitation needed laws requiring disclosure have been more prevalent in the twentieth century in 1946 there was a socalled sunshine law requiring lobbyists to disclose what they were doing on whose behalf and how much they received in payment12131 the resulting federal regulation of lobbying act of 1946 governed lobbying rules up until 1995 when the lobbying disclosure act replaced it12 the federal election campaign act of 1971 later amended in 2002 as the mccain feingold act had rules governing campaign contributions12 each branch of congress has rules as well12 legislation generally requires reports containing an accounting of major expenditures as well as legislation that was influenced the wording of some of the pertinent laws can be found in 2 usc ch 26132 the american bar association published a book about lobbying regulations lobbying law is a constantly evolving field the american bar association published a book of guidelines in 2009 with over 800 pages133 the laws are often rather specific and when not observed can lead to serious trouble57 failing to file a quarterly report or knowingly filing an incorrect report or failing to correct an incorrect report can lead to fines up to 200000 and imprisonment up to five years14 penalties can apply to lobbyists who fail to list gifts made to a legislator1457 in other situations the punishment can be light for example congressional aideturnedlobbyist fraser verrusio spent a few hours in jail after pleading guilty to taking a client to a world series baseball game and failing to report it134 tax rules can apply to lobbying in one situation the charity hawaii family forum risked losing its taxexempt status after it had engaged in lobbying activity federal tax law requires charities such as that one to limit their lobbying to 20 of their overall expenditures or else be eligible for being taxed like a forprofit corporation135 lobbyists sometimes support rules requiring greater transparency and disclosure our profession is at a critical point where we can either embrace the constructive changes and reforms by congress or we can seek out loopholes and continue the slippery slide into history along side the ranks of snake oil salesmen — lobbyist gerald s j cassidy 200736 scandals can spur impetus towards greater regulation as well the jack abramoff indian lobbying scandal which started in the 1990s and led to a guilty plea in 2006 inspired the legislative transparency and accountability act of 2006 s 2349 according to time magazine the senate bill barred lobbyists themselves from buying gifts and meals for legislators but left a loophole in which firms and organizations represented by those lobbyists could still dole out gifts and perks allowed privately funded trips if lawmakers got prior approval from a commissioned ethics committee required lobbyists to file frequent and detailed activity reports and have them posted publicly the bill was approved in 2006 by a 90–8 vote in 1995 the 104th congress tried to reform lobbying by passing the lobbying disclosure act of 1995 which defines and requires lobbyists who are compensated for their actions to register with congressional officials the legislation was later amended by the lobbying disclosure technical amendments act of 1998 there were subsequent modifications leading to the honest leadership and open government act of 200729 the lobbying transparency and accountability act of 2006 hr 4975 legislation modified senate rules although some senators and a coalition of goodgovernment groups assailed the bill as being too weak136 the honest leadership and open government act of 2007 was a comprehensive ethics and lobbying reform bill hr 2316 which passed in 2007 in the house and congress by a large majority137 a parallel senate version of the legislation s 1 passed in 2007 by a nearly unanimous vote138 after the house senate resolved their differences and passed an amended revision president bush signed the enrolled bill into law publ 110–81 some states have considered banning government employees permanently from lobbying on issues they had worked on for example there was a proposal along these lines to prevent county employees in maryland from ever lobbying on issues they had worked on the proposal insisted that county officials post financial disclosures as well as prohibit gifts from contractors27 jack abramoff emerging from prison has spoken publicly about lobbying in his view regulations designed to rein in the excesses of lobbying have not been effective and reforms and regulations have not cleaned up the system at all abramoff said lobbyists could find a way around just about any reform congress enacted and gave an example you cant take a congressman to lunch for 25 and buy him a hamburger or a steak or something like that but you can take him to a fundraising lunch and not only buy him that steak but give him 25000 extra and call it a fundraiser – and have all the same access and all the same interactions with that congressman — jack abramoff commenting on 60 minutes according to cnn55 a similar view suggested that lobbying reform efforts have been fought tooth and nail to prevent its passage since the people with the power to reform would curtail their own powers and income flows13 foreign lobbyingedit since commerce worldwide is becoming more integrated with firms headquartered in one country increasingly doing business in many other countries it is logical to expect that lobbying efforts will reflect the increasing globalization sometimes foreignowned corporations will want to lobby the united states government and in such instances new rules can apply since it can be particularly thorny resolving whether national security interests are at stake and how they might be affected in 1938 the foreign agents registration act139 required an explicit listing of all political activities undertaken by a lobbyist on behalf of any foreign principal12 there were serious concerns about lobbying firms representing foreign entities – and potentially values opposed to american principles – after axis power agitprop was planted in american soils during world war ii140 through the efforts of publicrelations specialist ivy lees proxy firm german dye trust141 as a result in 1938 the foreign agents registration act or fara was passed by congress and this law required foreign lobbyists to share information about their contracts with the justice department142 faras mandate was to disclose to policymakers the sources of information that influenced public opinions policies and law143 however the goal was not to restrict the speech of the lobbyist or the content of the lobbying144 nonetheless it was estimated that less than half of foreign lobbyists who should have registered under fara actually did so141 by the 1960s perceived failures in fara’s enforcement led to public outcry against lobbying excesses while revelations of foreign bribery circulated regularly well into the early 1970s145 this prompted legislation proposed to reduce the autonomy of foreign firms most of which was not ratified for concerns over a lack of constitutionality145 while the house of representatives passed a rule146 to increase public scrutiny of foreign lobbying one estimate was that about 75 of lobbyists were exempt from a registration requirement including individuals representing foreign interests147 a general trend is that the number of lobbyists representing foreign companies is rising148 the case of washington’s apco worldwide a firm which represented the dictatorship of general sani abacha of nigeria in 1995 whose regime had hanged nine prodemocracy activists attracted negative publicity142 while current law forbids foreign nations from contributing to federal state or local elections loopholes allow american subsidiaries of foreign corporations to establish socalled separated segregated funds or ssfs to raise money149 according to one view the definition of which firms are defined as foreign was unclear and the lack of clarity undermines the ability to regulate their activity foreignfunded lobbying efforts include those of israel saudi arabia turkey egypt pakistan libya and china lobbies in 2010 foreign governments spent approximately 460 million on lobbying congress and the us government150 between 2015–2017 the saudi arabia paid 18 million to 145 registered lobbyists to influence the us government151 while congress has tried to quell criticisms against the leverage of domestic lobbying firms by updating domestic lobbying legislation – such as the revision of the lobbyist disclosure act in 1997152—there was a report that its inaction in rectifying loopholes in foreign lobbying regulation has led to scandals152 there was a report of an upsurge of lobbying by foreignowned us subsidiaries against democratic efforts to limit campaign spending in early 2010153 the proposed was to restrict lobbying by us subsidiaries of foreign firms153 in 2011 the chinese firm alibaba hired a lobbying firm in washington when it began contemplating a purchase of the us firm yahoo40 there was a case in which a lobbying effort described as extraordinary was trying to change the designation of a fringe iranian opposition group from being a terrorist organization to being a benign organization154 lobbyists seeking to downgrade the designation hired influential foreign affairs officials including former cia directors a former fbi director and others to advocate for the change of designation154 but there have been others accused of illegally lobbying for foreign nations155 or who failed to register as a foreign agent156 who may face prison time as a result see alsoedit united states chamber of commerce history of lobbying in the united states political action committee
