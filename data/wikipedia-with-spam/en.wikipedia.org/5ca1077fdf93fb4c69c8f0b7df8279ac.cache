1944 1959 respectively119 rivalries in other sportsedit all of the intraconference rivalries in football are carried over into other sports during the 1970s ucla and notre dame had an intense mens basketball rivalry for several years it was one of a small number of nonconference games in division i basketball that was played twice a season homeandaway the most famous game in the rivalry was on january 19 1974 when notre dame scored the last 12 points of the game to nip ucla and end the bruins record 88game winning streak this rivalry is now dormant partly because notre dame is no longer independent in sports other than football now in the acc in baseball there are intense rivalries between the four southern schools arizona arizona state and usc have long and successful histories in baseball and all have won national titles in the sport the most intense series is widely regarded to be the basebrawl series between usc and arizona state in 1990 arizona state swept the series and in the final game a bench clearing brawl spread quickly to the stands and made national headlines several were injured and riot police were called to end the fracas washington and california have a longstanding rivalry in mens crew as the two traditionally dominant programs on the west coast due to the unique geographic nature of the pac12 teams the teams travel in pairs for road basketball games for example on thursday february 28 2008 usc played arizona and ucla played arizona state two nights later the teams switched and usc played arizona state and ucla played arizona the teams are paired as follows usc and ucla the la teams arizona and arizona state the arizona teams california and stanford the bay area teams washington and washington state the washington teams oregon and oregon state the oregon teams and colorado and utah the rocky mountain teams usually the games are played on thursdays and saturdays with a game or occasionally two on sundays for television purposes this pairing formula is also used in womens volleyball to make scheduling simpler for men and womens basketball a sport in which each conference member uses a single venue for both teams home games the schedule for womens basketball is the opposite of the mens schedule for example when the oregon schools are hosting the mens teams from the arizona schools the arizona schools host the womens teams from oregon schools the same weekend this formula has made a tradition in conference play to keep track of how a team does against a particular region and stats are kept at to how successful a team is against for example the bay area schools at home or away effective in the 201112 season with the expansion into 12 teams a 10year rotation model has been developed to maintain the existing 18game conference schedule teams remained paired with their regional rival each school plays its regional rival and six other teams both home and away and the other four teams once – two at home and two away the newest members colorado and utah are paired with each other the single play opponents rotate every two years120 recently cal poly and ucla has grown into a competitive mens soccer rivalry with cal poly hosting ucla in a 00 tie in front of a crowd of 8717 which at the time was the 9th largest regular season oncampus attendance in the history of college soccer121 the schools have played
