three times in the 1950s coming in at number 10 in 1954 number 6 in 1955 and number 4 in 1958 the 1960s proved to be a fallow decade for brando he directed and starred in the cult western film oneeyed

did not appear in a successful film he won his second academy award for playing vito corleone in francis ford coppolas the godfather a role critics consider among his greatest the godfather was then

sixth and tenth in the money making stars poll in 1972 and 1973 respectively brando took a fouryear hiatus before appearing in the missouri breaks 1976 after this he was content with being a highly

19221994 his ancestry included german dutch english and irish121314 his patrilineal immigrant ancestor johann wilhelm brandau arrived in new york in the early 1700s from the palatinate in germany15 brando was raised a christian scientist16 his mother known as dodie was unconventional for her time she smoked wore trousers and drove cars an actress herself and even a theatre administrator she helped henry fonda begin his acting career however she was an alcoholic and often had to be brought home from chicago bars by her husband in his autobiography songs my mother taught me brando expressed sadness when writing about his mother the anguish that her drinking produced was that she preferred getting drunk to caring for us17 dodie and brandos father eventually joined alcoholics anonymous18 brando harbored far more enmity for his father stating i was his namesake but nothing i did ever pleased or even interested him he enjoyed telling me i couldnt do anything right he had a habit of telling me i would never amount to anything19 brandos parents moved to evanston illinois when his fathers work took him to chicago but separated when brando was 11 years old his mother took the three children to santa ana california where they lived with her mother in 1937 brandos parents reconciled and moved together to libertyville illinois a small town north of chicago20 in 1939 and 1941 he worked as an usher at the towns only movie theatre the liberty21 brando whose childhood nickname was bud was a mimic from his youth he developed an ability to absorb the mannerisms of kids he played with and display them dramatically while staying in character he was introduced to neighborhood boy wally cox and the two were unlikely closest friends until coxs death in 1973 in the 2007 tcm biopic brando the documentary childhood friend george englund recalls brandos earliest acting as imitating the cows and horses on the family farm as a way to distract his mother from drinking his sister jocelyn was the first to pursue an acting career going to study at the american academy of dramatic arts in new york city she appeared on broadway then films and television brandos sister frances left college in california to study art in new york brando had been held back a year in school and was later expelled from libertyville high school for riding his motorcycle through the corridors22 he was sent to shattuck military academy where his father had studied before him brando excelled at theatre and did well in the school in his final year 1943 he was put on probation for being insubordinate to a visiting army colonel during maneuvers he was confined to his room but sneaked into town and was caught the faculty voted to expel him though he was supported by the students who thought expulsion was too harsh he was invited back for the following year but decided instead to drop out of high school brando worked as a ditchdigger as a summer job arranged by his father he tried to enlist in the army but his induction physical revealed that a football injury he had sustained at shattuck had left him with a trick knee he was classified 4f and not inducted12 new york and actingedit brando decided to follow his sisters to new york studying at the american theatre wing professional school part of the dramatic workshop of the new school with influential german director erwin piscator in a 1988 documentary marlon brando the wild one brandos sister jocelyn remembered he was in a school play and enjoyed it  so he decided he would go to new york and study acting because that was the only thing he had enjoyed that was when he was 18 in the ae biography episode on brando george englund said brando fell into acting in new york because he was accepted there he wasnt criticized it was the first time in his life that he heard good things about himself23 brando was an avid student and proponent of stella adler from whom he learned the techniques of the stanislavski system this technique encouraged the actor to explore both internal and external aspects to fully realize the character being portrayed brandos remarkable insight and sense of realism were evident early on adler used to recount that when teaching brando she had instructed the class to act like chickens and added that a nuclear bomb was about to fall on them most of the class clucked and ran around wildly but brando sat calmly and pretended to lay an egg asked by adler why he had chosen to react this way he said im a chicken—what do i know about bombs24 despite being commonly regarded as a method actor brando disagreed he claimed to have abhorred lee strasbergs teachings after i had some success lee strasberg tried to take credit for teaching me how to act he never taught me anything he would have claimed credit for the sun and the moon if he believed he could get away with it he was an ambitious selfish man who exploited the people who attended the actors studio and tried to project himself as an acting oracle and guru some people worshipped him but i never knew why i sometimes went to the actors studio on saturday mornings because elia kazan was teaching and there were usually a lot of goodlooking girls but strasberg never taught me acting stella adler did—and later kazan25 marlon brando was the first to bring a natural approach to acting on film according to dustin hoffman in his online masterclass brando would often talk to camera men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action once brando felt he could deliver the dialogue as natural as that conversation he would start the dialogue in his 2015 documentary listen to me marlon he said before that actors were like breakfast cereals he was calling them predictable critics would later say this was brando being difficult but actors who worked opposite would say it was just all part of his technique2627 careeredit early career 19441951edit a 24yearold marlon brando on the set of the broadway production of a streetcar named desire 1948 brando used his stanislavski system skills for his first summer stock roles in sayville new york on long island brando established a pattern of erratic insubordinate behavior in the few shows he had been in his behavior had him kicked out of the cast of the new schools production in sayville but he was soon afterwards discovered in a locally produced play there then in 1944 he made it to broadway in the bittersweet drama i remember mama playing the son of mady christians the lunts wanted brando to play the role of alfred lunts son in o mistress mine and lunt even coached him for his audition but brandos reading during the audition was so desultory that they couldnt hire him new york drama critics voted him most promising young actor for his role as an anguished veteran in truckline café although the play was a commercial failure in 1946 he appeared on broadway as the young hero in the political drama a flag is born refusing to accept wages above the actors equity rate2829 in that same year brando played the role of marchbanks alongside katharine cornell in her productions revival of candida one of her signature roles30 cornell also cast him as the messenger in her production of jean anouilhs antigone that same year he was also offered the opportunity to portray one of the principal characters in the broadway premiere of eugene oneills the iceman cometh but turned the part down after falling asleep while trying to read the massive script and pronouncing the play ineptly written and poorly constructed31 in 1945 brandos agent recommended he take a costarring role in the eagle has two heads with tallulah bankhead produced by jack wilson bankhead had turned down the role of blanche dubois in a streetcar named desire which williams had written for her to tour the play for the 19461947 season bankhead recognized brandos potential despite her disdain which most broadway veterans shared for method acting and agreed to hire him even though he auditioned poorly the two clashed greatly during the prebroadway tour with bankhead reminding brando of his mother being her age and also having a drinking problem wilson was largely tolerant of brandos behavior but he reached his limit when brando mumbled through a dress rehearsal shortly before the november 28 1946 opening i dont care what your grandmother did wilson exclaimed and that method stuff i want to know what youre going to do brando in turn raised his voice and acted with great power and passion it was marvelous a cast member recalled everybody hugged him and kissed him he came ambling offstage and said to me they dont think you can act unless you can yell critics were not as kind however a review of brandos performance in the opening assessed that brando was still building his character but at present fails to impress one boston critic remarked of brandos prolonged death scene brando looked like a car in midtown manhattan searching for a parking space he received better reviews at subsequent tour stops but what his colleagues recalled was only occasional indications of the talent he would later demonstrate there were a few times when he was really magnificent bankhead admitted to an interviewer in 1962 he was a great young actor when he wanted to be but most of the time i couldnt even hear him on the stage brando displayed his apathy for the production by demonstrating some shocking onstage manners he tried everything in the world to ruin it for her bankheads stage manager claimed he nearly drove her crazy scratching his crotch picking his nose doing anything after several weeks on the road they reached boston by which time bankhead was ready to dismiss him this proved to be one of the greatest blessings of his career as it freed him up to play the role of stanley kowalski in tennessee williamss 1947 play a streetcar named desire directed by elia kazan bankhead had recommended him to williams for the role of stanley thinking he was perfect for the part pierpont writes that john garfield was first choice for the role but made impossible demands it was kazans decision to fall back on the far less experienced and technically too young for the role brando in a letter dated august 29 1947 williams confided to his agent audrey wood it had not occurred to me before what an excellent value would come through casting a very young actor in this part it humanizes the character of stanley in that it becomes the brutality and callousness of youth rather than a vicious old man  a new value came out of brandos reading which was by far the best reading i have ever heard brando based his portrayal of kowalski on the boxer rocky graziano whom he had studied at a local gymnasium graziano did not know who brando was but attended the production with tickets provided by the young man he said the curtain went up and on the stage is that son of a bitch from the gym and hes playing me32page needed in 1947 brando performed a screen test for an early warner brothers script for the novel rebel without a cause 1944 which bore no relation to the film eventually produced in 195533 the screen test is included as an extra in the 2006 dvd release of a streetcar named desire brandos first screen role was a bitter paraplegic veteran in the men 1950 he spent a month in bed at the birmingham army hospital in van nuys to prepare for the role the new york times reviewer bosley crowther wrote that brando as ken is so vividly real dynamic and sensitive that his illusion is complete and noted out of stiff and frozen silences he can lash into a passionate rage with the tearful and flailing frenzy of a taut cable suddenly cut by brandos own account it may have been because of this film that his draft status was changed from 4f to 1a he had had surgery on his trick knee and it was no longer physically debilitating enough to incur exclusion from the draft when brando reported to the induction center he answered a questionnaire by saying his race was human his color was seasonaloyster white to beige and he told an army doctor that he was psychoneurotic when the draft board referred him to a psychiatrist brando explained that he had been expelled from military school and had severe problems with authority coincidentally the psychiatrist knew a doctor friend of brando brando avoided military service during the korean war12 early in his career brando began using cue cards instead of memorizing his lines despite the objections of several of the film directors he worked with brando felt that this helped bring realism and spontaneity to his performances he felt otherwise he would appear to be reciting a writers speech3435 in the tv documentary the making of superman the movie brando explained if you dont know what the words are but you have a general idea of what they are then you look at the cue card and it gives you the feeling to the viewer hopefully that the person is really searching for what he is going to say—that he doesnt know what to say however some thought brando used the cards out of laziness or an inability to memorize his lines once on the godfather set brando was asked why he wanted his lines printed out he responded because i can read them that way36 rise to fame 19511954edit brando brought his performance as stanley kowalski to the screen in tennessee williams a streetcar named desire 1951 the role is regarded as one of brandos greatest the reception of brandos performance was so positive that brando quickly became a male sex symbol in hollywood the role earned him his first academy award nomination in the best actor category brando as emiliano zapata in a trailer for the 1952 film viva zapata he was also nominated the next year for viva zapata 1952 a fictionalized account of the life of mexican revolutionary emiliano zapata it recounted his peasant upbringing his rise to power in the early 20th century and death the film was directed by elia kazan and costarred anthony quinn in the biopic marlon brando the wild one sam shaw says secretly before the picture started he went to mexico to the very town where zapata lived and was born in and it was there that he studied the speech patterns of people their behavior movementcitation needed most critics focused on the actor rather than the film with time and newsweek publishing rave reviews years later in his autobiography brando remarked tony quinn whom i admired professionally and liked personally played my brother but he was extremely cold to me while we shot that picture during our scenes together i sensed a bitterness toward me and if i suggested a drink after work he either turned me down or else was sullen and said little only years later did i learn why brando related that to create onscreen tension between the two gadg kazan had told quinn—who had taken over the role of stanley kowalski on broadway after brando had finished—that brando had been unimpressed with his work after achieving the desired effect kazan never told quinn that he had misled him it was only many years later after comparing notes that brando and quinn realized the deception brandos next film julius caesar 1953 received highly favorable reviews brando portrayed mark antony while most acknowledged brandos talent some critics felt brandos mumbling and other idiosyncrasies betrayed a lack of acting fundamentals and when his casting was announced many remained dubious about his prospects for success directed by joseph l mankiewicz and costarring british stage actor john gielgud brando delivered an impressive performance especially during antonys noted friends romans countrymen  speech gielgud was so impressed that he offered brando a full season at the hammersmith theatre an offer he declined in his biography on the actor stefan kanfer writes marlons autobiography devotes one line to his work on that film among all those british professionals for me to walk onto a movie set and play mark anthony was asinine—yet another example of his persistent selfdenigration and wholly incorrect37 kanfer adds that after a screening of the film director john huston commented christ it was like a furnace door opening—the heat came off the screen i dont know another actor who could do thatcitation needed during the filming of julius caesar brando learned that elia kazan had cooperated with congressional investigators naming a whole string of subversives to the house committee on unamerican activities by all accounts brando was upset by his mentors decision but he worked with him again in on the waterfront none of us is perfect he later wrote in his memoir and i think that gadg has done injury to others but mostly to himselfcitation needed in 1953 brando also starred in the wild one riding his own triumph thunderbird 6t motorcycle triumphs importers were ambivalent at the exposure as the subject matter was rowdy motorcycle gangs taking over a small town the film was criticized for its perceived gratuitous violence at the time with time stating the effect of the movie is not to throw light on the public problem but to shoot adrenaline through the moviegoers veinscitation needed brando allegedly did not see eye to eye with the hungarian director lászló benedek and did not get on with costar lee marvin to brandos expressed puzzlement the movie inspired teen rebellion and made him a role model to the nascent rockandroll generation and future stars such as james dean and elvis presley after the movies release the sales of leather jackets and blue jeans skyrocketedcitation needed reflecting on the movie in his autobiography brando concluded that it had not aged very well but said more than most parts ive played in the movies or onstage i related to johnny and because of this i believe i played him as more sensitive and sympathetic than the script envisioned theres a line in the picture where he snarls nobody tells me what to do thats exactly how ive felt all my life38 later that same year brando starred in lee falks production of george bernard shaws arms and the man in boston falk was proud to tell people that brando turned down an offer of 10000 per week on broadway in favor of working in his production in boston for less than 500 per weekcitation needed it was the last time brando acted in a stage playcitation needed on the waterfrontedit in 1954 brando starred in on the waterfront a crime drama film about union violence and corruption among longshoremen the film was directed by elia kazan and written by budd schulberg it also stars karl malden lee j cobb rod steiger and in her film debut eva marie saint when initially offered the role brando—still stung by kazans testimony to huac—demurred and the part of terry malloy nearly went to frank sinatra according to biographer stefan kanfer the director believed that sinatra who grew up in hoboken would work as malloy but eventually producer sam spiegel wooed brando to the part signing him for 100000 kazan made no protest because he subsequently confessed i always preferred brando to anybody39 brando with eva marie saint in the trailer for on the waterfront 1954 brando won the oscar for his role as terry malloy in on the waterfront his performance spurred on by his rapport with eva marie saint and kazans direction was praised as a tour de force for the famous i coulda been a contender scene he convinced kazan that the scripted scene was unrealistic schulbergs script had brando acting the entire scene with his character being held at gunpoint by his brother charlie played by rod steiger brando insisted on gently pushing away the gun saying that terry would never believe that his brother would pull the trigger and doubting that he could continue his speech while fearing a gun on him kazan let brando improvise and later expressed deep admiration for brandos instinctive understanding saying what was extraordinary about his performance i feel is the contrast of the toughguy front and the extreme delicacy and gentle cast of his behavior what other actor when his brother draws a pistol to force him to do something shameful would put his hand on the gun and push it away with the gentleness of a caress who else could read oh charlie in a tone of reproach that is so loving and so melancholy and suggests the terrific depth of pain  if there is a better performance by a man in the history of film in america i dont know what it is40 upon its release on the waterfront received glowing reviews from critics and was a commercial success earning an estimated 42 million in rentals at the north american box office in 195441 in his july 29 1954 review the new york times critic a h weiler praised the film calling it an uncommonly powerful exciting and imaginative use of the screen by gifted professionals42 film critic roger ebert lauded the film stating that brando and kazan changed acting in american films forever and added it to his great movies list43 in his autobiography brando was typically dismissive of his performance on the day gadg showed me the complete picture i was so depressed by my performance i got up and left the screening room  i thought i was a huge failurecitation needed after brando won the academy award for best actor the statue was stolen much later it turned up at a london auction house which contacted the actor and informed him of its whereaboutscitation needed brando would later say in his 2015 documentary listen to me marlon that he felt the part in on the waterfront that won him an oscar was to him personally not good and that he knew he had done better acting in the behind the scenes of on the waterfront film experts and critics would say he would change lines because he didnt like the script and that hed let the director know by having regular conversations however this was a way for brando to prepare before a scene by warming up before starting the dialogue in order to deliver it as natural as possible brando often saw a shrink and reportedly wasnt there for some of the shooting of the scene when the close up was on the opposite actor this is why this part of his technique is recognized mistakenly as him being difficult and not a part of his approach44 box office successes and directorial debut 19541959edit following on the waterfront brando remained a top box office draw but critics increasingly felt his performances were halfhearted lacking the intensity and commitment found in his earlier work especially in his work with kazan he portrayed napoleon in the 1954 film désirée according to costar jean simmons brandos contract forced him to star in the movie he put little effort into the role claiming he didnt like the script and later dismissed the entire movie as superficial and dismal brando was especially contemptuous of director henry koster brando and simmons were paired together again in the film adaptation of the musical guys and dolls 1955 guys and dolls would be brandos first and last musical role time found the picture false to the original in its feeling remarking that brando sings in a faraway tenor that sometimes tends to be flat appearing in edward murrows person to person interview in early 1955 he admitted to having problems with his singing voice which he called pretty terrible in the 1965 documentary meet marlon brando he revealed that the final product heard in the movie was a result of countless singing takes being cut into one and later joked i couldnt hit a note with a baseball bat some notes i missed by extraordinary margins  they sewed my words together on one song so tightly that when i mouthed it in front of the camera i nearly asphyxiated myself relations between brando and costar frank sinatra were also frosty with stefan kanfer observing the two men were diametrical opposites marlon required multiple takes frank detested repeating himself upon their first meeting sinatra reportedly scoffed dont give me any of that actors studio shit brando later famously quipped frank is the kind of guy when he dies hes going to heaven and give god a hard time for making him bald frank sinatra famously called brando the worlds most overrated actor and referred to him as mumbles45citation needed the film was commercially though not critically successful costing 55 million to make and grossing 13 millioncitation needed brando played sakini a japanese interpreter for the us army in postwar japan in the teahouse of the august moon 1956 pauline kael was not particularly impressed by the movie but noted marlon brando starved himself to play the pixie interpreter sakini and he looks as if hes enjoying the stunt—talking with a mad accent grinning boyishly bending forward and doing tricky movements with his legs hes harmlessly genial and he is certainly missed when hes offscreen though the fey roguish role doesnt allow him to do what hes great at and its possible that hes less effective in it than a lesser actor might have been in sayonara 1957 he appeared as a united states air force officer newsweek found the film a dull tale of the meeting of the twain but it was nevertheless a box office success according to stefan kanfers biography of the actor brandos manager jay kanter negotiated a profitable contract with ten percent of the gross going to brando which put him in the millionaire category the movie was controversial due to openly discussing interracial marriage but proved a great success earning 10 academy award nominations with brando being nominated for best actor the film went on to win four academy awards teahouse and sayonara were the first in a string of films brando would strive to make over the next decade which contained socially relevant messages and he formed a partnership with paramount to establish his own production company called pennebaker its declared purpose to develop films that contained social value that would improve the world the name was a tribute in honor of his mother who had died in 1954 by all accounts brando was devastated by her death with biographer peter manso telling aes biography she was the one who could give him approval like no one else could and after his mother died it seems that marlon stops caring brando appointed his father to run pennebaker in the same ae special george englund claims that brando gave his father the job because it gave marlon a chance to take shots at him to demean and diminish him in 1958 brando appeared in the young lions dyeing his hair blonde and assuming a german accent for the role which he later admitted was not convincing the film is based on the novel by irwin shaw and brandos portrayal of the character christian diestl was controversial for its time he later wrote the original script closely followed the book in which shaw painted all germans as evil caricatures especially christian whom he portrayed as a symbol of everything that was bad about nazism he was mean nasty vicious a cliché of evil  i thought the story should demonstrate that there are no inherently bad people in the world but they can easily be misled shaw and brando even appeared together for a televised interview with cbs correspondent david schoenbrun and during a bombastic exchange shaw charged that like most actors brando was incapable of playing flatout villainy brando responded by stating nobody creates a character but an actor i play the role now he exists he is my creation the young lions also features brandos only appearance in a film with friend and rival montgomery clift although they shared no scenes together brando closed out the decade by appearing in the fugitive kind 1960 opposite anna magnani the film was based on another play by tennessee williams but was hardly the success a streetcar named desire had been with the los angeles times labeling williamss personae psychologically sick or just plain ugly and the new yorker calling it a cornpone melodrama oneeyed jacks and mutiny on the bountyedit in 1961 brando made his directorial debut in the western oneeyed jacks the picture was originally directed by stanley kubrick but he was fired early in the production paramount then made brando the director brando portrays the lead character rio and karl malden plays his partner dad longworth the supporting cast features katy jurado ben johnson and slim pickens brandos penchant for multiple retakes and character exploration as an actor carried over into his directing however and the film soon went over budget paramount expected the film to take three months to complete but shooting stretched to six and the cost doubled to more than six million dollars brandos inexperience as an editor also delayed postproduction and paramount eventually took control of the film brando later wrote paramount said it didnt like my version of the story id had everyone lie except karl malden the studio cut the movie to pieces and made him a liar too by then i was bored with the whole project and walked away from itcitation needed oneeyed jacks was poorly reviewed by critics while the film did solid business it ran so over budget that it lost money brandos revulsion with the film industry reportedly boiled over on the set of his next film metrogoldwynmayers remake of mutiny on the bounty which was filmed in tahiti the actor was accused of deliberately sabotaging nearly every aspect of the production on june 16 1962 the saturday evening post ran an article by bill davidson with the headline six million dollars down the drain the mutiny of marlon brando mutiny director lewis milestone claimed that the executives deserve what they get when they give a ham actor a petulant child complete control over an expensive picture mutiny on the bounty nearly capsized mgm and while the project had indeed been hampered with delays other than brandos behavior the accusations would dog the actor for years as studios began to fear brandos difficult reputation critics also began taking note of his fluctuating weight box office decline 19631971edit distracted by his personal life and becoming disillusioned with his career brando began to view acting as a means to a financial end critics protested when he started accepting roles in films many perceived as being beneath his talent or criticized him for failing to live up to the better roles previously only signing short term deals with movie studios in 1961 brando uncharacteristically signed a fivepicture deal with universal studios that would haunt him for the rest of the decade the ugly american 1963 was the first of these films based on the 1958 novel of the same name that pennebaker had optioned the movie which featured brandos sister jocelyn was rated fairly positively but died at the box office brando was nominated for a golden globe for his performance all of brandos other universal films during this period including bedtime story 1964 the appaloosa 1966 a countess from hong kong 1967 and the night of the following day 1969 were also critical and commercial flops46 countess in particular was a disappointment for brando who had looked forward to working with one of his heroes director charlie chaplin the experience turned out to be an unhappy one brando was horrified at chaplins didactic style of direction and his authoritarian approach brando had also appeared in the spy thriller morituri in 1965 that too failed to attract an audience brando acknowledged his professional decline writing later some of the films i made during the sixties were successful some werent some like the night of the following day i made only for the money others like candy i did because a friend asked me to and i didnt want to turn him down  in some ways i think of my middle age as the fuck you years candy was especially appalling for many a 1968 sex farce film directed by christian marquand and based on the 1958 novel by terry southern the movie satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine candy played by ewa aulin it is generally regarded as the nadir of brandos career the washington post observed brandos selfindulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents in the march 1966 issue of the atlantic pauline kael wrote that in his rebellious days brando was antisocial because he knew society was crap he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap but now brando and others like him had become buffoons shamelessly pathetically mocking their public reputations in an earlier review of the appaloosa in 1966 kael wrote that the actor was trapped in another dog of a movie  not for the first time mr brando gives us a heavylidded adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate stalwart loner although he feigned indifference brando was hurt by the critical mauling admitting in the 2015 film listen to me marlon they can hit you every day and you have no way of fighting back i was very convincing in my pose of indifference but i was very sensitive and it hurt a lotthis quote needs a citation while brando had lost much of his critical and commercial appeal in the 1960s he still gave some memorable performances brando portrayed a repressed gay army officer in reflections in a golden eye directed by john huston and costarring elizabeth taylor the role turned out as one of his most acclaimed in years with stanley crouch marveling brandos main achievement was to portray the taciturn but stoic gloom of those pulverized by circumstances47 the film overall received mixed reviews another notable film was the chase 1966 which paired the actor with arthur penn robert duvall jane fonda and robert redford the film deals with themes of racism sexual revolution smalltown corruption and vigilantism the film was received mostly positively brando cited burn 1969 as his personal favorite of the films he had made writing in his autobiography i think i did some of the best acting ive ever done in that picture but few people came to see it brando dedicated a full chapter to the film in his memoir stating that the director gillo pontecorvo was the best director he had ever worked with next to kazan and bernardo bertolucci brando also detailed his clashes with pontecorvo on the set and how we nearly killed each other loosely based on events in the history of guadeloupe the film got a hostile reception from critics in 1971 michael winner directed him in the british horror film the nightcomers with stephanie beacham thora hird harry andrews and anna palk it is a prequel to the turn of the screw which later became the 1961 film the innocents brandos performance earned him a nomination for a best actor bafta but the film bombed at the box office the godfather and last tango in parisedit during the 1970s brando was considered unbankable48 critics were becoming increasingly dismissive of his work and he had not appeared in a box office hit since the young lions in 1958 the last year he had ranked as one of the top ten box office stars49 and the year of his last academy award nomination for sayonara brandos performance as vito corleone the don in the godfather 1972 francis ford coppolas adaptation of mario puzos 1969 bestselling novel of the same name was a career turning point putting him back in the top ten and winning him his second best actor oscar paramount production chief robert evans who had given puzo an advance to write the godfather so that paramount would own the movie rights50 hired coppola after many major directors had turned the movie down because he wanted an italianamerican director who could provide the movie with cultural authenticity coppola also came cheap evans was conscious of the fact that paramounts last mafia movie the brotherhood 1968 had been a box office bomb and he believed it was partly due to the fact that the director martin ritt and the star kirk douglas were jews and the film lacked an authentic italian flavor51 the studio originally intended the movie to be a lowbudget production set in contemporary times without any major actors but the phenomenal success of the novel gave evans the clout to turn the godfather into a prestige picture coppola had developed a list of actors for all the roles and his list of potential dons included the oscarwinning italianamerican ernest borgnine52 the italianamerican frank de kova best known for playing chief wild eagle on the tv sitcom ftroop john marley a best supporting oscarnominee for paramounts 1970 hit movie love story who was cast as the movie producer jack woltz in the picture the italianamerican richard conte who was cast as don corleones deadly rival don emilio barzini and italian movie producer carlo ponti coppola admitted in a 1975 interview we finally figured we had to lure the best actor in the world it was that simple that boiled down to laurence olivier or marlon brando who are the greatest actors in the world the holographic copy of coppolas cast list shows brandos name underlined53 evans told coppola that he had been thinking of brando for the part two years earlier and puzo had imagined brando in the part when he wrote the novel and had actually written to him about the part54 so coppola and evans narrowed it down to brando55 ironically olivier would compete with brando for the best actor oscar for his part in sleuth he bested brando at the 1972 new york film critics circle awards albert s ruddy whom paramount assigned to produce the film agreed with the choice of brando however paramount studio heads were opposed to casting brando due to his reputation for difficulty and his long string of box office flops brando also had oneeyed jacks working against him a troubled production that lost money for paramount when it was released in 1961 paramount pictures president stanley jaffe told an exasperated coppola as long as im president of this studio marlon brando will not be in this picture and i will no longer allow you to discuss it56 jaffe eventually set three conditions for the casting of brando that he would have to take a fee far below what he typically received hed have to agree to accept financial responsibility for any production delays his behavior cost and he had to submit to a screen test coppola convinced brando to a videotaped makeup test in which brando did his own makeup he used cotton balls to simulate the characters puffed cheeks coppola had feared brando might be too young to play the don but was electrified by the actors characterization as the head of a crime family even so he had to fight the studio in order to cast the temperamental actor brando had doubts himself stating in his autobiography i had never played an italian before and i didnt think i could do it successfully eventually charles bluhdorn the president of paramount parent gulfwestern was won over to letting brando have the role when he saw the screen test he asked in amazement what are we watching who is this old guinea brando was signed for a low fee of 50000 but in his contract he was given a percentage of the gross on a sliding scale 1 of the gross for each 10 million over a 10 million threshold up to 5 if the picture exceeded 60 million according to evans brando sold back his points in the picture for 100000 as he was in dire need of funds that 100000 cost him 11 million evans claimed57 in a 1994 interview that can be found on the academy of achievement website coppola insisted the godfather was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it they were very unhappy with it they didnt like the cast they didnt like the way i was shooting it i was always on the verge of getting fired when word of this reached brando he threatened to walk off the picture writing in his memoir i strongly believe that directors are entitled to independence and freedom to realize their vision though francis left the characterizations in our hands and we had to figure out what to do in a 2010 television interview with larry king al pacino also talked about how brandos support helped him keep the role of michael corleone in the movie—despite the fact coppola wanted to fire him brando was on his best behavior during filming buoyed by a cast that included pacino robert duvall james caan and diane keaton in the vanity fair article the godfather wars mark seals writes with the actors as in the movie brando served as the head of the family he broke the ice by toasting the group with a glass of wine when we were young brando was like the godfather of actors says robert duvall i used to meet with dustin hoffman in cromwells drugstore and if we mentioned his name once we mentioned it 25 times in a day caan adds the first day we met brando everybody was in awe brandos performance was glowingly reviewed by critics i thought it would be interesting to play a gangster maybe for the first time in the movies who wasnt like those bad guys edward g robinson played but who is kind of a hero a man to be respected brando recalled in his autobiography also because he had so much power and unquestioned authority i thought it would be an interesting contrast to play him as a gentle man unlike al capone who beat up people with baseball bats duvall later marveled to aes biography he minimized the sense of beginning in other words he like deemphasized the word action he would go in front of that camera just like he was before cut it was all the same there was really no beginning i learned a lot from watching that brando won the academy award for best actor for his performance but he declined it becoming the second actor to refuse a best actor award after george c scott for patton he boycotted the award ceremony instead sending american indian rights activist sacheen littlefeather who appeared in full apache attire to state brandos reasons which were based on his objection to the depiction of american indians by hollywood and television58 the actor followed the godfather with bernardo bertoluccis 1972 film last tango in paris opposite maria schneider but brandos highly noted performance threatened to be overshadowed by an uproar over the sexual content of the film brando portrays a recent american widower named paul who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young betrothed parisian woman named jeanne as with previous films brando refused to memorize his lines for many scenes instead he wrote his lines on cue cards and posted them around the set for easy reference leaving bertolucci with the problem of keeping them out of the picture frame the film features several intense graphic scenes involving brando including paul anally raping jeanne using butter as a lubricant and pauls angry emotionally charged final confrontation with the corpse of his dead wife the controversial movie was a hit however and brando made the list of top ten box office stars for the last time the voting membership of the academy of motion picture arts sciences again nominated brando for best actor his seventh nomination although brando won the 1973 new york film critics circle awards the actor did not appear at the ceremony or send a representative to pick up the award if he won critic pauline kael in her famous new yorker review wrote the movie breakthrough has finally come bertolucci and brando have altered the face of an art form brando confessed in his autobiography to this day i cant say what last tango in paris was about and added the film required me to do a lot of emotional arm wrestling with myself and when it was finished i decided that i wasnt ever again going to destroy myself emotionally to make a movie i felt i had violated my innermost self and i didnt want to suffer like that anymore  you cant fake itthis quote needs a citation in 1973 brando was devastated by the death of his childhood best friend wally cox brando slept in coxs pajamas and wrenched his ashes from his widow she was going to sue for their return but finally said i think marlon needs the ashes more than i do59 late 1970sedit in 1976 brando appeared in the missouri breaks with his friend jack nicholson the movie also reunited the actor with director arthur penn as biographer stefan kanfer describes penn had difficulty controlling brando who seemed intent on going over the top with his borderruffianturnedcontractkiller robert e lee clayton marlon made him a crossdressing psychopath absent for the first hour of the movie clayton enters on horseback dangling upside down caparisoned in white buckskin littlefeatherstyle he speaks in an irish accent for no apparent reason over the next hour also for no apparent reason clayton assumes the intonation of a british upperclass twit and an elderly frontier woman complete with a granny dress and matching bonnet penn who believed in letting actors do their thing indulged marlon all the way60 critics were unkind with the observer calling brandos performance one of the most extravagant displays of grandedamerie since sarah bernhardt61 while the sun complained marlon brando at fiftytwo has the sloppy belly of a sixtytwoyearold the white hair of a seventytwoyearold and the lack of discipline of a precocious twelveyearold61 however kanfer noted even though his late work was met with disapproval a reexamination shows that often in the middle of the most pedestrian scene there would be a sudden luminous occurrence a flash of the old marlon that showed how capable he remained61 in 1977 brando made a rare television appearance in the miniseries roots the next generations portraying george lincoln rockwell he won a primetime emmy award for outstanding supporting actor in a miniseries or a movie for his performance in 1978 he narrated the english version of raoni a frenchbelgian documentary film directed by jeanpierre dutilleux and luiz carlos saldanha that focused on the life of raoni metuktire and issues surrounding the survival of the indigenous indian tribes of north central brazil brando portrayed supermans father jorel in the 1978 film superman he agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part that he would not have to read the script beforehand and that his lines would be displayed somewhere offcamera it was revealed in a documentary contained in the 2001 dvd release of superman that he was paid 37 million for two weeks of work brando also filmed scenes for the movies sequel superman ii but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie he denied them permission to use the footage i asked for my usual percentage he recollected in his memoir but they refused and so did i however after brandos death the footage was reincorporated into the 2006 recut of the film superman ii the richard donner cut and in the 2006 loose sequel superman returns in which both used and unused archive footage of him as jorel from the first two superman films was remastered for a scene in the fortress of solitude and brandos voiceovers were used throughout the filmcitation needed in the 2015 documentary listen to me marlon brando claims to have rewritten most of the script this would be brandos last great film he would begin making poorer more outlandish character choices and being fed lines through an earpiece whether brando really did save the film after this he really would be difficult to work with not out of technique but out of laziness brando admits that his heart was no longer in it for the most part at this point in his career and with his family issues personal problems and social issues brando starred as colonel walter e kurtz in francis ford coppolas vietnam epic apocalypse now 1979 he plays a highly decorated us army special forces officer who goes renegade running his own operation based in cambodia and is feared by the us military as much as the vietnamese brando was paid 1 million a week for 3 weeks work the film drew attention for its lengthy and troubled production as eleanor coppolas documentary hearts of darkness a filmmakers apocalypse documents brando showed up on the set overweight martin sheen suffered a heart attack and severe weather destroyed several expensive sets the films release was also postponed several times while coppola edited millions of feet of footage in the documentary coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight brando turned up for his scenes and feeling desperate decided to portray kurtz who appears emaciated in the original story as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself coppola he was already heavy when i hired him and he promised me that he was going to get in shape and i imagined that i would if he were heavy i could use that but he was so fat he was very very shy about it  he was very very adamant about how he didnt want to portray himself that way brando admitted to coppola that he had not read the book heart of darkness as the director had asked him to and the pair spent days exploring the story and the character of kurtz much to the actors financial benefit according to producer fred roos the clock was ticking on this deal he had and we had to finish him within three weeks or wed go into this very expensive overage  and francis and marlon would be talking about the character and whole days would go by and this is at marlons urging—and yet hes getting paid for it upon release apocalypse now earned critical acclaim as did brandos performance his whispering of kurtzs final words the horror the horror has become particularly famous roger ebert writing in the chicago suntimes defended the movies controversial denouement opining that the ending with brandos fuzzy brooding monologues and final violence feels more satisfactory than any conventional ending possibly couldthis quote needs a citation later workedit after appearing as oil tycoon adam steiffel in 1980s the formula which was poorly received critically brando announced his retirement from acting however he returned in 1989 in a dry white season based on andré brinks 1979 antiapartheid novel brando agreed to do the film for free but fell out with

the picture so poorly i thought that the inherent drama of this conflict was vague at best brando received praise for his performance earning an academy award nomination for best supporting actor and winning the best actor award at the tokyo film festival brando also scored enthusiastic reviews for his caricature of his vito corleone role as carmine sabatini in 1990s the freshman in his original review roger ebert wrote there have been a lot of movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts—but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than marlon brando does in the freshman62

his appearance in christopher columbus the discovery 1992 for which he won a raspberry as worst supporting actor the island of dr moreau in which he was nominated for another worst actor raspberry

apartheid106 in 1964 he favored a boycott of his films in south africa to prevent them from being shown to a segregated audience he took part at a 1975 protest rally against american investments in south africa and for the release of nelson mandela107 in 1989 brando also starred in the film a dry white season based upon andré brinks novel of the same name comments on jews hollywood and israeledit in an interview in playboy magazine in january 1979 brando said youve seen every single race besmirched but you never saw an image of the kike because the jews were ever so watchful for that—and rightly so they never allowed it to be shown on screen the jews have done so much for the world that i suppose you get extra disappointed because they didnt pay attention to that108 brando made a similar comment on larry king live in april 1996 saying hollywood is run by jews it is owned by jews and they should have a greater sensitivity about the issue of—of people who are suffering because theyve exploited—we have seen the—we have seen the nigger and greaseball weve seen the chink weve seen the sliteyed dangerous jap we have seen the wily filipino weve seen everything but we never saw the kike because they knew perfectly well that that is where you draw the wagons around larry king who is jewish replied when you say—when you say something like that you are playing right in though to antisemitic people who say the jews are— brando interrupted no no because i will be the first one who will appraise the jews honestly and say thank god for the jews109 jay kanter brandos agent producer and friend defended him in daily variety marlon has spoken to me for hours about his fondness for the jewish people and he is a wellknown supporter of israel110 similarly louie kemp in his article for jewish journal wrote you might remember him as don vito corleone stanley kowalski or the eerie col walter e kurtz in apocalypse now but i remember marlon brando as a mensch and a personal friend of the jewish people when they needed it most28 in an interview with nbc today one day after brandos death king also defended brandos comments saying that they had been blown out of proportion and taken out of context legacyedit that will be brandos legacy whether he likes it or not—the stunning actor who embodied a poetry of anxiety that touched the deepest dynamics of his time and place —jack kroll in 1994 brando was one of the most respected actors of the postwar era he is listed by the american film institute as the fourth greatest male star whose screen debut occurred before or during 1950 it occurred in 1950 he earned respect among critics for his memorable performances and charismatic screen presence he helped to popularize method acting111 he is regarded as one of the greatest cinema actors of the 20th century112113114 encyclopedia britannica describes him as the most celebrated of the method actors and his slurred mumbling delivery marked his rejection of classical dramatic training his true and passionate performances proved him one of the greatest actors of his generation it also notes the apparent paradox of his talent he is regarded as the most influential actor of his generation yet his open disdain for the acting profession often manifested itself in the form of questionable choices and uninspired performances nevertheless he remains a riveting screen presence with a vast emotional range and an endless array of compulsively watchable idiosyncrasies115 cultural influenceedit he was our angry young man—the delinquent the tough the rebel—who stood at the center of our common experience —pauline kael116 madame tussauds waxwork exhibit of brando in the wild one albeit with a later 19578 model triumph thunderbird marlon brando is a cultural icon whose popularity has endured for over six decades his rise to national attention in the 1950s had a profound effect on american culture117 according to film critic pauline kael brando represented a reaction against the postwar mania for security as a protagonist the brando of the early fifties had no code only his instincts he was a development from the gangster leader and the outlaw he was antisocial because he knew society was crap he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap  brando represented a contemporary version of the free american  brando is still the most exciting american actor on the screen117 sociologist dr suzanne mcdonaldwalker states marlon brando sporting leather jacket jeans and moody glare became a cultural icon summing up the road in all its maverick glory118 his portrayal of the gang leader johnny strabler in the wild one has become an iconic image used both as a symbol of rebelliousness and a fashion accessory that includes a perfecto style motorcycle jacket a tilted cap jeans and sunglasses johnnys haircut inspired a craze for sideburns followed by james dean and elvis presley among others119 dean copied brandos acting style extensively and presley used brandos image as a model for his role in jailhouse rock120 the i coulda been a contender scene from on the waterfront according to the author of brooklyn boomer martin h levinson is one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history and the line itself has become part of americas cultural lexicon119 brandos powerful wild one image was still as of 2011 being marketed by the makers of his triumph thunderbird motorcycle in a range of clothing inspired by his character from the film and licensed by brandos estate121 brando was also considered a male sex symbol linda williams writes marlon brando was the quintessential american male sex symbol of the late fifties and early sixties122 views on actingedit in his autobiography songs my mother taught me brando observed ive always thought that one benefit of acting is that it gives actors a chance to express feelings that they are normally unable to vent in real life intense emotions buried inside you can come smoking out the back of your head and i suppose in terms of psychodrama this can be helpful in hindsight i guess my emotional insecurity as a child—the frustrations of not being allowed to be who i was of wanting love and not being able to get it of realizing that i was of no value—may have helped me as an actor at least in a small way it probably gave me a certain intensity that most people dont have123full citation needed he also confessed that while having great admiration for the theater he did not return to it after his initial success primarily because the work left him drained emotionally what i remember most about a streetcar named desire was the emotional grind of acting in it six nights and two afternoons try to imagine what it was like walking on stage at 830 every night having to yell scream cry break dishes kick the furniture punch the walls and experience the same intense wrenching emotions night after night trying each time to evoke in audiences the same emotions i felt it was exhausting123full citation needed brando repeatedly credited stella adler and her understanding of the stanislavsky acting technique for bringing realism to american cinema but also added this school of acting served the american theater and motion pictures well but it was restricting the american theater has never been able to present shakespeare or classical drama of any kind satisfactorily we simply do not have the style the regard for the language or the cultural disposition you cannot mumble in shakespeare you cannot improvise and you are required to adhere strictly to the text the english theater has a sense of language that we do not recognize in the united states the english language has developed almost into a patois123full citation needed in the 2015 documentary listen to me marlon brando shared his thoughts on playing a death scene stating thats a tough scene to play you have to make em believe that you are dying try to think of the most intimate moment youve ever had in your lifecitation needed brandos favorite actors were spencer tracy john barrymore fredric march james cagney and paul muni financial legacyedit upon his death in 2004 brando left an estate valued at 216 million124 brandos estate still earned about 9 million in 2005 the year following his death according to forbes that
