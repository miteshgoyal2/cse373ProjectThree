direct supervision of walt disney it was originally the only attraction on the property its official name was changed to disneyland park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s walt disney came up with the concept of disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s he initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit however he soon realized that the proposed site was too small after hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project disney bought a 160acre 65 ha site near anaheim in 1953 construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the abc television network on july 17

and the hard facts that have created america with the hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration to all the world — walter e disney july 17 19556789 history 20th century origins walt disney center showing orange county officials plans for disneylands layout december 1954 the concept for disneyland began when walt disney was visiting griffith park in los angeles with his daughters diane and sharon while watching them ride the merrygoround he came up with the idea of a place where adults and their children could go and have fun together though his dream lay dormant for many years10 he may have also been influenced by his fathers memories of the worlds columbian exposition of 1893 in chicago his father worked at the exposition the midway plaisance there included a set of attractions representing various countries from around the world and others representing various periods of man it also included many rides including the first ferris wheel a sky ride a passenger train that circled the perimeter and a wild west show another likely influence was benton harbor michigans nationally famous house of davids eden springs park disney visited the park and ultimately bought one of the older miniature trains originally used there the colony had the largest miniature railway setup in the world at the time11 the earliest documented draft of disneys plans was sent as a memo to studio production designer dick kelsey on august 31 1948 where it was referred to as a mickey mouse park based on notes walt made during his and ward kimballs trip to chicago railroad fair the same month with a twoday stop in henry fords museum and greenfield village a place with attractions like a main street and steamboat rides which he had visited eight years earlier12131415 while people wrote letters to disney about visiting the walt disney studios he realized that a functional movie studio had little to offer to visiting fans and began to foster ideas of building a site near the burbank studios for tourists to visit his ideas evolved to a small play park with a boat ride and other themed areas the initial concept the mickey mouse park started with an 8acre 32 ha plot across riverside drive he started to visit other parks for inspiration and ideas including tivoli gardens in denmark efteling in the netherlands and greenfield village playland and childrens fairyland in the united states and according to the film director ken annakin in his autobiography so you want to be a film director bekonscot model village railway beaconsfield england his designers began working on concepts though the project grew much larger than the land could hold16 disney hired harrison price from stanford research institute to gauge the proper area to locate the theme park based on the areas potential growth based on prices analysis for which he would be recognized as a disney legend in 2003 disney acquired 160 acres 65 ha of orange groves and walnut trees in anaheim southeast of los angeles in neighboring orange county1617 the burbank site originally considered by disney is now home to walt disney animation studios and abc studios difficulties in obtaining funding prompted disney to investigate new methods of fundraising and he decided to create a show named disneyland it was broadcast on thenfledgling abc in return the network agreed to help finance the park for its first five years of operation disneyland was owned by disneyland inc which was jointly owned by walt disney productions walt disney western publishing and abc18 in addition disney rented out many of the shops on main street usa to outside companies by 1960 walt disney productions bought out all other shares a partnership which would eventually lead to the walt disney corporations acquisition of abc in the mid1990s in 1952 the proposed project had been called disneylandia but disney followed abcs advice and changed it to disneyland two years later when excavation of the site began19 construction began on july 16 1954 and cost 17 million to complete the park was opened one year and one day later20 us route 101 later interstate 5 was under construction at the same time just north of the site in preparation for the traffic disneyland was expected to bring two more lanes were added to the freeway before the park was finished17 opening day disneyland was dedicated at an international press preview event held on sunday july 17 1955 which was only open to invited guests and the media although 28000 people attended the event only about half of those were actual invitees the rest having purchased counterfeit tickets21 or even sneaked into the park by climbing over the fence22 the following day it opened to the public featuring twenty attractions the special sunday events including the dedication were televised nationwide and anchored by three of walt disneys friends from hollywood art linkletter bob cummings and ronald reagan abc broadcast the event live during which many guests tripped over the television camera cables23 in frontierland a camera caught cummings kissing a dancer when disney started to read the plaque for tomorrowland he read partway then stopped when a technician offcamera said something to him and after realizing he was onair said i thought i got a signal23 and began the dedication from the start at one point while in fantasyland linkletter tried to give coverage to cummings who was on the pirate ship he was not ready and tried to give the coverage back to linkletter who had lost his microphone cummings then did a playbyplay of him trying to find it in front of mr toads wild ride23 traffic was delayed on the twolane harbor boulevard23 famous figures who were scheduled to show up every two hours showed up all at once the temperature was an unusually high 101 °f 38 °c and because of a local plumbers strike disney was given a choice of having working drinking fountains or running toilets he chose the latter leaving many drinking fountains dry this generated negative publicity since pepsi sponsored the parks opening disappointed guests believed the inoperable fountains were a cynical way to sell soda while other vendors ran out of food the asphalt that had been poured that morning was soft enough to let womens highheeled shoes sink into it some parents threw their children over the crowds shoulders to get them onto rides such as the king arthur carrousel24 in later years disney and his 1955 executives referred to july 17 1955 as black sunday after the extremely negative press from the preview opening walt disney invited attendees back for a private second day to experience disneyland properly the next day the parks official public opening day crowds gathered in line as early as 200 am the first person to buy a ticket and enter the park was david macpherson with ticket number 2 as roy o disney arranged to prepurchase ticket number 1 from curtis lineberry the manager of admissions however an official picture of walt disney and two children christine vess watkins age 5 and michael schwartner 7 inaccurately identifies them as the first two guests of disneyland both received lifetime passes to disneyland that day and macpherson was awarded one shortly thereafter which was later expanded to every single disneyowned park in the world approximately 50000 guests attended the monday opening daycitation needed at the time and during the lifetimes of walt and roy disney july 17 was considered merely a preview with july 18 the official opening day22 since then aided by memories of the television broadcast the company has adopted july 17 as the official date the one commemorated every year as disneylands birthday22 1950s and 1960s disneyland aerial view 1963 which includes the new

hollywoods top boxoffice draw due to the cold war tension and security concerns he was famously denied an excursion to disneyland25 the shah of iran and empress farah were invited to disneyland by walt disney in the early 1960s there was moderate controversy over the lack of african american employees as late as 1963 civil rights activists were pressuring disneyland to hire black people26 with executives responding that they would consider the requestscitation needed the park did however hire people of asian descent such as ty wong and bob kuwahara27 as part of the casa de fritos operation

repurposed by these projects the sixlevel 10250space mickey and friends parking structure was constructed in the northwest corner upon completion in 2000 it was the largest parking structure in the united states29 the parks management team during the mid1990s was a source of controversy among fans and employees in an effort to boost profits various changes were begun by thenexecutives cynthia harriss and paul pressler while their initiatives provided a shortterm increase in shareholder returns they drew widespread criticism for their lack of foresight the retail backgrounds of harriss and pressler led to a gradual shift in disneylands focus from attractions to merchandising outside consultants mckinsey company were brought in to help streamline operations resulting in many changes and cutbacks after nearly a decade of deferred maintenance the original park was showing signs of neglect fans of the park decried the perceived decline in customer value and park quality and rallied for

time as of march 2007 mickey and his toon friends no longer climb the matterhorn but the climbing program continues every evening at dusk there is a militarystyle flag retreat to lower the us flag by a ceremonial detail of disneylands security staff the ceremony is usually held between 400 and 500 pm depending on the entertainment being offered on main street usa to prevent conflicts with crowds and music disney does report the time the flag retreat is scheduled on its times guide offered at the entrance turnstiles and other locations the disneyland band which has been part of the park since its opening plays the role of the town band on main street usa it also breaks out into smaller groups like the main street strawhatters the hook and ladder co and the pearly band in fantasyland however on march 31 2015 the disneyland resort notified the band members of an end of run the reason for doing so is that they would start a new higher energy band the veteran band members were invited to audition for the new disneyland band and were told that even if they did not make the new band or audition they would still play in small groups around the park this sparked some controversy with supporters of the traditional band48 fantasmic finale on july 4 2010 fantasmic which debuted in 1992 is a popular multimedia nighttime show on the rivers of america the star mickey

about 41000 per night on the fireworks show the show is normally offered at 845 or 930 pm if the park is scheduled to close at 10 pm or later but shows have started as early as 545 pm a major consideration is weatherwinds especially at higher elevations which can and often will force the delay or cancellation of the show with a few minor exceptions such as july 4 and new years eve shows must finish by 10 pm due to the conditions of the permit issued by the city of anaheim the golden horseshoe saloon offers a live stage show with an old west feel the golden horseshoe revue was an

attractions was in addition to the price of park admission62 guests paid a small admission fee to get into the park but admission to most of the rides and attractions required guests to purchase tickets either individually or in a book that consisted of several coupons initially labeled a through c a coupons allowed admission to the smaller rides and attractions such as the main street vehicles whereas c coupons were used for the most common attractions like peter pans flight or the mad tea party as more thrilling rides were introduced such as the disneyland monorail or the matterhorn bobsleds d and then eventually e coupons were introduced coupons could be combined to equal the equivalent of another ticket eg two a tickets equal one b ticket from the thrill ride experience at disneyland the colloquial expression an e ticket ride is used to describe any exceptionally thrilling experience disneyland later featured a keys to the kingdom booklet of tickets which consisted of 10 unvalued coupons sold for a single flat rate these coupons could be used for any attraction regardless of its regular value in 1982 disney dropped the idea for individual ride tickets to a single admission price with unlimited access to all attractions except shooting galleries63 while this idea was not original to disney its business advantages were obvious in addition to guaranteeing that everyone paid a large sum even if they stayed for only a few hours and rode only a few rides the park no longer had to print tickets or ticket books staff ticket booths or provide staff to collect tickets or monitor attractions for people sneaking on without tickets later disney introduced other entry options such as multiday passes annual passes which allow unlimited entry to
