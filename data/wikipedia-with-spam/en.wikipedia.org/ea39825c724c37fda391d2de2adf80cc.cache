overviewedit due to high demands on the group the roles of jackie tito jermaine marlon and michael were played by voice actors with records of the groups songs being used for the musical tracks of the show the group did make some contribution to the cartoon in the form of live photographs of each member morphing into a cartoon which was shown in the title screen medley although the musical scenes of the cartoon were chiefly animation an occasional liveaction footage of a concert or music video of the jackson 5 would be spliced into the cartoon series the actual jackson 5 also contributed to the show by posing for pictures prior to the cartoons debut which were used as posters newspaper clips and tv guide spots advertising the forthcoming tv series though berry gordy did not provide the original voice his character was voiced by paul frees nor advertised his name his character was frequently involved as the adult figure to the group rbpop singer diana ross contributed to voice her fictionalized self in the debut episode the premise of the show is that the jackson five would have adventures similar to josie and the pussycats alvin the chipmunks or the partridge family with the unique addition being that berry gordy the manager of the band in the shows universe would come up with an idea for publicity for the band such as having to do farm work or play a concert for the president of the united states the series was followed by the jacksons a live action show in 1976 musicedit a specially recorded medley of five jackson 5 1 hits—i want you back the love you save abc

laugh trackedit main article laugh track like most 1970sera saturday morning cartoon series the jackson 5ive contained an adult laugh track rankinbass experimented with creating their own laugh track a practice hannabarbera had implemented in 1971 this was done to avoid paying large fees to charley douglass who edited laugh tracks onto the majority of network television shows at the time like hannabarbera rankinbass isolated several snippets of canned chuckles from douglass’ library and inserted them onto the soundtrack the laughs initially consisted of only loud eruptions mild jokes received unnatural bouts of laughter while other times the laughter would erupt midsentence the studio had improved the process by the second season using more modulated laughs culled from douglasss 19711972 library laughs did not erupt midsentence like the first season and were better timed by rankinbass sound engineers1 unlike hannabarberas laugh track rankinbass provided a larger variety of laughs1 rankinbass ceased using laugh tracks after the jackson 5ive ended its original run in 19731 castedit actor role paul frees berry gordy additional voices donald fullilove michael jackson edmund
