match the mls cup the club with the best regular season record received nothing more than the top seed in the playoffs in 1997 soccer fan nick lawrus proposed the notion of a supporters scudetto as a result of the tampa bay mutiny earning the best regular season record but failing to win the 1996 mls cup final a committee composed of members of all mls teams supporters changed the name to supporterss shield but due to disagreements between members of the committee the proposal failed to come to fruition1 the following year another group led by soccer enthusiast sam pierron tried to revive the idea by giving an award to the regular season champions1 since mls refused to fund the idea pierron began fundraising to purchase a trophy with the help of supporters from various mls clubs fundraising was boosted with the assistance of espns mls commentator at the time phil schoen donating for the award in the end nearly 3000 was donated to commission the trophy which was made by artist paula richardson out of sterling silver sheet metal for 22002 the money donated to create and purchase the trophy was not fulfilled until the tail end of the 1999 season when the second mls supporters
