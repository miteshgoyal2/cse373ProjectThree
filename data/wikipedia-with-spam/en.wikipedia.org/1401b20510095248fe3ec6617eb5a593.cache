see also jon stewarts 2009 criticism of cnbc cnbc has been criticized for allegedly amplifying bull and bear markets particularly in the runup to the dotcom bubble and the subprime crisis8788 in response to these criticisms cnbc anchors have pointed to the size of the market and noted that influencing it is a little out of our reach87 jon stewart on comedy centrals the daily show has been a vocal critic of cnbc and some of its personalities beginning after comments were made by rick santelli8990 despite the lack of direct comments by the network several personalities have defended their predictions and comments9192 cnbc was accused by the obama administration of cable chatter—the excessive and sometimes brutal discussion on a particular topic often onesided9394 jim cramers stock picks on his cnbc show mad money were found by barrons magazine in 2007 to have underperformed the sp 500 stock index over the previous two years barrons stated that his picks havent beaten the market over the past two years viewers holding cramers stocks would be up 12 while the dow rose 22 and the sp 500 16 cnbc disputed the magazines findings95 cnbc was criticized for restricting public access to the third republican presidential debate aired on october 28 2015 by refusing to temporarily suspend their tv everywhere authentication system to allow all viewers to stream the event96 the network also received bipartisan criticism for its performance hosting the debate along with a poorly planned format at one point when asked how it was determined who would follow up becky quick admitted there was no method other than the moderators discretion the hosts were accused of being snarky with the candidates asking insulting or pointless questions using incorrect or unchecked facts and inserting themselves into the debate rather than simply moderating97 host john harwood received the brunt of the criticism for his line of questioning for example he started the debate by asking donald trump if his campaign was a comic book and later compared his ideas to a bird flying away and use of incorrect facts he used incorrect numbers when discussing marco rubios tax plan which rubio had to correct him on and even pointed out that harwood had recently written an article on the same topic and had to correct it then as well98 some deemed cnbc as the main loser of debate for allowing the candidates to unify against them and for solidifying claims of anticonservative bias from the mainstream media99 citing the need to prevent a repeat of the event the republican national committee revoked tentative plans for a future debate on nbc itself with nbc news and the network did not carry any republican debates during the 2016 primary campaign100 see alsoedit bloomberg television fox
