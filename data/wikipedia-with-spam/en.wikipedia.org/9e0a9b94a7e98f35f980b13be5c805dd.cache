of chicago as checagou was by robert de lasalle around 1679 in a memoir22 henri joutel in his journal of 1688 noted that the wild garlic called chicagoua grew abundantly in the area23 according to his diary of late september 1687 when we arrived at the said place called chicagou which according to what we were able to learn of it has taken this name because of the quantity of garlic which grows in the forests in this region23 in the mid18th century the area was inhabited by a native american tribe known as the potawatomi who had taken the place of the miami and sauk and fox peoples24 the first known nonindigenous permanent settler in chicago was jean baptiste point du sable du sable was of african and french descent and arrived in the 1780s252627 he is commonly known as the founder of

the kansas–nebraska act and the popular sovereignty approach to the issue of the spread of slavery40 these issues also helped propel another illinoisan abraham lincoln to the national stage lincoln was nominated in chicago for us president at the 1860 republican national convention he defeated douglas in the general election and this set the stage for the american civil war to accommodate rapid population growth and demand for better sanitation the city improved its infrastructure in february 1856 chicagos common council approved chesbroughs plan to build the united states first comprehensive sewerage system41 the project raised much of central chicago to a new grade while elevating chicago and at first improving the citys health the untreated sewage and industrial waste now flowed into the chicago river then into lake michigan polluting the citys primary freshwater source the city responded by tunneling two miles 3 km out into lake michigan to newlybuilt water cribs in 1900 the problem of sewage contamination was largely resolved when the city completed a major engineering feat it reversed the flow of the chicago river so the water flowed away from lake michigan rather than into it this project began with the construction and improvement of the illinois and michigan canal and was completed with the chicago sanitary and ship canal that connects to the illinois river which flows into the mississippi river424344 in 1871 the great chicago fire destroyed an area of about 4 miles long and 1 mile wide a large section of the city at the time454647 much of the city
