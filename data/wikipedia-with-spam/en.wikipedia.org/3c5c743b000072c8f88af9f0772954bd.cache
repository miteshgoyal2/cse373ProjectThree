a google maps camera car showcased on the google campus in mountain view california in october 2010 a google car captures itself in a street mirror in nagiso nagano japan cameras street view imagery has come from several generations of camera systems from immersive media 1 point grey research now flir systems 2 and developed inhouse29 the cameras contain no mechanical parts including the shutter instead using cmos sensors and an electronic rolling shutter widely deployed versions are r2 the earliest after immersive media photos were captured with a ring of eight 11megapixel ccd sensors with commercial photographic wideangle lenses cameras with the same specs as those used for the google books project ladybug2 cameras resolution 1024 x 768 pixels by point grey research30 r5 uses a ring of eight 5megapixel cmos cameras by elphel3132 with custom lowflare lenses plus a camera with fisheye lens on top to capture upper levels of buildings r7 is the first completely inhouse built camera it

to 50 meters 180° in the front of the vehicle34 these are used for recording the actual dimensions of the space being photographed lidar scanners from velodyne were added in the 2017 update mounted at 45° to capture 3d depth information and used for additional positional information33 vehicles data recording equipment is usually mounted on the roof of a car a trike tricycle was developed to record pedestrian routes including stonehenge and other unesco world heritage sites in 2010 a snowmobilebased system captured the 2010 winter olympics sites29 trolleys have been used to shoot the insides of museums and in venice the narrow roads were photographed with backpackmounted cameras and canals were photographed from boats35 a portable backpack google trekker is used in outdoor terrain for instance the six main paths up snowdon were mapped by the google trekker in 201536 pegman as noted above the draganddrop pegman icon is the primary user interface element used by google to connect

peg friends in google maps when dragged into street view near area 51 he becomes a flying saucer when viewing older views the pegman in the minimap changes to doc brown from back to the futurecitation needed pegman has occasionally appeared as a costumed character at google events such as the launch of street view in france in 2008citation needed privacy concerns a street view car parked at a subaru service center in jersey city new jersey main article google street view privacy concerns google street view will blur houses for any user who makes a request in addition to the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates37 privacy advocates have objected to the google street view pointing to views found to show men leaving strip clubs protesters at an abortion clinic sunbathers in bikinis and people engaging in activities visible from public property in which they do not wish to be seen publicly38 another concern is the height of the cameras and in at least two countries japan39 and switzerland40 google has had to lower the height of its cameras so as to not peer over fences and hedges the service also allows users themselves to flag inappropriate or sensitive imagery for google to review and remove41 police scotland received an apology for wasting police time in 2014 from a local business owner in edinburgh who in 2012 had staged a fake murder for the google camera car by lying in the road while his colleague stood over him with a pickaxe handle42 in may 2010 it was revealed that google had collected and stored payload data from unencrypted wifi connections as part of street view43 german authorities are considering legal action while the foreign minister said i will do all i can to prevent it australian police have also been ordered to investigate44 the concerns have led to google not providing or suspending the service in countries around the world austria google street view was banned in austria because google was found to collect wifi data unauthorized in 2010 after the ban was lifted rules were set up for how street view can operate legally in austria google has yet to resume service officially it welcomed the new guidelines but has ruled out operating under them as of 2016 google street view is still unavailable45 australia in 2010 google street view ceased operations in australia following months of investigations from australian authorities46 however this cessation has since ended with google announcing plans to continue production on may 4 201147 and subsequently releasing updated street view imagery for australian towns and cities on july 27 201148 germany in 2011 after having put online the pictures of the 20 largest cities google stopped taking street view images in germany49 india in 2011 google stopped taking street images in india after receiving a letter from police authorities in bangalore50 canada street view cars had been spotted as early as september 2007 in montréal though service for canada was delayed while attempting to settle with the canadian government over its privacy laws privacy and town beauty concerns were dealt with and street view is available in montréal and other canadian cities as of 2016citation needed thirdparty use of images fineart photographers have selected images for use in their own work51 although the images may be pixelated the colours muddy and the perspective warped the photographs have been published in book form and exhibited in art galleries such as the work of jon rafman at the saatchi gallery london52 in his personal appreciation of street view material rafman sees images which evoke the gritty urban life depicted in american street photography and the images commissioned by the farm security administration he also invokes the decisive moment esthetic of henri cartierbresson as if i were a photojournalist responding instantaneously to an emerging event53 michael wolf won an honourable mention in daily life in the 2011 world press photo competition for some of his work using google street view54 mishka henner was shortlisted for the 2013 deutsche börse photography prize in november 2012 for his series no mans land which depicts
