war in europe made return there unlikely she began to view the film industry as a way of assimilating to american society13 francis taylors beverly hills gallery had gained clients from the film

kid has nothing  her eyes are too old she doesnt have the face of a child17 biographer alexander walker agrees that taylor looked different from the child stars of the era such as shirley temple and judy garland18 and she herself later explained that apparently i used to frighten grown ups because i was totally direct19 taylor received another opportunity in late 1942 when her fathers

of her life192627 she described the studio as a big extended factory where she was required to adhere to a strict daily schedule19 days were spent attending school and filming at the studio lot and evenings in dancing and singing classes and in practising the following days scenes27 following the success of national velvet mgm gave taylor a new sevenyear contract with a weekly salary of 750 and

adaptation of louisa m alcotts novel it was a boxoffice success35 the same year time featured her on its cover and called her the leader among hollywoods next generation of stars a jewel of great price a true sapphire36 transition to adult roles 1950–1951edit taylor made the transition to adult roles in 1950 the year she turned 18 her first mature role was playing a woman who begins to suspect that her husband is a soviet spy in the thriller conspirator 194937 taylor had been only 16 at the time of its filming but its release was delayed until march 1950 as mgm disliked it and feared it could cause diplomatic problems3738 taylors second film of 1950 was the comedy the big hangover 1950 costarring van johnson39 it was released in may and the same month taylor married hotelchain heir conrad hilton jr in a highly publicized ceremony40 the event was organized by mgm and used as part of the publicity campaign for taylors next film vincente minnellis comedy father of the bride 1950 in which she appeared opposite spencer tracy and joan bennett as a bride preparing for her wedding40 the film became a boxoffice success upon its release in june grossing 6 million worldwide and was followed by a successful sequel fathers little dividend 1951 ten months later41 with montgomery clift in a place in the sun 1951 taylors next film release george stevens a place in the sun 1951 marked a departure from her earlier films according to taylor it was the first film in which she had been asked to act instead of simply being herself26 and it brought her critical acclaim for the first time since national velvet42 based on theodore dreisers novel an american tragedy 1925 it featured taylor as a spoiled socialite who comes between a poor factory worker montgomery clift and his girlfriend shelley winters43 stevens cast taylor as she was the only one  who could create this illusion of being not so much a real girl as the girl on the candybox cover the beautiful girl in the yellow cadillac convertible that every american boy sometime or other thinks he can marry44 a place in the sun was a critical and commercial success grossing 3 million45 herb golden of variety stated that taylors the histrionics are of a quality so far beyond anything she has done previously that stevens skilled hands on the reins must be credited with a minor miracle46 and ah weiler of the new york times wrote that she gives a shaded tender performance and one in which her passionate and genuine romance avoids the bathos common to young love as it sometimes comes to the screen47 continued success at mgm 1952–1955edit taylor next starred in the romantic comedy love is better than ever 195248 according to alexander walker mgm cast her in the bpicture as a reprimand for divorcing hilton in january 1951 after only nine months of marriage which had caused a public scandal that reflected negatively on her48 after completing love is better than ever taylor was sent to britain to take part in the historical epic ivanhoe 1952 which was one of the most expensive projects in the studios history49 she was not happy about the project finding the story superficial and her role as rebecca too small49 regardless ivanhoe became one of mgms biggest commercial successes earning 11 million in worldwide rentals50 taylors last film made under her old contract with mgm was the girl who had everything 1953 a remake of the precode drama a free soul 193151 despite her grievances with the studio she signed a new sevenyear contract with mgm in the summer of 195252 although she wanted more interesting roles the decisive factor in continuing with the studio was her financial need she had recently married british actor michael wilding and was pregnant with her first child52 in addition to granting her a weekly salary of 4700 mgm agreed to give the couple a loan for a house and signed wilding for a threeyear contract53 due to her financial dependency the studio now had even more control over her than previously53 taylor and van johnson in the romantic drama the last time i saw paris 1954 taylors first two films made under her new contract were released ten days apart in spring 195454 the first was rhapsody a romantic film starring her as a woman caught in a love triangle with two musicians the second was elephant walk a drama in which she played a british woman struggling to adapt to life on her husbands tea plantation in ceylon she had been loaned to paramount pictures for the film after its original star vivien leigh fell ill55 in the fall taylor starred in two more film releases beau brummell was a regency era period film another project in which she was cast against her will56 taylor disliked historical films in general as their elaborate costumes and makeup required her to wake up earlier than usual to prepare and later stated that she gave one of the worst performances of her career in beau brummell56 the second film was richard brooks the last time i saw paris based on f scott fitzgeralds short story although she had instead wanted to be cast in the barefoot contessa 1954 taylor liked the film and later stated that it convinced me i wanted to be an actress instead of yawning my way through parts57 while the last time i saw paris was not as profitable as many other mgm films it garnered positive reviews57 taylor became pregnant again during the production and had to agree to add another year to her contract to make up for the period spent on maternity leave58 critical acclaim 1956–1960edit taylor and rock hudson in giant 1956 by the mid1950s the american film industry was beginning to face serious competition from television which resulted in studios producing fewer films and focusing instead on their quality59 the change benefited taylor who finally found interesting roles after several years of career disappointments59 after lobbying director george stevens she won the female lead role in giant 1956 an epic drama about a ranching dynasty which costarred rock hudson and james dean59 its filming in marfa texas was a difficult experience for taylor as she clashed with stevens who wanted to break her will to make her easier to direct and was often ill resulting in delays60 to further complicate the production dean died in a car accident only days after completing filming grieving taylor still had to film reaction shots to their joint scenes61 when giant was released a year later it became a boxoffice success and was widely praised by critics59 although not nominated for an academy award like her costars taylors performance also garnered positive reviews with variety calling it surprisingly clever62 and the manchester guardian lauded it as an astonishing revelation of unsuspected gifts and naming her one of the films strongest assets63 mgm next reunited taylor with montgomery clift in raintree county 1957 a civil war drama it hoped would replicate the success of gone with the wind 193964 taylor found her role as a mentally disturbed southern belle fascinating but overall disliked the film64 although the film failed to become the type of success mgm had planned65 taylor was nominated for the first time for an academy award for best actress for her performance66 promotional poster for cat on a hot tin roof 1958 taylor considered her next performance as maggie the cat in the screen adaptation of the tennessee williams play cat on a hot tin roof 1958 a career high point although it coincided with one of the most difficult periods in her personal life26 after completing raintree country she had divorced wilding and married producer mike todd she had completed only two weeks of filming in march 1958 when todd was killed in a plane crash67 although she was devastated pressure from the studio and the knowledge that todd had large debts led taylor to return to work only three weeks later68 she later stated that she in a way  became maggie and that acting was the only time i could function in the weeks after todds death26 during the production taylors personal life drew further public attention when she began an affair with singer eddie fisher whose marriage to actress debbie reynolds had been idealized by the media as the union of americas sweethearts69 the affair and fishers subsequent divorce changed taylors public image from a grieving widow to a homewrecker mgm used the scandal to its advantage by featuring an image of taylor posing on a bed in a négligée in the films promotional posters69 cat grossed 10 million in american cinemas alone and made taylor the years secondmost profitable star69 she received positive reviews for her performance with bosley crowther of the new york times calling her terrific70 and variety praising her for a wellaccented perceptive interpretation71 taylor was nominated for an academy award66 and a bafta72 promotional poster for butterfield 8 for which taylor won her first academy award taylors next film joseph l mankiewicz suddenly last summer 1959 was another tennessee williams adaptation and costarred montgomery clift and katharine hepburn the independent production earned taylor 500000 for playing the role of a severely traumatized patient in a mental institution69 although the film was a drama about mental illness childhood traumas and homosexuality it was again promoted with taylors sex appeal both its trailer and poster featured her in a white swimsuit the strategy worked as the film became a financial success73 taylor received her third academy award nomination66 and her first golden globe for best actress for her performance69 by 1959 taylor owed one more film for mgm which it decided should be butterfield 8 1960 a drama about a highclass prostitute74 the studio correctly calculated that taylors public image would make it easy for audiences to associate her with the role74 she hated the film for the same reason but had no choice in the matter although the studio agreed to her demands of filming in new york and casting eddie fisher in a sympathetic role74 as predicted butterfield 8 was a major commercial success grossing 18 million in world rentals75 crowther wrote that taylor looks like a million dollars in mink or in negligée76 while variety stated that she gives a torrid stinging portrayal with one or two brilliantly executed passages within77 taylor also won the academy award for best actress for her performance75 cleopatra and other films with richard burton 1961–1967edit taylor as cleopatra with richard burton as mark anthony in cleopatra 1963 after completing her mgm contract taylor starred in 20th centuryfoxs cleopatra 1963—a historical epic which according to film historian alexander doty made her more famous than ever before78 she became the first actress to be paid 1 million for a role fox also granted her 10 of the films profits as well as shooting the film in toddao a widescreen format for which she had inherited the rights from mike todd79 the films production—characterized by costly sets and costumes constant delays and a scandal caused by taylors extramarital affair with her costar richard burton—was closely followed by the media with life proclaiming it the most talked about movie ever made80 filming first began in england in 1960 but had to be halted several times due to bad weather and taylors ill health81 in march 1961 she developed nearly fatal pneumonia which necessitated a tracheotomy one news agency even erroneously reported that she had died81 once she had recovered fox discarded the already filmed material and moved the production to rome changing its director to joseph mankiewicz and the actor playing mark antony to burton82 filming was finally completed in july 196283 the films final cost was 62 million making it the most expensive film made up to that point84 cleopatra became the biggest boxoffice success of 1963 in the united states grossing 157 million85 regardless it took several years for the film to earn back its production costs which drove fox near to bankruptcy the studio which publicly blamed taylor for the productions troubles unsuccessfully sued burton and her for allegedly damaging the film with their behavior84 the films reviews were mixed to negative with critics finding taylor overweight and her voice too thin and unfavorably comparing her with her classically trained british costars86 in retrospect taylor called cleopatra a low point in her career and stated that the studio cut out the scenes which provided the core of the characterization26 taylor and burton in the sandpiper 1965 taylor intended on following cleopatra by headlining an allstar cast in foxs black comedy what a way to go 1964 but negotiations fell through and shirley maclaine was cast instead in the meantime film producers were eager to profit from the scandal surrounding taylor and burton and they next starred together in anthony asquiths the vips 1963 which mirrored the headlines about them87 taylor played a famous model attempting to leave her husband for a lover and burton her estranged millionaire husband released soon after cleopatra it became a boxoffice success88 taylor was also paid 500000 to appear in a cbs television special elizabeth taylor in london in which she visited the citys landmarks and recited passages from the works of famous british writers89 after completing the vips taylor took a twoyear hiatus from films during which burton and she divorced their spouses and married each other90 the supercouple continued starring together in films in the mid1960s earning a combined 88 million over the next decade burton once stated they say we generate more business activity than one of the smaller african nations9192 alexander walker compared these films to illustrated gossip columns as their film roles often reflected their public personae while doty has noted that the majority of taylors films during this period seemed to conform to and reinforce the image of an indulgent raucous immoral or amoral and appetitive in many senses of the word elizabeth taylor93 taylor and burtons first joint project following her hiatus was vincente minellis romantic drama the sandpiper 1965 about an illicit love affair between a bohemian artist and a married clergyman in the big sur its reviews were largely negative but it grossed a successful 14 million in the box office94 their next project whos afraid of virginia woolf 1966 featured the most critically acclaimed performance of taylors career95 she and burton starred as martha and george a middleaged couple going through a marital crisis to convincingly play 50yearold martha taylor gained weight wore a wig and used makeup to make herself look old and tired—in stark contrast to her public image as a glamorous film star96 at taylors suggestion theater director mike nichols was hired to direct the project despite his lack of experience with film97 the production differed from anything she had done previously as nichols wanted to thoroughly rehearse the play before beginning filming98 woolf was considered groundbreaking for its adult themes and uncensored language and opened to glorious reviews99 variety wrote that taylors characterization is at once sensual spiteful cynical pitiable loathsome lustful and tender100 and stanley kauffman of the new york times stated that she does the best work of her career sustained and urgent101 the film also became one of the biggest commercial successes of the year102 taylor received her second academy award a bafta a national board of review and a new york city film critics circle awards for her performance in 1966 taylor and burton also performed doctor faustus for a week in oxford to benefit the oxford university dramatic society he starred and she appeared in her first stage role as helen of troy a part which required no speaking103 although it received generally negative reviews burton produced it into a film doctor faustus 1967 with the same cast103 it was also panned by critics and grossed only 600000 in the box office104 taylor and burtons next project franco zeffirellis the taming of the shrew 1967 which they also coproduced was more successful105 it posed another challenge for taylor as she was the only actor in the project with no previous experience of performing shakespeare zeffirelli later stated that this made her performance interesting as she invented the part from scratch106 critics found the play to be fitting material for the couple and the film became a boxoffice success by grossing 12 million107 taylors third film released in 1967 john hustons reflections in a golden eye was her first without burton since cleopatra it was a drama about a repressed homosexual and his unfaithful wife and was originally slated to costar taylors old friend montgomery clift his career had been in decline for several years due to his substanceabuse problems but taylor was determined to secure his involvement in the project even offering to pay for his insurance108 however clift died from a heart attack before filming began he was replaced by marlon brando109 reflections was a critical and commercial failure at the time of its release110 taylor and burtons last film of the year was the graham greene adaptation the comedians which received mixed reviews and was a boxoffice disappointment111 career decline 1968–1979edit taylor in 1971 by the late 1960s taylors career was in decline she had gained weight and was nearing middle age and did not fit in with the new generation of stars such as jane fonda and julie christie112 after several years of nearly constant media attention the public was also tiring of burton and her and criticized their jet set lifestyle113 in 1968 taylor starred in two films directed by joseph losey boom and secret ceremony both of which were critical and commercial failures114 the former based on tennessee williams the milk train doesnt stop here anymore features her as an aging serialmarrying millionaire and burton as a younger man who turns up on the mediterranean island on which she has retired115 secret ceremony is a psychological drama which also stars mia farrow and robert mitchum116 taylors third film with george stevens the only game in town 1970 in which she played a las vegas showgirl who has an affair with a compulsive gambler played by warren beatty was unsuccessful117118 the three films in which taylor acted in 1972 were somewhat more successful zee and co which portrayed michael caine and her as a troubled married couple won her the david di donatello for best foreign actress she then appeared with burton in the dylan thomas adaptation under milk wood although her role was small its producers decided to give her topbilling to profit from her fame119 her third film role that year was playing a blonde diner waitress in peter ustinovs faust parody hammersmith is out her tenth collaboration with burton although it was overall not successful120 taylor received some good reviews with vincent canby of the new york times writing that she has a certain vulgar ratty charm121 and roger ebert of the chicago suntimes stating the spectacle of elizabeth taylor growing older and more beautiful continues to amaze the population122 her performance won the silver bear for best actress at the berlin

and tony curtis128 wanting to challenge herself she then appeared in her first substantial stage role playing regina giddens in a broadway production of lillian hellmans the little foxes129 instead of portraying giddens in negative light as had often been the case in previous productions taylors idea was to show her as a victim of circumstance explaining shes a killer but shes saying sorry fellas you put me in this position130 the production premiered in may 1981 and had a soldout sixmonth run despite mixed reviews129 frank rich of the new york times wrote that taylors performance as regina giddens that malignant southern bitchgoddess  begins gingerly soon gathers steam and then explodes into a black and thunderous storm that may just knock you out of your seat131 while dan sullivan of the los angeles times stated taylor presents a possible regina giddens as seen through the persona of elizabeth taylor theres some acting in it as well as some personal display132 she appeared as evil
