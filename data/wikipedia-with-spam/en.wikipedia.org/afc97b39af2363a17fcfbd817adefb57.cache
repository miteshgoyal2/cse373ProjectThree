district in the greater seattle metropolitan areacitation needed during the late 1990s and early 2000s the cities of redmond snoqualmie fall city issaquah and bellevue have grown substantially the town of sammamish was incorporated in 1999 because of suburban growth ecology and conservationedit historically runoff from the high precipitation in the lakes watershed nearly twice the 35 inches that seattle gets each year was absorbed by the surrounding forests1 loose spongelike forest soils virtually eliminated runoff during winter storms and recharged groundwater aquifers which then released fresh water to streams in the dry summer months with rapid urbanization the forests have been replaced by impervious surfaces—roofs roads parking lots—and stormwater runoffs have increased flooding2 the stormwater runoff carries sediment loads and toxic pollutants into streams and ultimately the lake which generally has a negative impact on lake water clarity as well as fishes and wildlife23 in may 2010 the federal government asked the town of sammamish to restrict development within 250 feet 76 m from the lakeshore to protect local salmon and steelhead oncorhyncus mykiss species the report did not include lake sammamish kokanee salmon oncorhyncus nerka among the species in trouble although environmentalists and scientists said development along lake sammamish and tributary creeks have pushed the fish to the brink of extirpation4 despite resistance to the report by the city of sammamish issaquah already limits development within 200 feet 61 m of the lake issaquah creek and the east fork of issaquah creek under the shoreline management program4 it is estimated that fewer than 100 kokanee salmon remain in lake sammamish5 beaversedit the recent return of beaver castor canadensis to lake sammamish worries city of issaquah and lake sammamish state park officials who state that the mammals will cause flooding and burrow under roadways67 these officials are recommending relocation of the beaver families on july 6 2010 officials of the city of issaquah have asked washington department of fish and wildlife to tear out a beaver dam on tibbetts creek in lake sammamish state park because of concerns about potential flooding and barriers to salmon migration8 in contrast research on watersheds in the northern united states and canada shows that beavers provide ecological benefits by creating ponds that increase fish and bird abundance and diversity9 research in the stillaguamish river basin approximately 50 miles 80 km north of lake sammamish found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89 reduction in coho salmon smolt summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86 reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity10
