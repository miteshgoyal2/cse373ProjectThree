of energy global public support for different energy sources 2011 based on a poll by ipsos global dvisor1 renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale such as sunlight wind rain tides waves and geothermal heat2 renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas electricity generation air and water heatingcooling transportation and rural offgrid energy services3 based on ren21s 2016 report renewables contributed 192 to humans global energy consumption and 237 to their generation of electricity in 2014 and 2015 respectively this energy consumption is divided as 89 coming from traditional biomass 42 as heat energy modern biomass geothermal and solar heat 39 hydro electricity and 22 is electricity from wind solar geothermal and biomass worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than us286 billion in 2015 with countries like china and the united states heavily investing in wind hydro solar and biofuels4 globally there are an estimated 77 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer5 as of 2015 worldwide more than half of all new electricity capacity installed was renewable6 renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas in contrast to other energy sources which are concentrated in a limited number of countries rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security climate change mitigation and economic benefits7 the results of a recent review of the literature8 concluded that as greenhouse gas ghg emitters begin to be held liable for damages resulting from ghg emissions resulting in climate change a high value for liability mitigation would provide powerful incentives for deployment of renewable energy technologies in international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power9 at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond10 some places and at least two countries iceland and norway generate all their electricity using renewable energy already and many other countries have the set a goal to reach 100 renewable energy in the future for example in denmark the government decided to switch the total energy supply electricity mobility and heatingcooling to 100 renewable energy by 205011 while many renewable energy projects are largescale renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries where energy is often crucial in human development12 former united nations secretarygeneral ban kimoon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity13 as most of renewables provide electricity renewable energy deployment is often applied in conjunction with further electrification which has several benefits electricity can be converted to heat where necessary generating higher temperatures than fossil fuels can be converted into mechanical energy with high efficiency and is clean at the point of consumption1415 in addition to that electrification with renewable energy is much more efficient and therefore leads to a significant reduction in primary energy requirements because most renewables dont have a steam cycle with high losses fossil power plants usually have losses of 40 to 6516 renewable energy systems are rapidly becoming more efficient and cheaper their share of total energy consumption is increasing growth in consumption of coal and oil could end by 2020 due to increased uptake of renewables and natural gas1718 contents 1 overview 2 history 3 mainstream technologies 31 wind power 32

circumnavigate the globe in 2012 renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as sunlight wind tides plant growth and geothermal heat as the international energy agency explains19 renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly in its various forms it derives directly from the sun or from heat generated deep within the earth included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar wind ocean hydropower biomass geothermal resources and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for energy efficiency exist over wide geographical areas in contrast to other energy sources which are concentrated in a limited number of countries rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency and technological diversification of energy sources would result in significant energy security and economic benefits7 it would also reduce environmental pollution such as air pollution caused by burning of fossil fuels and improve public health reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that amount to several hundred billion dollars annually only in the united states20 renewable energy sources that derive their energy from the sun either directly or indirectly such as hydro and wind are expected to be capable of supplying humanity energy for almost another 1 billion years at which point the predicted increase in heat from the sun is expected to make the surface of the earth too hot for liquid water to exist2122 climate change and global warming concerns coupled with high oil prices peak oil and increasing government support are driving increasing renewable energy legislation incentives and commercialization9 new government spending regulation and policies helped the industry weather the global financial crisis better than many other sectors23 according to a 2011 projection by the international energy agency solar power generators may produce most of the worlds electricity within 50 years reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment24 as of 2011 small solar pv systems provide electricity to a few million households and microhydro configured into minigrids serves many more over 44 million households use biogas made in householdscale digesters for lighting andor cooking and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of moreefficient biomass cookstoves25 united nations secretarygeneral ban kimoon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity13 at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 of energy supply national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longerterm shares of renewable energy including a 20 target of all electricity generated for the european union by 2020 some countries have much higher longterm policy targets of up to 100 renewables outside europe a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 2020–2030 time frame that range from 10 to 5010 renewable energy often displaces conventional fuels in four areas electricity generation hot waterspace heating transportation and rural offgrid energy services3 power generation by 2040 renewable energy is projected to equal coal and natural gas electricity generation several jurisdictions including denmark germany the state of south australia and some us states have achieved high integration of variable renewables for example in 2015 wind power met 42 of electricity demand in denmark 232 in portugal and 155 in uruguay interconnectors enable countries to balance electricity systems by allowing the import and export of renewable energy innovative hybrid systems have emerged between countries and regions26 heating solar water heating makes an important contribution to renewable heat in many countries most notably in china which now has 70 of the global total 180 gwth most of these systems are installed on multifamily apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in china worldwide total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households the use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well in sweden national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly27 the newest addition to heating is from geothermal heat pumps which provide both heating and cooling and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing national priority2829 see also renewable thermal energy transportation a bus fueled by biodiesel bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as corn sugarcane or sweet sorghum cellulosic biomass derived from nonfood sources such as trees and grasses is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions bioethanol is widely used in the usa and in brazil biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from dieselpowered vehicles biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in europe a solar vehicle is an electric vehicle powered completely or significantly by direct solar energy usually photovoltaic pv cells contained in solar panels convert the suns energy directly into electric energy the term solar vehicle usually implies that solar energy is used to power all or part of a vehicles propulsion solar power may be also used to provide power for communications or controls or other auxiliary functions solar vehicles are not sold as practical daytoday transportation devices at present but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises often sponsored by government agencies however indirectly solarcharged vehicles are widespread and solar boats are available commercially history prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century nearly all energy used was renewable almost without a doubt the oldest known use of renewable energy in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires dates from 790000 years ago use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later sometime between 200000 and 400000 years ago30 probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water this practice can be traced back some 7000 years to ships in the persian gulf31 and on the nile32 moving into the time of recorded history the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human labor animal power water power wind in grain crushing windmills31 and firewood a traditional biomass a graph of energy use in the united states up until 1900 shows oil and natural gas with about the same importance in 1900 as wind and solar played in 2010 in the 1860s and 70s there were already fears that civilization would run out of fossil fuels and the need was felt for a better source in 1873 professor augustin mouchot wrote33 the time will arrive when the industry of europe will cease to find those natural resources so necessary for it petroleum springs and coal mines are not inexhaustible but are rapidly diminishing in many places will man then return to the power of water and wind or will he emigrate where the most powerful source of heat sends its rays to all history will show what will come34 in 1885 werner von siemens commenting on the discovery of the photovoltaic effect in the solid state wrote in conclusion i would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten35 max weber mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his die protestantische ethik und der geist des kapitalismus published in 190536 development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of world war i the importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911 scientific american article in the far distant future natural fuels having been exhausted solar power will remain as the only means of existence of the human race37 the theory of peak oil was published in 195638 in the 1970s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual depletion of oil as well as for an escape from dependence on oil and the first electricity generating wind turbines appeared solar had long been used for heating and cooling but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until 198039 the iea 2014 world energy outlook projects a growth of renewable energy supply from 1700 gigawatts in 2014 to 4550 gigawatts in 2040 fossil fuels received about 550 billion in subsidies in 2013 compared to 120 billion for all renewable energies40 mainstream technologies wind power main article wind power the 845 mw shepherds flat wind farm near arlington oregon usa airflows can be used to run wind turbines modern utilityscale wind turbines range from around 600 kw to 5 mw of rated power although turbines with rated output of 15–3 mw have become the most common for commercial use the largest generator capacity of a single installed onshore wind turbine reached 75 mw in 2015 the power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed so as wind speed increases power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine41 areas where winds are stronger and more constant such as offshore and high altitude sites are preferred locations for wind farms typically full load hours of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites42 windgenerated electricity met nearly 4 of global electricity demand in 2015 with nearly 63 gw of new wind power capacity installed wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in europe the us and canada and the second largest in china in denmark wind energy met more than 40 of its electricity demand while ireland portugal and spain each met nearly 20 globally the longterm technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production or 40 times current electricity demand assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome this would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas particularly in areas of higher wind resources such as offshore as offshore wind speeds average 90 greater than that of land so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land stationed turbines43 in 2014 global wind generation was 706 terawatthours or 3 of the worlds total electricity44 hydropower main articles hydroelectricity and hydropower the three gorges dam on the yangtze river in china in 2015 hydropower generated 166 of the worlds total electricity and 70 of all renewable electricity45 since water is about 800 times denser than air even a slow flowing stream of water or moderate sea swell can yield considerable amounts of energy there are many forms of water energy historically hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs which are still popular in third world countries the largest of which is the three gorges dam2003 in china and the itaipu dam1984 built by brazil and paraguay small hydro systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 50 mw of power they are often used on small rivers or as a low impact development on larger rivers china is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45000 small hydro installations46 runoftheriver hydroelectricity plants derive kinetic energy from rivers without the creation of a large reservoir this style of generation may still produce a large amount of electricity such as the chief joseph dam on the columbia river in the united states hydropower is produced in 150 countries with the asiapacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010 for countries having the largest percentage of electricity from renewables the top 50 are primarily hydroelectric china is the largest hydroelectricity producer with 721 terawatthours of production in 2010 representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use there are now three hydroelectricity stations larger than 10 gw the three gorges dam in china itaipu dam across the brazilparaguay border and guri dam in venezuela47 wave power which captures the energy of ocean surface waves and tidal power converting the energy of tides are two forms of hydropower with future potential however they are not yet widely employed commercially a demonstration project operated by the ocean renewable power company on the coast of maine and connected to the grid harnesses tidal power from the bay of fundy location of worlds highest tidal flow ocean thermal energy conversion which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters has currently no economic feasibility solar energy main article solar energy satellite image of the 550megawatt topaz solar farm in california usa solar energy radiant light and heat from the sun is harnessed using a range of everevolving technologies such as solar heating photovoltaics concentrated solar power csp concentrator photovoltaics cpv solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis4849 solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture convert and distribute solar energy passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the sun selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties and designing spaces that naturally circulate air active solar technologies encompass solar thermal energy using solar collectors for heating and solar power converting sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics pv or indirectly using concentrated solar power csp a photovoltaic system converts light into electrical direct current dc by taking advantage of the photoelectric effect50 solar pv has turned into a multibillion fastgrowing industry continues to improve its costeffectiveness and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with csp5152 concentrated solar power csp systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s cspstirling has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies in 2011 the international energy agency said that the development of affordable inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longerterm benefits it will increase countries energy security through reliance on an indigenous inexhaustible and mostly importindependent resource enhance sustainability reduce pollution lower the costs of mitigating climate change and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise these advantages are global hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared48 italy has the largest proportion of solar electricity in the world in 2015 solar supplied 78 of electricity demand in italy53 in 2016 after another year of rapid growth solar generated 13 of global power54 geothermal energy main articles geothermal energy geothermal electricity and renewable thermal energy steam rising from the nesjavellir geothermal power station in iceland high temperature geothermal energy is from thermal energy generated and stored in the earth thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter earths geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of minerals in currently uncertain55 but possibly roughly equal56 proportions the geothermal gradient which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface the adjective geothermal originates from the greek roots geo meaning earth and thermos meaning heat the heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the earth all the way down to earths core – 4000 miles 6400 km down at the core temperatures may reach over 9000 °f 5000 °c heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt which is commonly known as magma magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock this magma then heats rock and water in the crust sometimes up to 700 °f 371 °c57 from hot springs geothermal energy has been used for bathing since paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient roman times but it is now better known for electricity generation58 low temperature geothermal28 refers to the use of the outer crust of the earth as a thermal battery to facilitate renewable thermal energy for heating and cooling buildings and other refrigeration and industrial uses in this form of geothermal a geothermal heat pump and groundcoupled heat exchanger are used together to move heat energy into the earth for cooling and out of the earth for heating on a varying seasonal basis low temperature geothermal generally referred to as ghp is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling and it also flattens the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements thus low temperature geothermalghp is becoming an increasing national priority with multiple tax credit support59 and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward net zero energy6029 new york city has even just passed a law61 to require ghp anytime is shown to be economical with 20 year financing including the socialized cost of carbon6263 bio energy main articles bioenergy biomass biogas and biofuel sugarcane plantation to produce ethanol in brazil a chp power station using wood to supply 30000 households in france biomass is biological material derived from living or recently living organisms it most often refers to plants or plantderived materials which are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass64 as an energy source biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into thermal chemical and biochemical methods wood remains the largest biomass energy source today65 examples include forest residues – such as dead trees branches and tree stumps – yard clippings wood chips and even municipal solid waste in the second sense biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals including biofuels industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants including miscanthus switchgrass hemp corn poplar willow sorghum sugarcane bamboo66 and a variety of tree species ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm palm oil plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy some examples of these plants are wheat which typically yield 75–8 tonnes of grain per hectare and straw which typically yield 35–5 tonnes per hectare in the uk67 the grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity plant biomass can also be degraded from cellulose to glucose through a series of chemical treatments and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first generation biofuel biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel rotting garbage and agricultural and human waste all release methane gas – also called landfill gas or biogas crops such as corn and sugarcane can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel ethanol biodiesel another transportation fuel can be produced from leftover food products like vegetable oils and animal fats68 also biomass to liquids btls and cellulosic ethanol are still under research6970 there is a great deal of research involving algal fuel or algaederived biomass due to the fact that its a nonfood resource and can be produced at rates 5 to 10 times those of other types of landbased agriculture such as corn and soy once harvested it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol butanol and methane as well as biodiesel and hydrogen the biomass used for electricity generation varies by region forest byproducts such as wood residues are common in the united states agricultural waste is common in mauritius sugar cane residue and southeast asia rice husks animal husbandry residues such as poultry litter are common in the united kingdom71 biofuels include a wide range of fuels which are derived from biomass the term covers solid liquid and gaseous fuels72 liquid biofuels include bioalcohols such as bioethanol and oils such as biodiesel gaseous biofuels include biogas landfill gas and synthetic gas bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermenting the sugar components of plant materials and it is made mostly from sugar and starch crops these include maize sugarcane and more recently sweet sorghum the latter crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions and is being investigated by international crops research institute for the semiarid tropics for its potential to provide fuel along with food and animal feed in arid parts of asia and africa73 with advanced technology being developed cellulosic biomass such as trees and grasses are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions bioethanol is widely used in the united states and in brazil the energy costs for producing bioethanol are almost equal to the energy yields from bioethanol however according to the european environment agency biofuels do not address global warming concerns74 biodiesel is made from vegetable oils animal fats or recycled greases it can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form or more commonly as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from dieselpowered vehicles biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in europe biofuels provided 27 of the worlds transport fuel in 201075 biomass biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heatpower and in doing so harm the environment pollutants such as sulphurous oxides sox nitrous oxides nox and particulate matter pm are produced from the combustion of biomass the world health organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution76 biomass combustion is a major contributor767778 energy storage main articles energy storage and grid energy storage energy storage is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy on an electrical power grid or off it electrical energy is stored during times when production especially from intermittent power plants such as renewable electricity sources such as wind power tidal power solar power exceeds consumption and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption pumpedstorage hydroelectricity is used for more than 90 of all grid power storage market and industry trends main article renewable energy commercialization renewable power has been more effective in creating jobs than coal or oil in the united states79 growth of renewables global growth of renewables through to 201180 comparing worldwide energy use the growth of renewable energy is shown by the green line81 from the end of 2004 worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 annually for many technologies in 2015 global investment in renewables rose 5 to 2859 billion breaking the previous record of 2785 billion in 2011 2015 was also the first year that saw renewables excluding large hydro account for the majority of all new power capacity 134 gw making up 536 of the total of the renewables total wind accounted for 72 gw and solar photovoltaics 56 gw both recordbreaking numbers and sharply up from 2014 figures 49 gw and 45 gw respectively in financial terms solar made up 56 of total new investment and wind accounted for 38 projections vary the eia has predicted that almost two thirds of net additions to power capacity will come from renewables by 2020 due to the combined policy benefits of local pollution decarbonisation and energy diversification some studies have set out roadmaps to power 100 of the world’s energy with wind hydroelectric and solar by the year 2030 according to a 2011 projection by the international energy agency solar power generators may produce most of the worlds electricity within 50 years reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment cedric philibert senior analyst in the renewable energy division at the iea said photovoltaic and solarthermal plants may meet most of the worlds demand for electricity by 2060 – and half of all energy needs – with wind hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity philibert said24 in 2014 global wind power capacity expanded 16 to 369553 mw82 yearly wind energy production is also growing rapidly and has reached around 4 of worldwide electricity usage83 114 in the eu84 and it is widely used in asia and the united states in 2015 worldwide installed photovoltaics capacity increased to 227 gigawatts gw sufficient to supply 1 percent of global electricity demands85 solar thermal energy stations operate in the usa and spain and as of 2016 the largest of these is the 392 mw ivanpah solar electric generating system in california8687 the worlds largest geothermal power installation is the geysers in california with a rated capacity of 750 mw

power in europe9596 renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition a 2011 iea report said a portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming costcompetitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support and added that cost reductions in critical technologies such as wind and solar are set to continue97 hydroelectricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity renewable energy costs continue to drop and the levelised cost of electricity lcoe is declining for wind power solar photovoltaic pv concentrated solar power csp and some biomass technologies98 renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new gridconnected capacity in areas with good resources as the cost of renewable power falls the scope of economically viable applications increases renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity where oilfired generation is the predominant power generation source eg on islands offgrid and in some countries a lowercost renewable solution almost always exists today98 a series of studies by the us national renewable energy laboratory modeled the grid in the western us under a number of different scenarios where intermittent renewables accounted for 33 percent of the total power in the models inefficiencies in cycling the fossil fuel plants to compensate for the variation in solar and wind energy resulted in an additional cost of between 047 and 128 to each megawatt hour generated however the savings in the cost of the fuels saved adds up to 7 billion meaning the added costs are at most two percent of the savings99 hydroelectricity only a quarter of the worlds estimated hydroelectric potential of 14000 twhyear has been developed the regional potentials for the growth of hydropower around the world are 71 europe 75 north america 79 south america 95 africa 95 middle east 82 asia pacific however the political realities of new reservoirs in western countries economic limitations in the third world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas result in the possibility of developing 25 of the remaining potential before 2050 with the bulk of that being in the asia pacific area100 there is slow growth taking place in western counties but not in the conventional dam and reservoir style of the past new projects take the form of runoftheriver and small hydro neither using large reservoirs it is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid101 where circumstances permit existing dams like the russell dam built in 1985 may be updated with pump back facilities for pumpedstorage which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power countries with large hydroelectric developments like canada and norway are spending billions to expand their grids to trade with neighboring countries having limited hydro102 wind power development main article wind power by country worldwide growth of wind capacity 1996–201482 four offshore wind farms are in the thames estuary area kentish flats gunfleet sands thanet and london array the latter is the largest in the world as of april 2013 wind power is widely used in europe china and the united states from 2004 to 2014 worldwide installed capacity of wind power has been growing from 47 gw to 369 gw—a more than sevenfold increase within 10 years with 2014 breaking a new record in global installations 51 gw as of the end of 2014 china the united states and germany combined accounted for half of total global capacity82 several other countries have achieved relatively high levels of wind power penetration such as 21 of stationary electricity production in denmark 18 in portugal 16 in spain and 14 in ireland in 2010 and have since continued to expand their installed capacity103104 more than 80 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis75 offshore wind power as of 2014 offshore wind power amounted to 8771 megawatt of global installed capacity although offshore capacity doubled within three years from 4117 mw in 2011 it accounted for only 23 of the total wind power capacity the united kingdom is the undisputed leader of offshore power with half of the worlds installed capacity ahead of denmark

electricity its a fastgrowing technology doubling its worldwide installed capacity every couple of years pv systems range from small residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations to large utilityscale photovoltaic power station the predominant pv technology is crystalline silicon while thinfilm solar cell technology accounts for about 10 percent of global photovoltaic deployment in recent years pv technology has improved its electricity generating efficiency reduced the installation cost per watt as well as its energy payback time and has reached grid parity in at least 30 different markets by 2014113 financial institutions are predicting a second solar gold rush in the near future114115116 at the end of 2014 worldwide pv capacity reached at least 177000 megawatts photovoltaics grew fastest in china followed by japan and the united states while germany remains the worlds largest overall producer of photovoltaic power contributing about 70 percent to the overall electricity generation italy meets 79 percent of its electricity demands with photovoltaic power—the highest share worldwide117 for 2015 global cumulative capacity is forecasted to increase by more than 50 gigawatts gw by 2018 worldwide capacity is projected to reach as much as 430 gigawatts this corresponds to a tripling within five years118 solar power is forecasted to become the worlds largest source of electricity by 2050 with solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power contributing 16 and 11 respectively this requires an increase of installed pv capacity to 4600 gw of which more than half is expected to be deployed in china and india119 photovoltaic power stations main article list of photovoltaic power stations solar panels at the 550 mw topaz solar farm nellis solar power plant photovoltaic power plant in nevada usa commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s as the cost of solar electricity has fallen the number of gridconnected solar pv systems has grown into the millions and utilityscale solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built solar pv is rapidly becoming an inexpensive lowcarbon technology to harness renewable energy from the sun many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built mainly in europe china and the usa120 the 579 mw solar star in the united states is the worlds largest pv power station many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use tracking systems that follow the suns daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than fixedmounted systems there are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations however when it comes to renewable energy systems and pv it is not just large systems that matter buildingintegrated photovoltaics or onsite pv systems use existing land and structures and generate power close to where it is consumed121 biofuel development see also ethanol fuel sustainable biofuel and issues relating to biofuels brazil produces bioethanol made from sugarcane available throughout the country a typical gas station with dual fuel service is marked a for alcohol ethanol and g for gasoline biofuels provided 3 of the worlds transport fuel in 201075 mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 statesprovinces75 according to the international energy agency biofuels have the potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050122 since the 1970s brazil has had an ethanol fuel program which has allowed the country to become the worlds second largest producer of ethanol after the united states and the worlds largest exporter123 brazils ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap sugarcane as feedstock and the residual canewaste bagasse is used to produce heat and power124 there are no longer light vehicles in brazil running on pure gasoline by the end of 2008 there were 35000 filling stations throughout brazil with at least one ethanol pump125 unfortunately operation car wash has seriously eroded public trust in oil companies and has implicated several high ranking brazilian officials nearly all the gasoline sold in the united states today is mixed with 10 ethanol126 and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends ford daimler ag and gm are among the automobile companies that sell flexiblefuel cars trucks and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85 ethanol by mid2006 there were approximately 6 million ethanol compatible vehicles on us roads127 geothermal development see also geothermal energy in the united states geothermal plant at the geysers california usa geothermal power is cost effective reliable sustainable and environmentally friendly128 but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries recent technological advances have expanded the range and size of viable resources especially for applications such as home heating opening a potential for widespread exploitation geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels as a result geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels the international geothermal association iga has reported that 10715 mw of geothermal power in 24 countries is online which is expected to generate 67246 gwh of electricity in 2010129 this represents a 20 increase in geothermal power online capacity since 2005 iga projects this will grow to 18500 mw by 2015 due to the large number of projects presently under consideration often in areas previously assumed to have little exploitable resource129 in 2010 the united states led the world in geothermal electricity production with 3086 mw of installed capacity from 77 power plants130 the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at the geysers a geothermal field in california131 the philippines follows the us as the second highest producer of geothermal power in the world with 1904 mw of capacity online geothermal power makes up approximately 18 of the countrys electricity generation130 developing countries main article renewable energy in developing countries solar cookers use sunlight as energy source for outdoor cooking renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics and affordable only in the affluent developed world this erroneous view has persisted for many years but 2015 was the first year when investment in nonhydro renewables was higher in developing countries with 156 billion invested mainly in china india and brazil132 renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries in rural and remote areas transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative133 technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power the approximately 13 billion people around the world who dont have access to grid electricity even though they are typically very poor these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene134 as of 2010 an estimated 3 million households get power from small solar pv systems135 kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita more than 30000 very small solar panels each producing 12 to 30 watts are sold in kenya annually some small island developing states sids are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their sustainability136 microhydro configured into minigrids also provide power over 44 million households use biogas made in householdscale digesters for lighting andor cooking and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of moreefficient biomass cookstoves25 clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energypoor areas of the developing world alcohol fuels ethanol and methanol can be produced sustainably from nonfood sugary starchy and cellulostic feedstocks project gaia inc and cleanstar mozambique are implementing clean cooking programs with liquid ethanol stoves in ethiopia kenya nigeria and mozambique137 renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to poverty reduction by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking space heating and lighting renewable energy can also contribute to education by providing electricity to schools138 industry and policy trends see also renewable energy commercialization global new investments in renewable energy139 us president barack obamas american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 includes more than 70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs leading renewable energy companies include first solar gamesa ge energy hanwha q cells sharp solar siemens sunopta suntech power and vestas140 many national state and local governments have also created green banks a green bank is a quasipublic financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies141 green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy the military has also focused on the use of renewable fuels for military vehicles unlike fossil fuels renewable fuels can be produced in any country creating a strategic advantage the us military has already committed itself to have 50 of its energy consumption come from alternative sources142 the international renewable energy agency irena is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide it aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer irena was formed on 26 january 2009 by 75 countries signing the charter of irena143 as of march 2010 irena has 143 member states who all are considered as founding members of which 14 have also ratified the statute144 as of 2011 119 countries have some form of national renewable energy policy target or renewable support policy national targets now exist in at least 98 countries there is also a wide range of policies at stateprovincial and local levels75 united nations secretarygeneral ban kimoon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity13 in october 2011 he announced the creation of a highlevel group to drum up support for energy access energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy the group is to be cochaired by kandeh yumkella the chair of un energy and director general of the un industrial development organisation and charles holliday chairman of bank of america145 100 renewable energy main article 100 renewable energy the incentive to use 100 renewable energy for electricity transport or even total primary energy supply globally has been motivated by global warming and other ecological as well as economic concerns the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated146 at the national level at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 of energy supply also professors s pacala and robert h socolow have developed a series of stabilization wedges that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change and renewable energy sources in aggregate constitute the largest number of their wedges147 using 100 renewable energy was first suggested in a science paper published in 1975 by danish physicist bent sørensen148 it was followed by several other proposals until in 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published these were followed by the first detailed 100 scenarios in 2006 a phd thesis was published by czisch in which it was shown that in a 100 renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in europa and north africa in the same year danish energy professor henrik lund published a first paper149 in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables which was followed by several other papers on the transition to 100 renewable energy in denmark since then lund has been publishing several papers on 100 renewable energy after 2009 publications began to rise steeply covering 100 scenarios for countries in europa america australia and other parts of the world150 in 2011 mark z jacobson professor of civil and environmental engineering at stanford university and mark delucchi published a study on 100 renewable global energy supply in the journal energy policy they found producing all new energy with wind power solar power and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050 barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be primarily social and political not technological or economic they also found that energy costs with a wind solar water system should be similar to todays energy costs151 similarly in the united states the independent national research council has noted that sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change energy security and the escalation of energy costs … renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the united states taken collectively can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand 152 the most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of largescale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological according to the 2013 post carbon pathways report which reviewed many international studies the key roadblocks are climate change denial the fossil fuels lobby political inaction unsustainable energy consumption outdated energy infrastructure and financial constraints153 emerging technologies other renewable energy technologies are still under development and include cellulosic ethanol hotdryrock geothermal power and marine energy154 these technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research development and demonstration rdd funding154 there are numerous organizations within the academic federal and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy this research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields155 multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years two of the most prominent of these labs are sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory nrel both of which are funded by the united states department of energy and supported by various corporate partners156 sandia has a total budget of 24 billion157 while nrel has a budget of 375 million158 enhanced geothermal system enhanced geothermal system see file description for details enhanced geothermal systems egs are a new type of geothermal power technologies that do not require natural convective hydrothermal resources the vast majority of geothermal energy within drilling reach is in dry and nonporous rock159 egs technologies enhance andor create geothermal resources in this hot dry rock hdr through hydraulic stimulation egs and hdr technologies like hydrothermal geothermal are expected to be baseload resources which produce power 24 hours a day like a fossil plant distinct from hydrothermal hdr and egs may be feasible anywhere in the world depending on the economic limits of drill depth good locations are over deep granite covered by a thick 3–5 km layer of insulating sediments which slow heat loss160 there are hdr and egs systems currently being developed and tested in france australia japan germany the us and switzerland the largest egs project in the world is a 25 megawatt demonstration plant currently being developed in the cooper basin australia the cooper basin has the potential to generate 5000–10000 mw cellulosic ethanol several refineries that can process biomass and turn it into ethanol are built by companies such as iogen poet and abengoa while other companies such as the verenium corporation novozymes and dyadic international161 are producing enzymes which could enable future commercialization the shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players from farmers to biotechnology firms and from project developers to investors162 marine energy rance tidal power station france marine energy also sometimes referred to as ocean energy refers to the energy carried by ocean waves tides salinity and ocean temperature differences the movement of water in the worlds oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy or energy in motion this energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes transport and industries the term marine energy encompasses both wave power – power from surface waves and tidal power – obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water reverse electrodialysis red is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose as of 2016 it is being tested at a small scale 50 kw offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy as wind power is derived from the wind even if the wind turbines are placed over water the oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world163 station country location capacity

electricity generation thermoelectric or thermovoltaic devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current floating solar arrays floating solar arrays are pv systems that float on the surface of drinking water reservoirs quarry lakes irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds a small number of such systems exist in france india japan south korea the united kingdom singapore and the united states166167168169170 the systems are said to have advantages over photovoltaics on land the cost of land is more expensive and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation unlike most landbased solar plants floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view they achieve higher efficiencies than pv panels on land because water cools the panels the panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion171 in may 2008 the far niente winery in oakville california pioneered the worlds first floatovoltaic system by installing 994 solar pv modules with a total capacity of 477 kw onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winerys irrigation pond172 utilityscale floating pv farms are starting to be built kyocera will develop the worlds largest a 134 mw farm on the reservoir above yamakura dam in chiba prefecture173 using 50000 solar panels174175 saltwater resistant floating farms are also being constructed for ocean use176 the largest so far announced floatovoltaic project is a 350 mw power station in the amazon region of brazil177 solarassisted heat pump a heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a heat sink heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one a solarassisted heat pump represents the integration of a heat pump and thermal solar panels in a single integrated system typically these two technologies are used separately or only placing them in parallel to produce hot water178 in this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pumps evaporator179 the goal of this system is to get high cop and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way it is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel sheet and tubes rollbond heat pipe thermal plates or hybrid monopolycrystalline thin film in combination with the heat pump the use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows to cover a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduce the power consumption and consequently the variable costs of the system artificial photosynthesis artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol180 researchers in this field are striving to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that utilize a wider region of the solar spectrum employ catalytic systems made from abundant inexpensive materials that are robust readily repaired nontoxic stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds ie carbohydrates rather than building and sustaining living cells181 however prominent research faces hurdles sun catalytix a mit spinoff stopped scaling up their prototype fuelcell in 2012 because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight182 algae fuels producing liquid fuels from oilrich varieties of algae is an ongoing research topic various microalgae grown in open or closed systems are being tried including some system that can be set up in brownfield and desert lands solar aircraft in 2016 solar impulse 2 was the first solarpowered aircraft to complete a circumnavigation of the world an electric aircraft is an aircraft that runs on electric motors rather than internal combustion engines with electricity coming from fuel cells solar cells ultracapacitors power beaming183 or batteries currently flying manned electric aircraft are mostly experimental demonstrators though many small unmanned aerial vehicles are powered by batteries electrically powered model aircraft have been flown since the 1970s with one report in 1957184185 the first mancarrying electrically powered flights were made in 1973186 between 20152016 a manned solarpowered plane solar impulse 2 completed a circumnavigation of the earth187 solar updraft tower the solar updraft tower is a renewableenergy power plant for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouselike roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall chimney tower the resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect this airflow drives wind turbines placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce electricity plans for scaledup versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation and may allow development of other applications such as water extraction or distillation and agriculture or horticulture a more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the vortex engine which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a vortex of air created by a shorter lessexpensive structure spacebased solar power for either photovoltaic or thermal systems one option is to loft them into space particularly geosynchronous orbit to be competitive with earthbased solar power systems the specific mass kgkw times the cost to loft mass plus the cost of the parts needs to be 2400 or less ie for a parts cost plus rectenna of 1100kw the product of the kg and kgkw must be 1300kw or less188 thus for 65 kgkw the transport cost cannot exceed 200kg while that will require a 100 to one reduction spacex is targeting a ten to one reduction reaction engines may make a 100 to one reduction possible debate main articles renewable energy debate nuclear power proposed as renewable energy and green job renewable electricity production from sources such as wind power and solar power is sometimes criticized for being variable or intermittent but is not true for concentrated solar geothermal and biofuels that have continuity in any case the international energy agency has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and through local generation contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks189 there have been not in my back yard nimby concerns relating to the visual and other impacts of some wind farms with local residents sometimes fighting or blocking construction190 in the usa the massachusetts cape wind project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns however residents in other areas have been more positive according to a town councilor the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the ardrossan wind farm in scotland has enhanced the area191 a recent uk government document states that projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities this means giving communities both a say and a stake192 in countries such as germany and denmark many renewable projects are owned by communities particularly through cooperative structures and contribute significantly to overall levels of renewable energy deployment193194 the market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow climate change concerns and increasing in green jobs coupled with high oil prices peak oil oil wars oil spills promotion of electric vehicles and renewable electricity nuclear disasters and increasing government support are driving increasing renewable energy legislation incentives and commercialization9 new government spending regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors23195 while renewables have been very successful in their evergrowing contribution to electrical power there are no countries dominated by fossil fuels who have a plan to stop and get that power from renwables only scotland and ontario have stopped burning coal largely due to good natural gas supplies in the area of transportation fossil fuels are even more entrenched and solutions harder to find196 its unclear if there are failures with policy or renewable energy but twenty years after the kyoto protocol fossil fuels are still our primary energy source and consumption continues to grow197 environmental impact main articles renewable heat incentive scandal operation car wash and biomass § environmental damage the ability of biomass and biofuels to contribute to a reduction in co2 emissions is limited because both biomass and biofuels emit large amounts of air pollution when burned and in some cases compete with food supply furthermore biomass
