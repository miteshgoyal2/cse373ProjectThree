rainier beach neighborhood has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period c 8000 bc – 10000 years ago the xacuabš hahchuahbsh lake people or people of the large lake were related to but distinct from the dkhwduwabsh people of the inside tribe of the lushootseed skagitnisqually coast salish nations both are now c mid1850s of the duwamish tribe the xacuabš village of tleelhchus little island was appropriately on an island at the southwest shore of what is now called lake washington at their trail through a valley that led to the villages of the dkhwduwabsh on salt water at elliott bay and the estuarial duwamish river2 the duwamish were dispossessed with the treaty of point elliott of 1855 the trail became the route for driving livestock to the town of seattle 1870s the valley was renamed rainier valley the island was renamed youngs island 1883 then pritchard island 1900 the trail became the route of the seattle and rainier beach railway 1894 then the seattle renton and southern the route became that of rainier avenue s 1937 the main road to renton and on over snoqualmie pass until the theninnovative floating bridge of 1940 was opened at the nearby mount baker neighborhood early rainier beach business an electric trolley line came to rainier valley in 1891 to columbia city to renton in 1896 residential development began in earnest an early sharp operator beginning in 1896 clarence dayton hillman namesake of the nearby hillman city neighborhood designated rainier beach as the atlantic city residential development 1905 after the new jersey resort he included a park area on the cove built a pier bath house boat house picnic facilities—and sold the land to multiple buyers when he got around to platting the properties snapped up by eager buyers attracted by the adjacent amenities as well as allowing multiple street naming rights the tangled street names were sorted out the property was eventually returned to park purposes c 1912 and the park name has stuck hillman was eventually caught and nominally convicted the interurban railway remained until 1936 when it was torn up to make way for automobiles34 emerson elementary school of historic buildings at least two survive emerson school 1909 lakeridge is an historic landmark sitting on a hill over rainier beach emerson is nearly identical to hawthorne and greenwood schools built at the same time all are brick in jacobean style the first public kindergarten in seattle opened in 1914 at emerson school a notable emerson graduate was professional baseball player and manager fred hutchinson 1919–1964 remembered today with the fred hutchinson cancer research center5 seattle fire department firehouse 33 1914 is a historic landmark built for a single horsedrawn fire engine the modified tudor style was fitted architecturally into the lakeridge neighborhood also known as rainier view the hose tower was built into the ground rather than built above the roof line for the horses 1914–1924 the floor of the single equipment bay was sloped to reduce the starting jolt in responding to a fire alarm6 rainier beach midcentury home rainier beach joined seattle by annexation in 1907 in 1917 the level of the lake was dropped about 9 feet 27 m with us army corps of engineers construction of the lake washington ship canal pritchard island little island tleelhchus became a peninsula the sloughs actually marshes went dry post world war ii the area became urban1 with a sewer outfall near the beaches of atlantic city park and dramatic collapses in water quality in the 1950s the neighborhood benefited greatly with the metro cleanup of lake washington in the 1960s7 the africanamerican population has been slowly increasing in the neighborhood due in large part to the gentrification in other seattle neighborhoods that has forced many blacks to move either into the south end of the city or into the south king county suburbs 1 today rainier beach has a population of 6006 and is roughly 55 african american 20 asian 10 caucasian 10 hispanic and 5 from other races it is now one of only two neighborhoods the other being the southern end of the central district in the city where blacks make up a majority 2 on november 25 2014 the neighborhood became the site of several protests following the decision in ferguson missouri not to indict police officer darren wilson over the killing of michael brown 3 public places and spacesedit rainier beach has beersheva park atlantic city park 1934–1978 and the atlantic city boat ramp kubota garden park lakeridge park fred hutchinson playground and deadhorse canyon natural area too steep for houses in the 19th century lakeridge park preserves 358 acres 142 ha of taylor creek and deadhorse canyon8 urban green spaces and restored natural places can not long survive the intense impact of urban life without due care and community stewardship neighborhood groups of citizen stewards of rainier beach creeks and woods provide public education and volunteer effort together with the city department of neighborhoods and the parks and recreation department taylor creek bridge at kubota garden path in deadhorse canyon mapes creek as it runs through kubota garden mapes creek flows from a ridge in rainier beach through kubota garden historical landmark 1981 and beersheva park formerly atlantic city park 1907–1977 to lake washington the creek was largely spared the assault of urban development by the relative remoteness of its watershed through the frenzied boom development decades 1850–1910 and the efforts of the business of master gardener fujitaro kubota from 1927 interrupted by world war ii japanese american internment until his death in 1973 fortuitous efforts of the kubota family had continued to leave it relatively protected until environmental protection blossomed in the later 20th century the garden is now maintained by the gardeners of the city parks and recreation department and by volunteers largely from surrounding neighborhoods the city purchased approximately 17 acres 69000 m2 of adjacent land to remain as a natural area thus protecting about 215 acres 87 hectares of mapes creek and the headwaters ravine 19879 the nonprofit kubota garden foundation 1990 provides stewardship to enhance and perpetuate the garden within the spirit and vision of its founder in turn promoting understanding of japanese gardening and philosophy in a uniquely syncretic pacific northwest japanese american aesthetic10 taylor creek flows from deadhorse canyon west of rainier avenue s at 68th avenue s and northwest of skyway park through lakeridge park to lake washington with volunteer effort and some city matching grants restoration has been underway since 1971 volunteers have planted thousands of indigenous trees and plants removed tons of garbage removed invasive plants and had city help removing fishblocking culverts and improving trails11 viable daylighted streams can exist only in intimate connection with restoration and stewardship by the neighborhoods of their watersheds in a long run since the good health of an urban stream could not long survive carelessness or neglect1112 with impervious surfaces having replaced most of the natural ground cover in urban environments both the sheer volume and flow rate from unmoderated stormwater and the carrying of nonpoint pollution converge through urban creeks effective solutions include the entire urban watershed far beyond the riparian channel itself1314 a deer has been spotted and sightings of raccoon opossum and birds are common by about 2050 the area will be looking like a young version of what it looked like before being disrupted taylor is one of the four largest streams in urban seattle11 in 2010 the city of seattle began a project to improve fish passage on the creek15 south shore school rainier beach high school schools located in the area include rainier beach high school and south shore school
