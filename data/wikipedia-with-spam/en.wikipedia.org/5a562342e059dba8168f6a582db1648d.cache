it has been suggested that this article be merged into christianity and judaism discuss proposed since may 2017 judeochristian is a term that groups judaism and christianity either in reference to christianitys derivation from judaism or due to perceived parallels or commonalities shared between those two religionscitation needed the term became prevalent towards the middle of the 20th century in the united states to link broader principles of judeochristian ethics such as dignity of human life adherence to the abrahamic covenant common decency and support of traditional family values1 the concept of judeochristian values in an ethical rather than theological or liturgical sense was used by george orwell in 1939 with the phrase the judaeochristian scheme of morals2 it has become part of the american civil religion since the 1940s the term abrahamic religions is used to include baháísm islam druze etc as well as judaism and christianity3 contents 1 history of the term 2 theology and religious law 21 intergroup relations 22 jewish responses 23 role of islam 3 see also 4 references 5 further reading 6 external links history of the termedit the term is used as judæo christian at least as far back as in a letter from alexander mcaul dated october 17 18214 the term in this case referred to jewish converts to christianity5 the term is used similarly by joseph wolff in 1829 referring to a style of church that would keep with some jewish traditions in order to convert jews6 use of the german term judenchristlich jewishchristian in a decidedly negative sense can be found in the late writings of friedrich nietzsche who emphasized what he saw as neglected aspects of continuity between the jewish world view and that of christianity the expression appears in the antichrist published in 1895 and written several years earlier a fuller development of nietzsches argument can be found in a prior work on the genealogy of morality theology and religious lawedit further information biblical law in christianity and new covenant christianity inherits the notion of a covenant from second temple judaism in the form of the old testament two major views of the relationship exist namely new covenant theology and dualcovenant theology in addition although the order of the books in the protestant old testament excluding the biblical apocrypha and the tanakh hebrew bible differ the contents of the books are very similar7 the christian old testament is thus jewish scripture and it is used as moral and spiritual teaching material throughout the christian world the prophets patriarchs and heroes of the jewish scripture are also known in christianity which uses the jewish text as the basis for its understanding of biblical figures such as abraham elijah and moses as a result a substantial amount of jewish and christian teachings are based on a common sacred text intergroup relationsedit further information antisemitism in the united states promoting the concept of united states as a judeochristian nation based upon judeochristian ethics first became a political program in the 1940s in response to the growth of antisemitism in america jews played a small role in that but the rise of antisemitism in the 1930s led concerned protestants catholics and jews to take steps to increase mutual understanding and lessen the high levels of antisemitism in the united states8 in this effort precursors of the national conference of christians and jews created teams consisting of a priest a rabbi and a minister to run programs across the country and fashion a more pluralistic america no longer defined as a christian land but one nurtured by three ennobling traditions protestantism catholicism and judaismthe phrase judeochristian entered the contemporary lexicon as the standard liberal term for the idea that western values rest on a religious consensus that included jews9 through soulsearching in the aftermath of the holocaust there was a revolution in christian theology in america … the greatest shift in christian attitudes toward the jewish people since constantine converted the roman empire10 the rise of christian zionism—that is religiously motivated christian interest and support for the state of israel—along with a growth of philosemitism love of the jewish people has increased interest among american evangelicals in judaism especially areas of commonality with their own beliefs see also jerusalem in christianity during the late 1940s evangelical proponents of the new judeochristian approach lobbied washington for diplomatic support of the new state of israel the evangelicals have never wavered in their support for israel on the other hand by the late 1960s mainline protestant denominations and the national council of churches were showing more support for the palestinians than for the israelis11 interest in and a positive attitude towards americas judeochristian tradition has become mainstream among evangelicals12 the scriptural basis for this new positive attitude towards jews among evangelicals is genesis 123 in which god promises that he will bless those who bless abraham and his descendants and curse those who curse them see also abrahamic covenant other factors in the new philosemitism include gratitude to the jews for contributing to the theological foundations of christianity and for being the source of the prophets and jesus remorse for the churchs history of antisemitism and fear that god will judge the nations at the end of time on the basis of how they treated the jewish people moreover for many evangelicals israel is seen as the instrument through which prophecies of the end times are fulfilled13 great numbers of christian pilgrims visit israel especially in times of trouble for the jewish state to offer moral support and return with an even greater sense of a shared judeochristian heritagecitation needed jewish responsesedit response of jews towards the judeochristian concept has been mixed in the 1930s in the face of worldwide antisemitic efforts to stigmatize and destroy judaism influential christians and jews in america labored to uphold it pushing judaism from the margins of american religious life towards its very center14 during world war ii jewish chaplains worked with catholic priests and protestant ministers to promote goodwill addressing servicemen who in many cases had never seen much less heard a rabbi speak before at funerals for the unknown soldier rabbis stood alongside the other chaplains and recited prayers in hebrew in a much publicized wartime tragedy the sinking of the dorchester the ships multifaith chaplains gave up their lifebelts to evacuating seamen and stood together arm in arm in prayer as the ship went down a 1948 postage stamp commemorated their heroism with the words interfaith in action9 in the 1950s a spiritual and cultural revival washed over american jewry in response to the trauma of the holocaust9 american jews became more confident to be identified as different two notable books addressed the relations between contemporary judaism and christianity abba hillel silvers where judaism differs and leo baecks judaism and christianity both motivated by an impulse to clarify judaisms distinctiveness in a world where the term judeochristian had obscured critical differences between the two faiths15 reacting against the blurring of theological distinctions rabbi eliezer berkovits wrote that judaism is judaism because it rejects christianity and christianity is christianity because it rejects judaism16 theologian and author arthur a cohen in the myth of the judeochristian tradition questioned the theological validity of the judeochristian concept and suggested that it was essentially an invention of american politics while jacob neusner in jews and christians the myth of a common tradition writes the two faiths stand for different people talking about different things to different people17 law professor stephen m feldman looking at the period before 1950 chiefly in europe sees religious conflict as supersessionism once one recognizes that christianity has historically engendered antisemitism then this socalled tradition appears as dangerous christian dogma at least from a jewish perspective for christians the concept of a judeochristian tradition comfortably suggests that judaism progresses into christianity—that judaism is somehow completed in christianity the concept of a judeochristian tradition flows from the christian theology of supersession whereby the christian covenant or testament with god supersedes the jewish one christianity according to this myth reforms and replaces judaism the myth therefore implies first that judaism needs reformation and replacement and second that modern judaism remains merely as a relic most importantly the myth of the judeochristian tradition insidiously obscures the real and significant differences between judaism and christianity18 role of islamedit further information abrahamic religions advocates of the term abrahamic religion since the second half of the 20th century have proposed a hyperecumenicism that emphasizes not only judeochristian commonalities but that would include islam as well the rationale for the term abrahamic being that while only christianity and judaism give the hebrew bible old testament the status of scripture islam does also trace its origins to the figure of abraham as the first muslim advocates of this umbrella term consider it the exploration of something positive in the sense of a spiritual bond between jews christians and muslims19 see alsoedit abrahamites british israelism israel–united states relations judeochristianislamic
