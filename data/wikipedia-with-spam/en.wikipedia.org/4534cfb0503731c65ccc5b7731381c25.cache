external links historyedit offices of the gazette in the dominion square building on saint catherine street in montreal fleury mesplet founded a frenchlanguage weekly newspaper called la gazette du commerce et littéraire pour la ville et district de montréal on june 3 17785 it was the first entirely frenchlanguage newspaper in canada5 the paper did not accept advertising aside for the various books mesplet also published the articles were meant to promote discussion and focused on literature and philosophy as well as various anecdotal articles poems and letters5 this paper was considered an organ for proamerican revolutionary propaganda mesplet an immigrant from france had previously lived in philadelphia and sided with the americans when they occupied montreal during the american revolutionary war the newspaper was shut down in 1779 when mesplet and the editor valentin jautard were arrested for sedition and imprisoned for three years mesplet began a second weekly the montreal gazette la gazette de montréal on august 25 1785 which had a dual frenchenglish bilingual format similar to that used by the quebec gazette5 its offices were located in the house of joseph lemoyne de longueuil on rue de la capitale6 french columns were in the lefthand column and english columns in the righthand column the columns were originally written in french and translated to english by valentin jautard who served as editor until his death in 17875 the columns were mostly on education religion and literature and after 1788 on politics5 foreign and local news made up the rest of the paper the paper took a voltairian and anticlerical stance wanted quebec to have its own legislative assembly and sought to import the principles of the french revolution to quebec5 the newspaper also introduced advertising and announcements taking up half of four pages it is the direct ancestor of the current newspaper the newspaper did well and mesplets operation moved to notredame street in 1787 mesplet continued to operate the newspaper until his death in 17945 following mesplets death his widow published the newspaper for several issues but the paper ceased publication soon after two rivals louis roy and edward edwards fought over the right to publish the newspaper over the course of two years6 edwards eventually won the printing press and newspaper and continued operations until his assets were seized in 18086 the newspaper was then the property of james brown for fourteen years in 1822 it was sold to businessman thomas andrew turner who converted into an englishonly paper in 182236 under turner the gazette identified with the interests of anglophone business leaders in their fight with the patriote movement6 on april 25 1849 the gazette published a special edition in which its editorinchief james moir ferres called the anglosaxon residents to arms after royal assent of a compensation law for lower canada7 this was among the main events leading to the burning of the parliament buildings ferres was subsequently arrested in 1968 the gazette was acquired by the southam newspaper chain which owned major dailies across canada3 for many years the gazette was caught in a threeway fight for the english newspaper audience in montreal with the tabloid montreal herald and the broadsheet montreal star8 the gazette was second in circulation to the montreal star which sold more newspapers in the city and had a significant national reputation in the first half of the 20th century the montreal herald closed in 1957 after publishing for 146 years the montreal star part of the fp publications chain which owned the winnipeg free press and at the time the globe and mail endured a long strike and ceased publication in 1979 less than a year after the strike was settled a statue in westmount of man reading the gazette in 1988 a competing englishlanguage daily the montreal daily news was launched the montreal daily news adopted a tabloid format and introduced a sunday edition forcing the gazette to respond after the montreal daily news folded in 1989 after less than two years in operation the gazette kept its sunday edition going until august 2010 in 1996 the southam papers were bought by conrad blacks hollinger inc then in august 2000 hollinger sold the southam newspapers including the gazette to canwest global communications corp controlled by the winnipegbased asper family in 2010 a new media group postmedia bought the gazette and other papers from the financially troubled canwest8 to celebrate its 150th anniversary the gazette published a facsimile of one of its earliest issues much effort was made to use a type of paper that imitated 18th century paper with fake chainlines and laidlines to make the paper look old9 todayedit today the gazettes audience is primarily quebecs englishspeaking community the gazette is one of the four dailies published in montreal the other three being frenchlanguage newspapers la presse le journal de montréal and le devoir in recent years the gazette has stepped up efforts to reach bilingual francophone professionals and adjusted its coverage accordingly the current editor in chief is lucinda chodan and the associate managing editors are james bassil and jeff blond1 final version of the papers logotype under the title the gazette on april 30 2013 postmedia network announced that it would be eliminating the role of publisher at each of its newspapers including the gazette instead the companys 10 newspapers will be overseen by regional publishersone each for the pacific the prairies and eastern canada alan allnutt who was the publisher of the gazette at the time became the regional publisher of postmedias alberta and saskatchewan papers gerry nott publisher of the ottawa citizen now also oversees the gazette the windsor star and postmedias flagship title the national post10 on may 5 2014 it was announced that printing of the gazette would be contracted out to transcontinental media in august 2014 and that the existing notredamedegrâce facility would be closed resulting in a loss of 54 fulltime and 61 parttime positions at the paper the august 16 2014 issue was the final issue printed by the postmediaowned facility1112 on october 21 2014 the gazette was relaunched as part of the postmedia reimagined project adopting a similar look and similar suite of digital platforms to its sister paper the ottawa citizen which had relaunched earlier in the year as part of the relaunch the paper was officially renamed the montreal gazette reflecting its longstanding common name outside its city of publication as well as its web domain montrealgazettecom the paper had not included montreal in its masthead in several years13 the new typeface and style introduced with the rename has been criticized as being subpar14 sectionsedit weekdays section a — local national and international news opinion columns editorials editorial cartoon letters to the editor
