way viaduct replacement tunnel is a bored road tunnel that is under construction in the city of seattle in the us state of washington the 2mile 32 km tunnel will carry state route 99 under downtown seattle from the sodo neighborhood to south lake union in the north since 2001 the replacement of the alaskan way viaduct has been the source of much political consternation demonstrating the seattle process options for replacing the viaduct which carries 110000 vehicles per day included either replacing it with a cutandcover tunnel replacing it with another elevated highway or eliminating it while modifying other surface streets and public transportation the current plan emerged in 2009 when government officials agreed to a deepbore tunnel boring of the tunnel with the worlds largestdiameter tunnelboring machine tbm bertha began on july 30 201334 the project which was originally scheduled for completion in december 20155 was halted on december 6 2013 after an unknown stoppage approximately 1083 feet 330 m into the planned 9270footlong 2830 m route investigations a month later revealed that the machine had damaged several of its cutting blades after encountering a steel pipe that was used to measure groundwater in 2002 around the alaskan way viaduct6 over the next two years a recovery pit was dug from the surface in order to access and lift the machines cutterhead for repair and partial replacement bertha resumed tunnel boring on december 22 20157 as of july 2016update wsdot estimated that the tunnel would be completed and open to traffic in early

external links planning historyedit alaskan way viaduct issuesedit the alaskan way viaduct main article alaskan way viaduct the alaskan way viaduct completed on april 4 1953 is a doubledecked elevated section of state route 99 sr 99 that runs along the elliott bay waterfront in the industrial district and downtown of seattle it is the smaller of the two major north–south traffic corridors through seattle the other being interstate 5 carrying up to 110000 vehicles per day12 the viaduct runs above the surface street alaskan way from s nevada street in the south to the entrance of belltowns battery street tunnel in the north following previously existing railroad lines the 1989 loma prieta earthquake destroyed the similarly designed cypress street viaduct in oakland california with the loss of 42 lives13 the 2001 nisqually earthquake damaged the viaduct and its supporting alaskan way seawall and required the washington state department of transportation wsdot to invest us145 million in emergency repairs experts gave a 1in20 chance that the viaduct could be shut down by an earthquake within the following decade14 after the nisqually earthquake the viaduct has been closed semiannually for wsdot to conduct inspections of the structure those inspections have discovered continuing settlement damage in 2005 a group of researchers and faculty from the university of washington urged political officials to close the viaduct within a twoyear timeframe15 the alaskan way viaduct seen from elliott bay the view beneath the viaduct opponents of a new viaduct argued that the enlarged replacement would put more of the waterfront in shadow16 options and politicsedit several replacement proposals were developed many seattle leaders including thenmayor greg nickels and state and city transportation officials favored building a tunnel plans for a sixlane cutandcover doubledecker tunnel were developed17 the tunnel was envisioned to solve not only the viaducts traffic limitations and safety problems but also to allow better uses for the waterfront real estate including parks housing and retail developments while future development of the alaskan way real estate corridor may provide tax revenue for the city many state lawmakers objected to the cost of the proposed sixlane tunnelcitation needed one criticism compared the plan to bostons big dig project which was said to illustrate the schedule and budget challenges of a large cutandcover tunnel proponents responded that the seattle proposal was significantly smaller in scale than the big dig18 another proposal aimed to replace the current viaduct with another elevated structure with updated seismic standards this new viaduct would be larger 12foot 37 m wide lanes with new shoulders on both sides compared to the structure it would replace which had no shoulders and lanes as narrow as 10 feet 30 m in places the on and off ramps at the northern and southern portion of the viaduct would remain the same with an additional full intersection at south atlantic street and south royal brougham way the first street off ramp would be removed the plan included a complete replacement of the sea wall it was estimated to cost 28 billion and take 10–12 years to construct19 many prominent leaders and organizations opposed the elevated structure and believed this was a unique opportunity to remove the viaduct and connect downtown seattle to the waterfront former governors dan evans and gary locke former us senator slade gorton and the american institute of architects20 recommended against rebuilding the viaductcitation needed wsdot evaluated five proposals in 2003–2004 and decided that the sixlane cutandcover tunnel was the preferred alternative rebuilding the viaduct was retained as a backup plan21 however due to the costs and scope of the project other options were still being discussed in the local media a proposal to remove the viaduct and replace it with surface street and transit improvements was backed by former king county executive ron sims22 the peoples waterfront coalition23 and the congress for the new urbanism23 proponents of this plan offered examples of successes in removing highways in other cities they envisioned the waterfront becoming a pedestrianfriendly neighborhood with a mix of commercial retail and public park spaces traffic needs would be addressed through modifications to existing streets i5 and public transit they argued that these modifications would be desirable in any event proponents further argued that this plan had the potential to improve the tourist economy create jobs and encourage a denser and more residential downtown through the offering of a generous waterfront park24 the total cost of removal of the viaduct repairing the seawall and improvements to i5 and existing streets was unofficially estimated to be 16 billioncitation needed in 2006 seattle city council member peter steinbrueck noted while the mayors first choice is the tunnel he supports the city councils resolution that designates a surface and transit alternative as a backup25 in response to concerns about the cost of the originally proposed tunnel construction the city council created a scaleddown fourlane hybrid tunnel option this would have combined the smaller tunnel with surface transit improvements to address traffic needs the tunnels 14foot 43 m shoulders would be used as an extra travel lane each way during periods of high demand transit service would be increased during peak commuter periods cars entering and exiting from elliott and western avenues would each have a dedicated lane third avenue would become a permanent transit corridor the cost estimate for the fourlane tunnel was 34 billioncitation needed on february 13 2007 governor christine gregoire rejected the tunnel hybrid option saying that a wsdot review showed the tunnel proposal does not meet state and federal safety standards of particular concern was that the use of shoulders as traffic lanes during peak traffic times would leave no additional lanes for emergency access26 however several of the viaduct stakeholders committee brought on board to advise the city indicated that the tunnel option should remain on the table27 state and city officials deadlocked in late 2006 over whether to build an elevated structure the states preference or a hybrid tunnel the citys preference governor gregoire stated no action was not an option for the viaduct28 the state government called for an advisory ballot on march 13 2007 for seattle residents which was supported by the city council the advisory ballot allowed seattleites to vote on whether they supported a surfacetunnel hybrid and whether they supported an elevated structure29 voters rejected both options with the surfacetunnel hybrid getting only 30 support and the elevated structure only 4330 in 2011 seattleites were asked to vote on the deep bore tunnel option and approved it with 60 in favor 31 bored tunnel selectionedit milepost 31 the sr 99–alaskan way viaduct replacement tunnel information center in pioneer square front of a model of the tunnel

gregoire announced that the state of washington would take down the viaduct in 201232 on january 12 2009 the state of washington king county the city of seattle and the port of seattle revealed that they had agreed to replace the viaduct with a bored underground tunnel33 on march 4 2009 the state senate passed a bill endorsing the tunnel option34 on may 12 2009 governor gregoire signed senate bill 5768 authorizing 28 billion in state funds for a possible deepbore tunnel controversy surrounds the tunnel project however as it was never approved in any general election or referendum is the subject of multiple lawsuits was selected before legally required environmental impact studies on both the state and federal level were completed and is designed in legislation to make seattlearea taxpayers pay for any cost overruns35full citation neededbetter source needed which is not the norm for statelevel projects which generally have their costs distributed evenly among all state residents disparate factions ranging from some environmentalists to some industrialists criticized the tunnel decision3336 a business owner argued that the restrictions on hazardous cargo through the tunnel would restrict movement of freight through downtown36 though hazardous cargo is already prohibited from the battery street tunnel and the viaduct at peak hours37 similarly another argued that surface traffic would increase which would cause further problems to downtown freight transport33 a chairman of a local sierra club chapter argued that the large investment in automobile transport did not take into account global warming concerns33 design construction and fundingedit freighter fairpartner carrying the disassembled tunnel boring machine into the port of seattle the approved design is a fourlane 2mile 32 km long bored underground tunnel33 the tunnel will have a south portal in sodo near centurylink field and a north portal in south lake union east of seattle center36 the route goes beneath pioneer square the central business district of downtown and belltown the project is estimated to cost us425 billion with 28 billion coming from the state and federal governments to cover the tunnel boring and a new interchange in sodo36 the replacement project also includes the following projects and funding sources the city of seattle will fund surface street improvements utility relocation and repairs to the alaskan way seawall which was also damaged in the 2001 nisqually earthquake36 since the proposed tunnel will contain two lanes in each direction as opposed to the viaducts three and no western avenue exit to serve the belltown interbay magnolia and ballard areas king county will fund transit improvements to offset the loss36 the port of seattle is considering funding part of the project in sodo36 200 million will be collected from tolls38 at rates set by the washington state transportation commission39 with input from the advisory committee on tolling and traffic management40 wsdot began part of the larger project in 2008 while the replacement debate was still ongoing by repairing some of the viaduct columns41 the 80 million tunnel boring machine tbm bertha was created for this project by hitachi zosen corporation near osaka japan the 326 ft 99 m 6700shortton 6100 t tbm was disassembled into 40 pieces and shipped to seattle where it was reassembled in the launch pit near the south end of the future tunnel42 from there the recordbreaking 575foot 175 m diameter borer moves in 65 ft 20 m increments toward the north end4344 wsdot nicknamed the tbm bertha after seattles first female mayor bertha knight landes this name was chosen from names submitted by kindergarten through 12th grade students for a naming competition45 the initial phase of demolition and removal of the viaduct began on october 21 2011 only a southern portion of the viaduct was removed at that time the viaduct along the central waterfront will remain open for traffic until the tunnel is complete4647 boring began on july 30 2013 and at the time was expected to be completed in 14 months1 after three weeks of drilling the project was estimated to be two weeks behind schedule problems with fiberglass near the front of the drill and a labor dispute with a local longshoremans union were blamed48 boring was again delayed in december when bertha struck a steel pipe installed as a well casing for an exploratory well drilled as part of the planning phases of the project49 this delay lasted for more than two years as the workers had to dig a 120foot 37 m vertical shaft down to berthas cutting head to repair it settling was discovered in pioneer square that may be related to this additional excavation50 wsdot plans to fill in the battery street tunnel after the replacement tunnel is open to traffic because the 1952 cutandcover tunnel does not meet modern safety standards is expensive to maintain and will be made redundant by the alaskan way tunnel51 dirt produced by tunnel construction will be sent to fill a calportland quarry in nearby port ludlow washington52 tunnel boring had resumed on december 22 20159 the tunnel boring was halted 23 days later on january 14 2016 after a 30footwide 91 m sinkhole developed on the ground in front of the machine causing governor jay inslee to halt drilling until the contractors can perform a root cause analysis to show that the machine can be run safely53 even though contractors filled the hole with 250 cubic yards 190 m3 of material the ground above the tunnelboring machine is continuing to sink according to the washington state department of transportation the tunneling restriction was lifted on february 23 2016 and tunneling resumed that day10 bertha passed under the alaskan way viaduct in early may closing the roadway for 11 days as the machine had 15 feet 46 m of vertical clearance under the structures pilings54 as of april 4 2017update the tunnel boring machine broke through to the recovery pit on the north end of the tunnel completing the excavation process and will be removed from the site as the next step taking four to five months11 as of july 2016update seattle tunnel partners expects to have the tunnel completed and open to traffic in early 2019 an estimated 223 million in cost overruns were reported as a result of the twoyear stoppage855 see
