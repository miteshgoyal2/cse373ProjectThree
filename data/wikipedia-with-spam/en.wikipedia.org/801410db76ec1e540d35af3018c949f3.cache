references 7 external links historyedit foundingedit sonyatv was founded as a subsidiary of the uks associated television atv atv operated a commercial television company broadcasting from 1955 in london until 1968 and the english midlands until 1982 as part of the independent television itv network business tycoon louis benjamin was involved with lew grade as part of one of the four major record companies in the uk at the time the company was pye records which along with emi philips and decca records uk accounted for the vast majority of music records sold in the uk9 in 1959 atv acquired 50 of pye records10 between them grade and benjamin held most of the shares9 atv music publishing was created to exploit the catalogue of songs written by artists on the pye record label and for the themes to itc and atv television programmes the uk rights to some of the rock n roll music from the us were also bought by atv9 grade established atvs headquarters alongside those of pye records off edgware road beside the marble arch in central london11 early historyedit john lennon and paul mccartney failed to purchase atv music publishing in the late 1960s the 1950s and 1960s was a good period for grade and his brothers bernard delfont and leslie grade and their companies pye records had major artists of the period under contract the searchers the kinks donovan mungo jerry and petula clark were some of the artists that recorded for pye records pye also had contracts with several us companies allowing them to manufacture and distribute records in the uk chess records was among those and counted chuck berry as one of its top artists11 atv music acquired the rights to the lennon–mccartney song catalogue northern songs in 196912 the catalog featured almost every song written by lennon–mccartney northern songs was coowned by lennon mccartney brian epstein and dick james who owned a controlling interest in 1969 james offered to sell his shares to atv lennon and mccartney then attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company12 their bid to gain control part of a long and acrimonious fight failed the financial clout of grade their adversary in the bidding war ensured that the songs written by the two beatles passed into the control of atv12 atv music publishing remained a successful organization in the music industry throughout the 1970s len beadle the companys chief executive signed up many songwriters and bought numerous song catalogues the catalog acquisitions along with the continuing royalties from lennon and mccartney ensured that large amounts of money were frequently coming in for atv music publishing despite the success of the music publishing organization other ventures formed by grade were not performing as well pye records which continued to distribute music from artists such as carl douglas and barry white was failing to bring in large amounts of money13 the main television arm of atv lost its governmentgranted license in its thencurrent form and was restructured into central independent television acquisitionedit michael jackson acquired atv music publishing in 1985 and merged it with sony a decade later by the mid1980s atv music publishing and pye records were both up for sale the companies were bought relatively cheaply by australian businessman robert holmes à court who acquired associated communications corporation the parent company in 198214 assetstripped the subsidiaries and sacked many long serving employees before selling the companies on again151617 during this time american singer michael jackson was recording say say say for paul mccartneys pipes of peace album jackson stayed at the home of mccartney and his wife linda during the recording sessions becoming friendly with both one evening whilst at the dining table mccartney brought out a thick bound notebook displaying all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights jackson grew more excited as he examined the pages he inquired about how to buy songs and what the songs were used for4 mccartney explained that music publishing was a way to make big money jackson replied by telling mccartney that he would buy the beatles songs one day mccartney laughed saying great good joke18 jackson was first informed that the atv catalog was up for sale in september 1984 by his attorney john branca who had put together jacksons earlier catalogue acquisitions warned of the competition he would face in buying such popular songs jackson remained resolute in his decision to purchase them24 branca approached mccartneys attorney to query whether the beatle was planning to bid the attorney stated he wasnt it was too pricey23 according to bert reuter who negotiated the sale of atv music for holmes à court we had given paul mccartney first right of refusal but paul didnt want it at that time19 lennons widow yoko ono had been contacted as well but also did not enter bidding3 mccartney and ono had attempted to purchase the catalogue in 19812 they were offered the catalogue for £20 million 40 million usd and proposed the pair would each pay £10 million320 ono refused as she thought it was too high a price mccartney spoke about the offer at a press conference in april 1990 explaining that ono actually said i think we can get it for 5 so i said well ok you know lets see what we can do and we couldnt20 the competitors in the 1984 sale of atv music included charles koppelman and marty bandiers new yorkbased the entertainment co virgin records new york real estate tycoon samuel j lefrak and financier charles knapp on november 20 1984 jackson sent a bid of 46 million to holmes à court branca suggested the amount of the bid after having spent time evaluating the earnings of the catalogue and learning of another bid for 39 million jackson was only interested in the music copyrights but the package also included buildings a recording studio and studio equipment the two sides signed a nonbinding memorandum of mutual interest in december 1984 and jacksons team began a fourmonth process of verifying atv musics legal documents financial reports and every significant composition in the nearly 4000song catalog4 the two sides began drafting contracts in january 1985 and followthrough meetings began on march 16 jacksons team described the negotiations as frustrating with frequent shifts of position by the other side one holmes à court representative described the negotiations as a game of poker jacksons team thought they had reached a deal several times but new bidders would enter the picture or they would encounter new areas of debate the prospective deal went through eight drafts in may 1985 jacksons team walked away from negotiations after having spent hundreds of hours and over 1 million in june 1985 they learned koppelmanbandier had made a tentative agreement with holmes à court to buy the catalog for 50 million4 but in early august holmes à court contacted jackson and talks resumed jackson only raised his bid to 475 million but he had the advantage of being able to close the deal faster having completed due diligence of atv music prior to any formal agreement4 he also agreed to visit australia as a guest of holmes à court and appear on the channel seven perth telethon419 holmes à court included some more assets and agreed to establish a scholarship in jacksons name at a us university4 branca closed the deal and purchased atv music on jacksons behalf for 475 million on august 10 198524 in october 1985 jackson fulfilled his contract provision to visit perth western australia and appear on the telethon where he spoke briefly and met with two children419 in an analysis of the acquisition the los angeles times noted that if yesterday were to earn 100000 a year in royalties the lennon estate and mccartney would divide 50 of the income 25000 each the publisher jackson would receive the other 50 50000 it was mentioned that yesterday probably earns more than 100000 a year the publisher would also control the use of the song in films commercials and stage productions24 jackson went on to use the beatles songs in numerous commercials feeling that it would enable a new generation of fans to enjoy the music mccartney who had himself used the buddy holly song catalogue in commercials felt saddened2 privately jackson was reported to have expressed exasperation at mccartneys attitude he felt that the musician should have paid for the songs he had written2 at the time mccartney was one of the richest entertainers in the world with a net worth of 560 million and a royalty income of 41 million2 jackson stated if he didnt want to invest 475 million in his own songs then he shouldnt come crying to me now2 appearing on the late show with david letterman shortly after jackson died in 2009 mccartney spoke about jacksons acquisition of the beatles songs and the impact of it on their relationship21 and which was you know that was cool somebody had to get it i suppose what happened actually was then i started to ring him up i thought ok heres the guy historically placed to give lennon–mccartney a good deal at last cuz we got signed when we were 21 or something in a back alley in liverpool and the deal its remained the same even though we made this company the most famous… hugely successful so i kept thinking it was time for a raise well you would you know david letterman yes i think so and so it was great but i did talk to him about it but he kind of blanked me on it he kept saying thats just business paul you know so yeah it is and waited for a reply but we never kind of got to it and i thought mm so we kind of drifted apart it was no big bust up we kind of drifted apart after that but he was a lovely man massively talented and we miss him ono was pleased that jackson had acquired northern songs and called it a blessing2 speaking in november 1990 ono stated businessmen who arent artists themselves wouldnt have the consideration michael has he loves the songs hes very caring2 she added that if she and mccartney were to own the songs there would certainly be arguments ono explained that neither she nor mccartney needed that if paul got the songs people would have said paul finally got john and if i got them theyd say oh the dragon lady strikes again2 merger with sonyedit the merging of atv with sony establishes our commitment to create one of the largest music publishing ventures in the world we have been working on this for over a year and now with the two of us together the sky is our only limit michael jackson 199522 after jacksons acquisition of atv music publishing his record labels owner cbs was negotiating the sale of its record division in an unrelated deal the record company was renamed sony music entertainment in 1991 following hurriedly arranged meetings and disagreements over the selling price a deal was sealed by jackson during a concert in tokyo23 upon seeing the success of this sale japanese corporation sony sought to break away from its core business of hardware manufacturing and diversify into music films and games looking for further opportunities the company aimed to expand its music publishing interests the japanese corporation since it wanted to diversify in the media offered jackson 90 million for a 50 stake in the atv catalogue via a merger with sony music through the agreement jackson would become one of the most important shareholders in sony2324 jackson gladly accepted he had essentially acquired half ownership of the beatles songs for a large profit23 jacksons own songs were not included in the deal22 sony and atv having merged the new company was named sonyatv music publishing and became the second largest music publisher in the world23 michael p schulhof president and ceo of sony corporation of america welcomed the merger and praised jackson for his efforts in the venture michael jackson is not only the most successful entertainer in history he is also an astute businessman michael understands the importance of copyrights and the role they play in the introduction to new technologies22 he added that jackson recognises sonys leadership in developing and realizing new technologies that serve to expand the creative horizon of artists such as himself22 administrative expertise was provided by sony who installed paul russell as chairman jackson was a company director and attended board meetings regularly23 as each party in the arrangement held the power of veto both sides would have to agree on a decision before it could be made if neither party agreed on a decisions they would not be implemented23 in may 2001 jackson denied rumours that he was planning to sell the beatles song catalogue rumours had circulated that the singer was to sell them in order to finance the upkeep of neverland ranch and to cover legal bill expenses25 the singer announced in a statement i want to clarify a silly rumour – the beatles catalogue is not for sale has not been for sale and will never be for sale25 sonyatv music publishing continued to acquire song catalogues in the 21st century in november
