logo with the sponsors name and contribution in inlaid brass block lettering1011 special stars and friends monuments are granted by the hollywood chamber of commerce or the hollywood historic trust but are not part of the walk of fame proper and are located nearby on private property1012 the monuments for the apollo 11 mission to the moon are uniquely shaped four identical circular moons bearing

historyedit originedit the walk of fame at the 6800 block of hollywood boulevard looking eastward the dolby theatre is in the foreground at left in the upper left quadrant is the famous intersection of hollywood and highland the hollywood chamber of commerce credits em stuart its volunteer president in 1953 with the original idea for creating a walk of fame stuart reportedly proposed the walk as a means to maintain the glory of a community whose name means glamour and excitement in the four corners of the world14 harry sugarman another chamber member and president of the hollywood improvement association receives credit in an independent account15 a committee was formed to flesh out the idea and an architectural firm was retained to develop specific proposals by 1955 the basic concept and general design had been agreed upon and plans were submitted to the los angeles city council multiple accounts exist for the origin of the star concept according to one the historic hollywood hotel—which stood for more than 50 years on hollywood boulevard at the site now occupied by the hollywood and highland complex and the dolby formerly kodak theatre16—displayed stars on its dining room ceiling above the tables favored by its most famous celebrity patrons and that may have served as an early inspiration17 by another account the stars were inspired by sugarmans tropics restaurant drinks menu which featured celebrity photos framed in gold stars1518 in february 1956 a prototype was unveiled featuring a caricature of an example honoree john wayne by some accounts19 inside a blue star on a brown background14 however caricatures proved too expensive and difficult to execute in brass with the technology available at the time and the brown and blue motif was vetoed by charles e toberman the legendary real estate developer known as mr hollywood because the colors clashed with a new building he was erecting on hollywood boulevard1420 selection and constructionedit by march 1956 the final design and coralandcharcoal color scheme had been approved and between the spring of 1956 and the fall of 1957 1558 honorees were selected by committees representing the four major branches of the entertainment industry at that time motion pictures television audio recording and radio the committees met at the brown derby restaurant21 and included such prominent names as cecil b demille samuel goldwyn jesse l lasky walt disney hal roach mack sennett and walter lantz14 woodwards star contrary to popular belief was not the first a requirement stipulated by the original audio recording committee and later rescinded specified minimum sales of one million records or 250000 albums for all music category nominees the committee soon realized that many important recording artists would be excluded from the walk by that requirement as a result the national academy of recording arts and sciences was formed for the purpose of creating a separate award system for the music business the first grammy awards were presented in beverly hills in 195922 construction of the walk began in 1958 but two lawsuits delayed completion the first was filed by local property owners challenging the legality of the 125 million tax assessment levied upon them to pay for the walk along with new street lighting and trees in october 1959 the assessment was ruled legal14 the second lawsuit filed by charles chaplin jr sought damages for the exclusion of his father whose nomination had been withdrawn due to pressure from multiple quarters see controversial additions chaplins suit was dismissed in 1960 paving the way for completion of the project142324 while joanne woodward is often singled out as the first to receive a star on the walk of fame25 in fact there was no first recipient the original stars were installed as a continuous project with no individual ceremonies woodwards name was one of eight drawn at random from the original 1558 and inscribed on eight prototype stars that were built while litigation was still holding up permanent construction262728 the eight prototypes were installed temporarily on the northwest corner of hollywood boulevard and highland avenue in august 1958 to generate publicity and to demonstrate how the walk would eventually look14 the other seven names were olive borden ronald colman louise fazenda preston foster burt lancaster edward sedgwick and ernest torrence1429 official groundbreaking took place on february 8 196017 on march 28 1960 the first permanent star director stanley kramers was completed on the easternmost end of the new walk near the intersection of hollywood and gower1430 the joanne woodward legend may have originated according to one source because she was the first to pose with her star for photographers25 stagnation and revitalizationedit though the walk was originally conceived in part to encourage redevelopment of hollywood boulevard the 1960s and 1970s were periods of protracted urban decay in the hollywood area as residents moved to suburbs3132 after the initial installation of approximately 1500 stars in 1960 and 1961 eight years passed without the addition of a new star in 1962 the los angeles city council passed an ordinance naming the hollywood chamber of commerce the agent to advise the city about adding names to the walk and the chamber over the following six years devised rules procedures and financing methods to do so14 in december 1968 richard d zanuck was awarded the first star in eight years in a presentation ceremony hosted by danny thomas142133 in july 1978 the city of los angeles designated the hollywood walk of fame a los angeles historiccultural monument34 johnny grant center at producer joe pasternaks presentation ceremony in 1991 at left is gene kelly radio personality television producer and chamber member johnny grant is generally credited with implementing the changes that resuscitated the walk and established it as a significant tourist attraction2135 beginning in 1968 he stimulated publicity and encouraged international press coverage by requiring that each recipient personally attend his or her stars unveiling ceremony21 grant later recalled that it was tough to get people to come accept a star until the neighborhood finally began its recovery in the 1980s32 in 1980 he instituted a fee of 2500 payable by the person or entity nominating the recipient to fund the walk of fames upkeep and minimize further taxpayer burden21 the fee has increased incrementally over time by 2002 it had reached 1500036 and stood at 30000 in 20124 the current 2017 fee is 4000037 grant was awarded a star in 1980 for his television work14 in 2002 he received a second star in the special category to acknowledge his pivotal role in improving and popularizing the walk38 he was also named chairman of the selection committee and honorary mayor of hollywood a ceremonial position previously held by art linkletter and monty hall3940 among others1438 he remained in both offices from 1980 until his death in 2008 and hosted the great majority of unveiling ceremonies during that period his unique specialcategory star with its emblem depicting a stylized great seal of the city of hollywood41 is located at the entrance to the dolby theatre adjacent to johnny grant way42 expansionedit in 1984 a fifth category live theatre was added to permit acknowledgment of contributions from the live performance branch of the entertainment industry and a second row of stars was created on each sidewalk to alternate with the existing stars14 hollywood boulevard 7000 block north side looking westward in 1994 the walk of fame was extended one block to the west on hollywood boulevard from sycamore avenue to north labrea avenue plus the short segment of marshfield way that connects hollywood and la brea where it now ends at the silver four ladies of hollywood gazebo and the special walk of fame star43 at the same time sophia loren was honored with the 2000th star on the walk14 during construction of tunnels for the los angeles subway system in 1996 the metropolitan transportation authority removed and stored more than 300 stars44 controversy arose when the mta proposed a moneysaving measure of jackhammering the 3by3foot terrazzo pads preserving only the brass lettering surrounds and medallions then pouring new terrazzo after the tunnels were completed45 but the cultural heritage commission ruled that the star pads were to be removed intact46 restorationedit in 2008 a longterm restoration project began with an evaluation of all 2365 stars on the walk at the time each receiving a letter grade of a b c d or f honorees whose stars received f grades indicating the most severe damage were joan collins peter frampton dick van patten paul douglas andrew l stone willard waterman richard boleslavsky ellen drew frank crumit and bobby sherwood fifty celebrities stars received d grades the damage ranged from minor cosmetic flaws caused by normal weathering to holes and fissures severe enough to constitute a walking hazard at least 778 stars will eventually be repaired or replaced during the ongoing project at an estimated cost of 4 million to 42 million47 the restoration is a collaboration among the hollywood chamber of commerce and various los angeles city and county governmental offices along with the mta which operates the metro red line that runs beneath the walk since earth movement due to the presence of the subway line is thought to be partly responsible for the damage48 to encourage supplemental funding for the project by corporate sponsors the friends of walk of fame program was inaugurated47 absolut vodka became the first friend with a donation of 1 million4950 followed by loréal51 friends are recognized with honorary plaques adjacent to the walk of fame in front of the dolby theatre10 the program received some criticism alana semuels of the los angeles times described it as just the latest corporate attempt to buy some good buzz and quoting an area brand strategist i think johnny grant would roll over in his grave10 karen fondu president of loréal paris countered that the association was a natural affinity50 the walk of fame todayedit multiple starsedit the original selection committees chose to recognize some entertainers contributions in multiple categories with multiple stars gene autry is the only honoree with stars in all five categories5253 bob hope mickey rooney roy rogers and tony martin each have stars in four categories—rooney has three of his own and a fourth with his eighth and final wife jan5455 while rogers also has three of his own and a fourth with his band sons of the pioneers5657 thirtythree people including bing crosby frank sinatra dean martin dinah shore gale storm danny kaye douglas fairbanks jr and jack benny have stars in three categories52 seven recording artists have two stars in the same category for distinct achievements michael jackson as a soloist and as a member of the jackson 5 diana ross as a member of the supremes and for her solo work smokey robinson as a solo artist and as a member of the miracles and john lennon ringo starr george harrison and paul mccartney as individuals and as members of the beatles58 cher forfeited her opportunity by declining to schedule the mandatory personal appearance when she was selected in 198359 she did attend the unveiling of the sonny cher star in 1998 as a tribute to her recently deceased exhusband sonny bono60 george eastman is the only honoree with two stars in the same category for the same achievement the invention of roll film61 in 1977 country singer loretta lynn was the first of her genre to receive a star on the walk of fame controversial additionsedit selected 1956 installed 1972 charlie chaplin is the only honoree to be selected twice for the same star on the walk he was unanimously voted into the initial group of 500 in 1956 but the selection committee ultimately excluded him ostensibly due to questions regarding his morals he had been charged with violating the mann act—and exonerated—during the white slavery hysteria of the 1940s62 but more likely due to his leftleaning political views63 the rebuke prompted an unsuccessful lawsuit by his son charles chaplin jr his star was finally added to the walk in 1972 the same year he received his academy award24 but even then 16 years later the chamber of commerce received angry letters from across the country protesting its decision to include him64 the committees chaplin difficulties reportedly contributed to its decision in 1978 against awarding a star to paul robeson the brilliant but controversial opera singer actor athlete writer lawyer and social activist65 the resulting outcry from the entertainment industry civic circles local and national politicians and many other quarters was so intense that the decision was reversed and robeson was awarded a star in 1979666768

the barrymore family john barrymore his brother lionel who has two and sister ethel their uncle sidney drew johns son john drew barrymore and john drews daughter drew barrymore bending the rulesedit one of the four monuments recognizing the apollo 11 astronauts at the corners of hollywood and vine walk of fame rules prohibit consideration of nominees whose contributions fall outside the five major entertainment categories but the selection committee has been known to conjure some interesting rule interpretations to justify a selection the walks four round moon landing monuments at the corners of hollywood and vine for example officially recognize the apollo 11 astronauts for contributions to the television industry johnny grant acknowledged in 2005 that classifying the first moon landing as a television entertainment event was a bit of a stretch magic johnsons considerable basketball skills had no direct connection to movies music tv radio or theater but the committee added him to the motion picture category based on his ownership of the magic johnson theatre chain citing as precedent sid grauman builder of graumans now tcl chinese theatre now people want orville redenbacher grant quipped in the 2005 interview because his popcorn is in all the theaters25 muhammad alis star was granted after the committee decided that boxing could be considered a form of live performance its placement on a wall of the dolby theatre makes it the only star mounted on a vertical surface acceding to alis request that his name not be walked upon7273 all living honorees have been required since 1968 to personally attend their stars unveiling and approximately 40 have declined the honor due to this condition25 the only recipient to date who failed to appear after agreeing to do so was barbra streisand in 1976 her star was unveiled anyway near the intersection of hollywood and highland74 streisand did attend when her husband james brolin unveiled his star in 1998 two

represented by a single star is the estimated 122 adults and 12 children76 collectively known as the munchkins from the landmark 1939 film the wizard of oz clayton moore is so inextricably linked with his lone ranger character even though he played other roles during his career that he is one of only two actors to have his characters name alongside his own on his star the other is tommy riggs whose star reads tommy riggs betty lou77 for more than 40 years singer jimmy boyd was the youngest star recipient at age 20 but he lost that distinction in 2004 to 18yearold twins marykate and ashley olsen

kids honorees may request a specific location for their star although final decisions remain with the chamber25 jay leno for example requested a spot near the corner of hollywood blvd and highland ave because he was twice picked up at that location by police for vagrancy though never actually charged shortly after his arrival in hollywood86 george carlin chose to have his star placed in front of

the historic warner brothers theatre now the hollywood pacific theatre during the 1951 run of alfred hitchcocks film strangers on a train she took it upon herself to advise a couple arriving during

removed from the walk of fame9293 for 28 years the star intended to honor mauritz stiller the helsinkiborn pioneer of swedish film who brought greta garbo to the united states read maurice diller

remade one of gene autrys five stars it is not clear which one was also stolen from a construction area johnny grant later received an anonymous phone tip that the missing star was in iowa but it was never found someday it will end up on ebay grant once joked the most brazen and ambitious theft occurred in 2005 when thieves used a concrete saw to remove gregory pecks star from its hollywood boulevard site at the intersection of north el centro avenue near north gower the star was replaced almost immediately but the original was never recovered and the perpetrators never caught114 in late 2009 rumors circulated widely on media outlets and the internet that john lennons star had been stolen but it was merely being relocated farther south on vine street to an area near the circular capitol records building adjacent to the stars of bandmates george harrison and ringo starr115 paul mccartneys star was installed in the same location in 2012116 donald trumps star—received as host of the apprentice television series—was repeatedly defaced during the 2016 presidential campaign117118119 in late october near the end of the race a man named jamie otis who claimed to be an heir to the otis elevator fortune used a sledge hammer and a pickaxe to destroy all of the stars brass inlays he readily admitted to the vandalism which he described as civil disobedience and freedom of expression and told reporters that he originally planned to remove the entire star and auction it to raise money for the women who accused trump of sexually assaulting them120 otis was arrested three

tribute to the multiethnic women of hollywood125 the gazebo is a stainless steel stylized art deco lattice structure the roof is an arched square supporting a circular dome which is topped by a central obelisk with descending neon block letters spelling hollywood on each of its four sides atop the obelisk is a small gilded weathervanestyle sculpture of marilyn monroe in her iconic billowing skirt pose from the seven year itch126 the domed structure is held aloft by four caryatids sculpted by harl west125 to represent the africanamerican actress dorothy dandridge asianamerican actress anna may wong mexican actress dolores del río and the multiethnic brooklynborn actress mae west124 the gazebo was dedicated on february 1 1994 to a mixed reception los angeles times art critic christopher knight called it the most depressingly awful work of public art in recent years representing the opposite of hardwickes intended tribute to women sex as a womans historic gateway to hollywood he wrote couldnt be more explicitly described127 independent writer and film producer gail choice called it a fitting tribute to a group of pioneering and courageous women who carried a tremendous burden on their feminine shoulders never in my wildest dreams did i believe id ever see women of color immortalized in such a creative and wonderful fashion128 hardwicke contended that critics had missed the humor and symbolism of the structure which embraces and pokes fun at the glamour the polished metallic male form of the oscar and the pastiche of styles and dreams that pervades

conflicts of interest and to discourage lobbying by celebrities and their representatives a significant problem during the original selections in the late 1950s however in 1999 in response to intensifying charges of secrecy in the selection process the chamber disclosed the members names johnny grant the longtime chair and representative of the television category earl lestz president of paramount studio group motion pictures stan spero retired manager with broadcast stations kmpc and kabc radio kate nelson owner of the palace theatre live performance and mary lou dudas vice president of am records recording industry135 since that 1999 announcement the chamber has revealed only that lestz who received his own star in 2004 became chairman after grant died in 2008 their current official position is that each of the five categories is represented by someone with expertise in that field4 in 2010 lestz was replaced as chairman by john pavlik former director of communications for the academy of motion picture arts and sciences136 while no public announcement was made to that effect he was identified as chairman in the chambers press release announcing the 2011 star recipients137 the current chair according to the chambers 2016 selection announcement is film producer maureen schultz138 homageedit michael jacksons star about two weeks after his death in 2009 some
