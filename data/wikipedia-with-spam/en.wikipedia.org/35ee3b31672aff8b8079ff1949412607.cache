protection policy v t e fully protected templateprotected semiprotected create protected move protected upload protected pending changes protected extended confirmed protection protected by office cascade protected wikipedia is built around the principle that anyone can edit it and it therefore aims to have as many of its pages as possible open for public editing so that anyone can add material and correct errors however in some particular circumstances because of a specifically identified likelihood of damage resulting if editing is left open some individual pages may need to be subject to technical restrictions often only temporary but sometimes indefinitely on who is permitted to modify them the placing of such restrictions on pages is called protection protection can only be applied to or removed from pages by wikipedias administrators although any user may request protection protection can be indefinite or expire after a specified time period the most commonly encountered types of protection are full protection which means that a page can be modified only by administrators and semiprotection which means that a page can be modified only by users who are logged in and whose accounts have been confirmed any account is automatically confirmed if it has existed for at least 4 days and has made at least 10 edits other forms of protection are detailed below protected pages are normally marked with a small padlock symbol in the top corner different color padlocks represent different protection types as shown in the images at the right ppprotected is usually placed on protected pages to display the padlock positioning the mouse pointer over the padlock symbol produces an informational tooltip which says this article is protected if ppprotecteds reason parameter is specified the tooltip also says why the page is protected if the expiry parameter is specified the tooltip says for what duration the page is protected this policy explains in detail the protection

options are available to administrators for protecting pages full protection prevents editing by everyone except administrators fully protected media files cannot be overwritten by new uploads semiprotection prevents editing by unregistered contributors and contributors with accounts that are not confirmed creation protection prevents a page normally a previously deleted one from being recreated also known as salting move protection protects the page solely from moving renaming upload protection prevents new versions of a file from being uploaded except by administrators but it does not prevent editing the files description page pendingchanges protection means edits by unregistered and new contributors are not visible to readers who are not logged in until the edits are approved by a reviewer or administrator extended confirmed protection also known as 30500 protection prevents editing by users without 30 days tenure and 500 edits on the english wikipedia it is applied to combat any form of disruption where semiprotection has proven to be ineffective it should not be applied as a protection level of first resort its use is logged at the administrators noticeboard any type of protection with the exception of cascading protection may be requested at wikipediarequests for page protection changes to a fully protected page should be proposed on the corresponding talk page and carried out by an administrator if they are uncontroversial or if there is consensus for them except in the case of office actions see below arbitration committee remedies or pages in the mediawiki namespace see below administrators may unprotect a page if the reason for its protection no longer applies a reasonable period has elapsed and there is no consensus that continued protection is necessary editors desiring the unprotection of a page should in the first instance ask the administrator who applied the protection unless the administrator is inactive or no longer an administrator thereafter requests may be made at requests for unprotection note that such requests will normally be declined if the protecting administrator is active and was not consulted first a log of protections and unprotections is available at speciallogprotect interaction of wikipedia user groups and page protection levels   unregistered or newly registered autoconfirmed confirmed extended

wikipedia in all cases throughout this table changes are immediately visible to readers who are logged in the vast majority of pages pending changes protection can edit changes go live after reviewer acceptance normal editing if there are previous pending changes no changes will go live until the pending changes have been reviewed normal editing can accept pending changes infrequently edited articles with high levels of vandalism or blp violations from unregistered and new users semiprotection cannot edit normal editing articles with high levels of vandalism or edit warring from unregistered and new users some highly visible templates modules extended confirmed protection cannot edit normal editing specific topic areas authorized by arbcom pages subject to persistent

articles with persistent vandalism or edit warring from autoconfirmed accounts critical templates modules when an administrator or pending changes reviewer edits an article that has pending changes awaiting review they must review the pending changes before their own edit goes live this row assumes that a pending changes reviewer is also extended confirmed a pending changes reviewer needs separate extended confirmed rights to edit through extended confirmed protection in practice nearly all pending changes reviewers will have that additional right view · talk · edit types of protection full protection policy shortcuts wpfull wpgoldlock a fully protected page can be edited or moved only by administrators the protection may be for a specified time or may be indefinite modifications to a fully protected page can be proposed on its talk page or at another appropriate forum for discussion administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting consensus placing the edit fullyprotected template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes content disputes content disputes and edit warring may be addressed with blocks issued by uninvolved administrators while allowing normal page editing by other editors under the protection policy an alternative approach is available as administrators have the discretion to temporarily fully protect an article to end an ongoing edit war this approach may be better suited to multiparty disputes and contentious content as talk page consensus becomes a requirement for implementation of requested edits policy shortcut wpprefer when protecting a page because of a content dispute administrators have a duty to avoid protecting a version that contains policyviolating content such as vandalism copyright violations defamation or poorquality coverage of living people administrators remain uninvolved when exercising their discretion subject to this proviso to decide whether to apply protection to the most current version of an article or to an older stable or preeditwar version protected pages may not be edited except to make changes that are uncontroversial or for which there is clear consensus editors convinced that the protected version of an article contains policyviolating content or that protection has rewarded edit warring or disruption by establishing a contentious revision may identify a stable version prior to the edit war and request reversion to that version before making such a request editors should consider how independent editors might view the suggestion and recognise that continuing an edit war is grounds for being blocked administrators who have made substantive content changes to an article are considered involved and must not use their advanced permissions to further their own positions when involved in a dispute it is almost always wisest to respect the editing policies that bind all editors and call for input from an uninvolved administrator rather than to invite controversy by acting unilaterally vandalism policy shortcuts wpnopreempt wppreemptive applying page protection in a preemptive measure is contrary to the open nature of wikipedia and is generally not allowed if applied for these reasons however brief periods of an appropriate and reasonable protection level are allowed in situations where blatant vandalism or disruption is occurring and at a level of frequency that requires its use in order to stop it the duration of the protection should be set as short as possible and the protection level should be set to the lowest restriction needed in order to stop the disruption while still allowing productive editors to make changes history only review policy shortcut wpppdrv if a deleted page is going through deletion review only administrators are normally capable of viewing the former content of the page if they feel it would benefit the discussion to allow other users to view the page content administrators may restore the page blank it or replace the contents with tempundelete or a similar notice and fully protect the page to prevent further editing the previous contents of the page are then accessible to everyone via the page history protected generic image names generic image names such as filemapjpg or filephotojpg are fully protected to prevent new versions being uploaded permanent protection policy shortcuts wpppindef wppermpro some areas of wikipedia are permanently protected by the mediawiki software the mediawiki namespace which defines parts of the site interface is fully protected it is impossible for administrators to remove this protection user css and javascript pages such as userexamplemonobookcss and userexamplecolognebluejs are automatically fully protected only accounts that are associated with these pages or administrators are able to edit them this protection applies to any user subpage created with a css or js extension whether an equivalent mediawiki skin exists or not administrators may modify these pages for example to remove a user script that has been used in an inappropriate way in addition to hardcoded protection the following are usually permanently protected pages that are very visible such as the main page or filewikipng pages that should not be modified for copyright or legal reasons such as the general disclaimer or the local copy of the site copyright license pages that are very frequently transcluded such as tl or ambox to prevent vandalism or denial of service attacks this includes images or templates used in other highly visible or frequently transcluded pages see wikipediahighrisk templates for more information template protection policy shortcuts wptprot wppinklock main page wikipediatemplate editor a templateprotected page can be edited only by administrators or users in the template editors group this protection level should be used almost exclusively on highrisk templates and modules in cases where pages in other namespaces become transcluded to a very high degree this protection level is also valid this is a protection level1 that replaces full protection on pages that are merely protected due to high transclusion rates rather than content disputes it should be used on templates whose risk factor would have otherwise warranted full protection it should not be used on less risky templates on the grounds that the template editor user right exists – the existence of the right should not result in more templates becoming uneditable for the general editing community editors may request edits to a templateprotected page by proposing them on its talk page using the edit templateprotected template if necessary to gain attention semiprotection policy shortcuts wpsemi wpsilverlock see also wikipediarough guide to semiprotection semiprotection prevents edits from unregistered users ip addresses as well as edits from any account that is not autoconfirmed is at least four days old and has at least ten edits to wikipedia or confirmed this level of protection is useful when there is a significant amount of disruption or vandalism from new or unregistered users or to prevent sock puppets of blocked or banned users from editing especially when it occurs on biographies of living persons who have had a recent high level of media interest an alternative to semiprotection is pending changes which is sometimes favoured when an article is being vandalised regularly but otherwise receives a low amount of editing such users can request edits to a semiprotected page by proposing them on its talk page using the edit semiprotected template if necessary to gain attention if the page in question and its talk page are both protected please make your edit request at wikipediarequest for edit instead new users may also request the confirmed user right by visiting requests for permissions guidance for administrators administrators may apply indefinite semiprotection to pages that are subject to heavy and persistent vandalism or violations of content policy such as biographies of living persons neutral point of view semiprotection should not be used as a preemptive measure against vandalism that has not yet occurred nor should it be used to privilege registered users over unregistered users in valid content disputes in addition administrators may apply temporary semiprotection on pages that are subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption for example due to media attention when blocking individual users is not a feasible option subject to editwarring where all parties involved are unregistered or new editors ie in cases in which full protection would otherwise be applied this does not apply when autoconfirmed users are involved subject to vandalism or editwarring where unregistered editors are engaging in ip hopping by using different computers obtaining new addresses by using dynamic ip allocation or other addresschanging schemes such as ip address spoofing article discussion pages when they have been subject to persistent disruption such protection should be used sparingly because it prevents unregistered and newly registered users from participating in discussions a page and its talk page should not normally be protected at the same time if a page and its talk page are both protected the talk page should direct affected editors to wikipediarequest for edit to ensure that no editor is entirely prevented from contributing protection should be used sparingly on the talk pages of blocked users including ip addresses instead the user should be reblocked with talk page editing disallowed when required or when reblocking without talk page editing allowed is unsuccessful protection should be implemented for only a brief period and not exceeding the duration of the block todays featured article may be semiprotected just like any other article but since this article is subject to sudden spurts of vandalism during certain times of day administrators should semiprotect it for brief periods in most instances for the former guideline see wikipediamain page featured article protection creation protection policy shortcuts wpsalt wpskybluelock administrators can prevent the creation of a page through the protection interface this is useful for bad articles that have been deleted but repeatedly recreated such protection is casesensitive there are several levels of creation protection that can be applied to pages identical to the levels for edit protection a list of protected titles may be found at specialprotectedtitles see also historical lists preemptive restrictions on new article titles are instituted through the title blacklist system which allows for more flexible protection with support for substrings and regular expressions pages that have been creationprotected are sometimes referred to as salted contributors wishing to recreate a salted title with more appropriate content should either contact an administrator preferably the protecting administrator file a request at wikipediarequests for page protection or use the deletion review process in any case it is generally preferable to have prepared a draft version of the intended article prior to filing a request based on the consensus of certain articles for deletion discussion that close as redirect administrators may decide to protect the resulting redirect to prevent its conversion into an article without consensus administrators should choose the appropriate level of create protection – semi extendedconfirmed2 or full use of semi create protection is rare because ip editors can not create articles move protection policy shortcuts wpmovp wpgreenlock move protected pages or more technically fully moveprotected pages cannot be moved to a new title except by an administrator move protection is commonly applied to pages subject to persistent pagemove vandalism pages subject to a pagename dispute highly visible pages that have no reason to be moved such as the administrators noticeboard and articles selected as todays featured article on the main page fully editprotected pages are also implicitly moveprotected as with full edit protection protection because of edit warring should not be considered an endorsement of the current name when move protection is applied during a requested move discussion the page should be protected at the location it was at when the move request was started all files are implicitly moveprotected only file movers and administrators can move files upload protection policy shortcuts wpuploadp wppurplelock upload protected files or more technically fully uploadprotected files cannot be replaced with new versions except by an administrator upload protection does not protect file pages from editing upload protection may be applied by an administrator to files subject to persistent upload vandalism files subject to a dispute between editors files that should not be replaced such as images used in the interface or transcluded to the main page files with common or generic names as with full edit protection administrators should avoid favoring one file version over another and protection should not be considered an endorsement of the current file version an obvious exception to this rule is when files are protected due to upload vandalism pending changes protection further information wikipediapending changes policy shortcuts wppcpp wpwhitelock pending changes protection is a tool used to suppress vandalism and certain other persistent problems while allowing all users to continue to submit edits pending changes protection can be used as an alternative to semiprotection to allow unregistered and new users to edit pages while keeping the edits hidden from the view of most readers until those changes are accepted by a reviewer when a page under pending changes protection is edited by an unregistered ip addresses editor or a new user the edit is not directly visible to the majority of wikipedia readers until it is reviewed and accepted by an editor with the pending changes reviewer right when a page under pending changes protection is edited by an autoconfirmed user the edit will be immediately visible to wikipedia readers pending changes are visible in the page history where they are marked as pending review readers not logged in the vast majority of readers are shown the latest accepted version of the page loggedin users see the latest version of the page with all changes reviewed or not applied when editors who are not reviewers make changes to an article with unreviewed pending changes their edits are also marked as pending and are not visible to most readers a user who clicks edit this page is always at that point shown the latest version of the page for editing regardless of whether the user is logged in or not if the editor is not logged in his or her changes join any other changes to the article awaiting review – for the present they remain hidden from notloggedinusers this means that when the editor looks at the article after saving he wont see the change he just made if the editor is logged in and a pending changes reviewer and there are pending changes the editor will be prompted to review the pending changes before editing – see helppending changes if the editor is logged in and not a pending changes reviewer then if there are no unreviewed pending edits waiting this editors edits will be visible to everyone immediately but if there are unreviewed pending edits waiting then this editors edits will be visible only to other loggedin users including himself immediately but not to readers not logged in reviewing of pending changes should be resolved within reasonable time limits when to apply pending changes protection pending changes may be used to protect articles against persistent vandalism violations of the biographies of living persons policy copyright violations pending changes protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against violations that have not yet occurred like semiprotection pc protection should never be used in genuine content disputes where there is a risk of placing a particular group of editors unregistered users at a disadvantage pending changes protection should not be used on articles with a very high edit rate even if they meet the aforementioned criteria instead semiprotection should be considered in addition administrators may apply temporary pending changes protection on pages that are subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption for example due to media attention when blocking individual users is not a feasible option as with other forms of protection the time frame of the protection should be proportional to the problem indefinite pc protection should only be used in cases of severe longterm disruption removal of pending changes protection can be requested of any administrator or at requests for unprotection the reviewing process is described in detail at reviewing pending changes extended confirmed protection policy shortcuts wpecp wpbluelock see also wikipediarough guide to extended confirmed protection extended confirmed protection also known as 30500 protection prevents edits from all ip editors and any registered user with less than 30 days tenure or fewer than 500 edits pages with this level of protection can be edited only by editors with the extended confirmed user access level granted automatically to editors with the requisite tenure and number of edits in cases where semiprotection has proven to be ineffective administrators may use extended confirmed protection to combat disruption such as vandalism abusive sockpuppetry edit wars etc on any topic extended confirmed protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against disruption that has not yet occurred nor should it be used to privilege extended confirmed users over unregistered users in valid content disputes on articles not covered by arbitration committee 30500 rulings extended confirmed protection may be used at administrator discretion when creation protecting a page2 30500 protection formerly until august 12 20163 only applied in topic areas determined by the arbitration committee which

superprotect shortcut wpsuperprotect superprotect was a level of protection allowing editing by only wikimedia foundation employees who are in the staff global group it was implemented on august 10 2014 and used the same day to override community consensus regarding the use of the media viewer on the german wikipedias primary site javascript commonjs it was never used on the english wikipedia on november 5 2015 the wmf decided to remove superprotect from all wikimedia wikis cascading semiprotection cascading semiprotection was formerly possible but it was disabled in 2007 after users noticed that nonadministrators could protect any page by transcluding it onto the page to which cascading semiprotection had been applied by an administrator pending changes protection level 2 originally two levels of pending changes protection existed following a community discussion level 2 which required review of edits by all users that are not reviewers was retired from the english wikipedia in january 2017 it was suggested at that time that pending changes level 1 be referred to in future as simply pending changes8 protection by namespace article talk pages modifications to a protected page can be proposed on its talk page or at another appropriate forum for discussion administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting consensus placing the edit protected template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes talk pages are not usually protected and are only semiprotected for a limited duration in the most severe cases of vandalism user talk pages user talk pages are rarely protected and are semiprotected for short durations only in the most severe cases of vandalism from ip users users whose talk pages are semiprotected should have an unprotected user talk subpage linked conspicuously from their main talk page to allow good faith comments from nonautoconfirmed users a users request to have his or her own talk page protected is not a sufficient rationale to protect the page blocked users blocked users user talk pages should not ordinarily be protected as this interferes with the users ability to contest their block through the normal process it also prevents others from being able to use the talk page to communicate with the blocked editor in extreme cases of abuse by the blocked user such as abuse of the unblock template reblocking the user without talk page access should be preferred over protection if the user has been indefinitely blocked from editing the talk page they should be informed of offwiki ways to appeal their block such as the utrs tool interface or as a last recourse the arbitration committee when required protection should be implemented for only a brief period not exceeding the duration of the block confirmed socks of registered users should be dealt with in accordance with wikipediasockpuppetry their pages are not normally protected user pages policy shortcuts wpuprot wpupprot base user pages for example the page userexample and not userexamplesubpage or user talkexample are automatically protected from creation or editing by unconfirmed and ip users exceptions to this include when an unconfirmed or ip user attempts to edit their own user page ip and unconfirmed editors are also unable to create or edit user pages that do not belong to a registered user this protection is enforced by a filter9 users may optout of this protection by placing unlocked userpage anywhere on their own page user pages and subpages may be protected upon a request from the user as long as a need exists—pages in userspace should not be automatically or preemptively protected10 requests for protection specifically at uncommon levels such as template protection may be granted if the user has expressed a genuine and realistic need when a filter is insufficient to stop user page vandalism a user may choose to create a css subpage ex userexampleuserpagecss copy all the contents of their user page onto the subpage transclude the subpage by putting userexampleuserpagecss on their user page and then ask an administrator to fully protect their user page because pages in user space that end in js and css are only editable by the user the user space belongs to and administrators this will protect your user page from further vandalism deceased users see also wikipediadeceased wikipediansguidelines in the event of the confirmed death of a user the users user page but not the user talk page should be fully protected protection of templates shortcut wpptprot see also wikipediahighrisk templates and wikipediatemplate documentation highly visible templates which are used on an extremely large number of pages or substituted with great frequency are often semi or templateprotected based on the degree of visibility type of use content etc protected templates should normally have the documentation template it loads the unprotected doc page so that nonadmins and ipusers can edit the documentation categories and interwiki links it also automatically adds pptemplate to protected templates which displays a small padlock in the top right corner and categorizes the template as protected only manually add pptemplate to protected templates that dont use documentation mostly the flag templates cascading protection should generally not be applied directly to templates as it will not protect transclusions inside includeonly tags or transclusions that depend on template parameters but will protect the templates documentation subpage instead consider any of the following if the set of subtemplates is static even if large protect them using normal protection mechanisms if the set of subtemplates is unbounded use mediawikititleblacklist to protect all subtemplates using a particular naming format as is done for editnotice templates and subtemplates of templatetfa title note all editnotice templates except those in userspace are already protected via mediawikititleblacklist which can however be overridden by template editors sandboxes see also wikipediaabout the sandbox sandboxes should not ordinarily be protected since their purpose is to let new users test and experiment with wiki syntax most sandboxes are automatically cleaned every 12 hours although they are frequently
