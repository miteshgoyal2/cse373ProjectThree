mccain jr was named commander of all us forces in the vietnam theater and the north vietnamese offered mccain early release43 because they wanted to appear merciful for propaganda purposes44 and also to show other pows that elite prisoners were willing to be treated preferentially43 mccain refused repatriation unless every man taken in before him was also released such early release was prohibited by the pows interpretation of the military code of conduct which states in article iii “i will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy”45 to prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda officers were to agree to be released in the order in which they were captured34 beginning in august 1968 mccain was subjected to a program of severe torture46 he was bound and beaten every two hours this punishment occurred at the same time that he was suffering from dysentery3446 further injuries led mccain to attempt suicide which was stopped by guards34 eventually mccain made an antius propaganda confession34 he has always felt that his statement was dishonorable but as he later wrote i had learned what we all learned over there every man has his breaking point i had reached mine4748 many us pows were tortured and maltreated in order to extract confessions and propaganda statements49 virtually all of them eventually yielded something to their captors50 mccain received two to three beatings weekly because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements51 mccain refused to meet various antiwar groups seeking peace in hanoi wanting to give neither them nor the north vietnamese a propaganda victory52 from late 1969 treatment of mccain and many of the other pows became more tolerable53 while mccain continued actively to resist the camp authorities54 mccain

leave the navy it was doubtful whether he would ever be promoted to the rank of full admiral as he had poor annual physicals and had been given no major sea command68 his chances of being promoted to

mccain met twice with federal regulators to discuss the governments investigation of lincoln98 in 1999 mccain said the appearance of it was wrong its a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence and it was the wrong thing to do101 in the end mccain was cleared by the senate ethics committee of acting improperly or violating any law or senate rule but was mildly rebuked for exercising poor judgment99101 in his 1992 reelection bid the keating five affair was not a major issue102

our constitution it is the presidents call to make111 mccain had also voted to confirm nominees of presidents ronald reagan and george hw bush including robert bork and clarence thomas112 mccain attacked what he saw as the corrupting influence of large political contributions – from corporations labor unions other organizations and wealthy individuals – and he made this his signature issue113 starting in 1994 he worked with democratic wisconsin senator russ feingold on campaign finance reform their mccain–feingold bill attempted to put limits on soft money113 the efforts of mccain and feingold were opposed by some of the moneyed interests targeted by incumbents in both parties by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech and might be unconstitutional as well and by those who wanted to counterbalance the power of what they saw as media bias113114 despite sympathetic coverage in the media initial versions of the mccain–feingold act were filibustered and never came to a vote115 the term maverick republican became a label frequently applied to mccain and he has also used it himself113116117 in 1993 mccain opposed military operations in somalia118

in order to fund antismoking campaigns discourage teenage smokers increase money for health research studies and help states pay for smokingrelated health care costs113122 supported by the clinton

before and during the vietnam war concluding with his release from captivity in 1973 according to one reviewer it describes the kind of challenges that most of us can barely imagine its a fascinating history of a remarkable military family130 2000 presidential campaign main article john mccain presidential campaign 2000 mccain announced his candidacy for president on september 27 1999 in nashua new hampshire saying he was staging a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve126131 the frontrunner for the republican nomination was texas governor george w bush who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment132 mccain focused on the new hampshire primary where his message appealed to independents133 he traveled on a campaign bus called the straight talk express126 he held many town hall meetings answering every question voters asked in a successful example of retail politics and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds126 one reporter later recounted that mccain talked all day long with reporters on his straight talk express bus he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he shouldnt have and thats why the media loved him134 on february 1 2000 he won new hampshires primary with 49 percent of the vote to bushs 30 percent the bush campaign and the republican establishment feared that a mccain victory in the crucial south carolina primary might give his campaign unstoppable momentum126135 mccains gallup poll favorableunfavorable ratings 1999–2009136 the arizona republic would write that the mccain–bush primary contest in south carolina has entered national political lore as a lowwater mark in presidential campaigns while the new york times called it a painful symbol of the brutality of american politics126137138 a variety of interest groups that mccain had challenged in the past ran negative ads126139 bush borrowed mccains earlier language of reform140 and declined to dissociate himself from a veterans activist who accused mccain in bushs presence of having abandoned the veterans on powmia and agent orange issues126141 incensed141 mccain ran ads accusing bush of lying and comparing the governor to bill clinton which bush said was about as low a blow as you can give in a republican primary126 an anonymous smear campaign began against mccain delivered by push polls faxes emails flyers and audience plants126142 the smears claimed that mccain had fathered a black child out of wedlock the mccains darkskinned daughter was adopted from bangladesh that his wife cindy was a drug addict that he was a homosexual and that he was a manchurian candidate who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his north vietnam pow days126137 the bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with the attacks137143 mccain lost south carolina on february 19 with 42 percent of the vote to bushs 53 percent144 in part because bush mobilized the states evangelical voters126145 and outspent mccain146 the win allowed bush to regain lost momentum144 mccain would say of the rumor spreaders i believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those89 according to one report the south carolina experience left mccain in a very dark place137 mccains campaign never completely recovered from his south carolina defeat although he did rebound partially by winning in arizona and michigan a few days later147 he made a speech in virginia beach that criticized christian leaders including pat robertson and jerry falwell as divisive conservatives137 declaring  we embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community but that does not mean that we will pander to their selfappointed leaders148 mccain lost the virginia primary on february 29149 and on march 7 lost nine of the thirteen primaries on super tuesday to bush150 with little hope of overcoming bushs delegate lead mccain withdrew from the race on march 9 2000151 he endorsed bush two months later152 and made occasional appearances with the texas governor during the general election

the bush tax cuts153154 besides the differences with bush on ideological grounds there was considerable antagonism between the two remaining from the previous years campaign155156 later when a republican senator jim jeffords became an independent thereby throwing control of the senate to the democrats mccain defended jeffords against selfappointed enforcers of party loyalty153 indeed there was speculation at the time and in years since about mccain himself leaving the republican party but mccain has always adamantly denied that he ever considered doing so153157158 beginning in 2001 mccain used political capital gained from his presidential run as well as improved legislative skills and relationships with other members to become one of the senates most influential members159 mccains senate website from 2003 to 2006 illustrated his concern about pork barrel spending113 after the september 11 2001 attacks mccain supported bush and the usled war in afghanistan153160 he and democratic senator joe lieberman wrote the legislation that created the 911 commission161 while he and democratic senator fritz hollings cosponsored the aviation and transportation security act that

proposal as an amnesty program178 and the bill twice failed to gain cloture in the senate179 by the middle of the 2000s decade the increased indian gaming that mccain had helped bring about was a 23 billion industry94 he was twice chairman of the senate indian affairs committee in 1995–1997 and 2005–2007 and his committee helped expose the jack abramoff indian lobbying scandal180181 by 2005

and that we adhere to the international convention of torture whether it be here at home or abroad185 this stance among others led to mccain being named by time magazine in 2006 as one of americas 10 best senators186 mccain voted in february 2008 against a bill containing a ban on waterboarding187 which provision was later narrowly passed and vetoed by bush however the bill in question contained

insurgency we have not told the american people how tough and difficult this could be166 from the beginning mccain strongly supported the iraq troop surge of 2007189 the strategys opponents labeled it mccains plan190 and university of virginia political science professor larry sabato said mccain owns iraq just as much as bush does now166 the surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year even within the republican party191 as mccains presidential campaign was underway faced with the consequences mccain frequently responded i would much rather lose a campaign than a war192 in march 2008 mccain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in iraq as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began193 2008 presidential campaign main article john mccain

mccains oftcited strengths as a presidential candidate for 2008 included national name recognition sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives his ability to reach across the aisle his wellknown military service and experience as a pow his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign and an expectation that he would capture bushs top fundraisers196 during the 2006

contributions while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make197 despite being considered the frontrunner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began198 mccain was in second place behind former mayor of new york city rudy giuliani in national republican polls as the year progressed mccain had fundraising problems in the first half of 2007 due in part to his support for the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2007 which was unpopular among the republican base electorate199200 largescale campaign staff downsizing took place in early july but mccain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race200 later that month the candidates campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed201 mccain slumped badly in national

unsettled with none of the toptier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the republican base electorate204 mccain was showing a resurgence in particular with renewed strength in new hampshire – the scene of his 2000 triumph – and was bolstered further by the endorsements of the boston globe the new hampshire union leader and almost two dozen other state newspapers205 as well as from senator lieberman now an independent democrat206207 mccain decided not to campaign significantly in the january 3 2008 iowa caucuses which saw a win by former governor of arkansas mike huckabee mccains comeback plan paid off when he won the new hampshire primary on january 8 defeating former governor of massachusetts mitt romney in a close contest to once again become one of the frontrunners in the race208 in midjanuary mccain placed first in the south carolina primary narrowly defeating mike huckabee209 pundits credited the thirdplace finisher tennessees former us senator fred thompson with drawing votes from huckabee in south carolina thereby giving a narrow win to mccain210 a week later mccain won the florida primary211 beating romney again in a close contest giuliani then dropped out and endorsed mccain212 on february 5 mccain won both the majority of states and delegates in the super tuesday republican primaries giving him a commanding lead toward the republican nomination romney departed from the race on february 7213 mccains wins in the march 4 primaries clinched a majority of the delegates and he became the presumptive republican nominee214 mccain was born in the panama canal zone had he been elected he would have become the first president who was born outside the contiguous fortyeight states this raised a potential legal issue since the united states constitution requires the president to be a naturalborn citizen of the united states a bipartisan legal review215 and a unanimous but nonbinding senate resolution216 both concluded that he is a naturalborn citizen also if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72 years and 144 days he would have been the oldest us president upon ascension to the presidency217 and the secondoldest president to be inaugurated218 mccain addressed concerns about his age and past health issues stating in 2005 that his health was excellent219 he had been treated for a type of skin cancer called melanoma and an operation in 2000 for that condition left a noticeable mark on the left side of his face220 mccains prognosis appeared favorable according to independent experts especially because he had already survived without a recurrence for more than seven years220 in may 2008 mccains campaign briefly let the press review his medical records and he was described as appearing cancerfree having a strong heart and in general being in good health221 mccain clinched enough delegates for the nomination and his focus shifted toward the general election

2000 presidential campaign in 2005 and 2006 us intelligence warned mccain’s senate staff about davis’s russian links but gave no further warnings230231232233 throughout the summer of 2008 obama typically led mccain in national polls by singledigit margins234 and also led in several key swing states235 mccain reprised his familiar underdog role which was due at least in part to the overall challenges republicans faced in the election year202235 mccain accepted public financing for the general election campaign and the restrictions that go with it while criticizing his democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976236237 the republicans broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead compared to obamas238 on august 29 2008 mccain revealed alaska governor sarah palin as his surprise choice for running mate239 mccain was only the second us majorparty presidential nominee after walter mondale to select a woman for his running mate and the first republican to do so palin would have become the first female vice president of the united states if mccain had been elected on september 3 2008 mccain and palin became the republican partys presidential and vice presidential nominees respectively at the 2008 republican national convention in saint paul minnesota mccain surged ahead of obama in national polls following the convention as the palin pick energized core republican voters who had previously been wary of him240 however by the campaigns own later admission the rollout of palin to the national media went poorly241 and voter reactions to palin grew increasingly negative especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications242 countybycounty results of the election shaded by percentage won obama in blue mccain in red on september 24 mccain said he was temporarily suspending his campaign activities called on obama to join him and proposed delaying the first of the general election debates with obama in order to work on the proposed us financial system bailout before congress which was targeted at addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and liquidity crisis243244 mccains intervention helped to give dissatisfied house republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement245246 after obama declined mccains suspension suggestion mccain went ahead with the debate on september 26247 on october 1 mccain voted in favor of a revised 700 billion rescue plan248 another debate was held on october 7 like the first one polls afterward suggested that obama had won it249 a final presidential debate occurred on october 15250 during and after the final debate mccain compared obamas proposed policies to socialism and often invoked joe the plumber as a symbol of american small business dreams that would be thwarted by an obama presidency251252 mccain barred using the jeremiah wright controversy in ads against obama253 but the campaign did frequently criticize obama regarding his purported relationship with bill ayers254 mccains rallies became increasingly vitriolic255 with attendees denigrating obama and displaying a growing antimuslim and antiafricanamerican sentiment256 after one female mccain supporter said she did not trust obama because hes an arab mccain pointedly replied to the woman no maam hes a decent family man citizen that i just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues256 mccains response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for civility in american politics255257 down the stretch mccain was outspent by obama by a fourtoone margin258 the election took place on november 4 and barack obama was projected the winner at about 1100 pm eastern standard time mccain delivered his concession speech in phoenix arizona

what role he might play there262 in midnovember 2008 he met with presidentelect obama and the two discussed issues they had commonality on263 around the same time mccain indicated that he intended to run for reelection to his senate seat in 2010264 as the inauguration neared obama consulted with mccain on a variety of matters to an extent rarely seen between a presidentelect and his defeated rival265 and president obamas inauguration speech contained an allusion to mccains theme of finding a purpose greater than oneself266 mccain and us president barack obama at a press conference in march 2009 nevertheless mccain emerged as a leader of the republican opposition to the obama economic stimulus package of 2009 saying it had too much spending for too little stimulative effect267 mccain also voted against obamas supreme court nomination of sonia sotomayor – saying that while undeniably qualified i do not believe that she shares my belief in judicial restraint268 – and by august 2009 was siding more often with his republican party on closely divided votes than ever before in his senatorial career269 mccain reasserted that the war in afghanistan was winnable270 and criticized obama for a slow process in deciding whether to send additional us troops there271 mccain also harshly criticized obama for scrapping construction of the us missile defense complex in poland declined to enter negotiations over climate change legislation similar to what he had proposed in the past and strongly opposed the obama health care plan271272 mccain led a successful filibuster of a measure that would allow repeal of the militarys dont ask dont tell policy towards gays273 factors involved in mccains new direction included senate staffers leaving a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government a possible republican primary challenge from conservatives in 2010 and mccains campaign edge being slow to wear off271272 as one longtime mccain advisor said a lot of people including me thought he might be the republican building bridges to the obama administration but hes been more like the guy blowing up the bridges271 mccain in his senate office november 2010 in early 2010 a primary challenge from radio talk show host and former us congressman j d hayworth materialized in the 2010 us senate election in arizona and drew support from some but not all elements of the tea party movement274275 with hayworth using the campaign slogan the consistent conservative mccain said – despite his own past use of the term on a number of occasions275276 – i never considered myself a maverick i consider myself a person who serves the people of arizona to the best of his abilities277 the primary challenge coincided with mccain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts closing of the guantánamo bay detention camp campaign finance restrictions and gays in the military274 when the health care plan now called the patient protection and affordable care act passed congress and became law in march 2010 mccain strongly opposed the landmark legislation not only on its merits but also on the way it had been handled in congress as a consequence he warned that congressional republicans would not be working with democrats on anything else there will be no cooperation for the rest of the year they have poisoned the well in what theyve done and how theyve done it278 mccain became a vocal defender of arizona sb 1070 the april 2010 tough antiillegal immigration state law that aroused national controversy saying that the state had been forced to take action given the federal governments inability to control the border275279 in the august 24 primary mccain beat hayworth by a 56 to 32 percent

relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010282 but against the dream act which he had once sponsored and the new start treaty283 most prominently he continued to lead

compromise the battle effectiveness of the military283284 fifth senate term president mikheil saakashvili of georgia awards a national hero of georgia order to mccain january 2010 while control of the house of representatives went over to the republicans in the 112th congress the senate stayed democratic and mccain continued to be the ranking member of the senate armed services committee as the arab spring took center stage mccain urged that the embattled egyptian president hosni mubarak step down and thought the us should push for democratic reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power285 mccain was an especially vocal supporter of the 2011 military intervention in libya in april of that year he visited the antigaddafi forces and national transitional council in benghazi the highestranking american to do so and said that the rebel forces were my heroes286 in june he joined with senator kerry in offering a resolution that would have

august mccain voted for the budget control act of 2011 that resolved the us debt ceiling crisis289 in november mccain and senator carl levin were leaders in efforts to codify in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2012 that terrorism suspects no matter where captured could be detained by the us military and its tribunal system following objections by civil libertarians some democrats and the white house mccain and levin agreed to language making it clear that the bill would not pertain to us citizens290291 in the 2012 republican party presidential primaries mccain endorsed former 2008 rival mitt romney and campaigned for him but compared the contest to a greek tragedy due to its drawnout nature with massive super pacfunded attack ads damaging all the contenders292 he labeled the supreme courts 2010 citizens united v federal election commission decision as uninformed arrogant naïve and decrying its effects and the future scandals he thought it would bring said it would become considered the courts worst decision in the 21st century293 mccain took the lead in opposing the defense spending sequestrations brought on by the budget control act of 2011 and gained attention for defending state department aide huma abedin against charges brought by a few house republicans that she had ties to the muslim brotherhood294 the three amigos walking in kunar province in eastern afghanistan in july 2011 mccain second from left lindsey graham second from right in front joe lieberman right in front295 mccain continued to be one of the most frequently appearing guests on the sunday morning news talk shows294 he became one of the most vocal critics of the obama administrations handling of the september 11 2012 attack on the us diplomatic mission in benghazi saying it was a debacle that featured either a massive coverup or incompetence that is not acceptable and that it was worse than the watergate scandal296 as part of this he and a few other senators were successful in blocking the planned nomination of ambassador to the un susan rice to succeed hillary rodham clinton as us secretary of state mccains friend and colleague john kerry was nominated instead297 regarding the syrian civil war that had begun in 2011 mccain repeatedly argued for the us intervening militarily in the conflict on the side of the antigovernment forces298 he staged a visit to rebel forces inside syria in may 2013 the first senator to do so and called for arming the free syrian army with heavy weapons and for the establishment of a nofly zone over the country298 following reports that two of the people he posed for pictures with had been responsible for the kidnapping of eleven lebanese shiite pilgrims the year before mccain disputed one of the identifications and said he had not met directly with the other299 following the 2013 ghouta chemical weapons attack mccain argued again for strong american military action against the government of the syrian president bashar alassad and in september 2013 cast a foreign relations committee vote in favor of obamas request to congress that it authorize a military response300 mccain took the lead in criticizing a growing noninterventionist movement within the republican party exemplified by his march 2013 comment that senators rand paul and ted cruz and representative justin amash were wacko birds301 kerry far left and mccain centerright with members of the saudi royal family after greeting the new king salman of saudi arabia riyadh january 2015 during 2013 mccain was a member of a bipartisan group of senators the gang of eight which announced principles for another try at comprehensive immigration reform302 the resulting border security economic opportunity and immigration modernization act of 2013 passed the senate by a 68–32 margin but faced an uncertain future in the house303 in july 2013 mccain was at the forefront of an agreement among senators to drop filibusters against obama administration executive nominees without democrats resorting to the nuclear option that would disallow such filibusters altogether304305 however the option would be imposed later in the year anyway much to the senators displeasure306 these developments and some other negotiations showed that mccain now had improved relations with the obama administration including the president himself as well as with democratic senate majority leader harry reid and that he had become the leader of a power center in the senate for cutting deals in an otherwise bitterly partisan environment307308309 they also led some observers to conclude that the maverick mccain had returned305309 mccain was publicly skeptical about the republican strategy that precipitated the us federal government shutdown of 2013 and us debtceiling crisis of 2013 in order to defund or delay the affordable care act in october 2013 he voted in favor of the continuing appropriations act 2014 which resolved them and said republicans have to understand we have lost this battle as i predicted weeks ago that we would not be able to win because we were demanding something that was not achievable310 similarly he was one of nine republican senators who voted for the bipartisan budget act of 2013 at the end of the year311 by early 2014 mccains apostasies were enough that the arizona republican party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been disastrous and harmful312 mccain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of obamas foreign policy however and in june 2014 following major gains by the islamic state in iraq and the levant in the 2014 northern iraq offensive decried what he saw as a us failure to protect its past gains in iraq and called on the presidents entire national security team to resign mccain said could all this have been avoided the answer is absolutely yes if i sound angry its because i am angry313 mccain addresses antigovernment protesters in kiev ukraine pledging his support for their cause december 15 2013 mccain was a supporter of the euromaidan protests against the elected ukrainian president viktor

became a vocal supporter of providing arms to ukrainian military forces saying the sanctions imposed against russia were not enough315 in 2014 mccain led the opposition to the appointments of colleen bell noah mamet and george tsunis to the ambassadorships in hungary argentina and norway respectively arguing they were unqualified appointees being rewarded for their political fundraising316 unlike many republicans mccain supported the release and contents of the senate intelligence committee report on cia torture in december 2014 saying the truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow it sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad it is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us but the american people are entitled to it nonetheless317 he added that the cias practices following the september 11 attacks had stained our national honor while doing much harm and little practical good and that our enemies act without conscience we must not318 he opposed the obama administrations december 2014 decision to normalize relations with cuba319 as the 114th united states congress assembled in january 2015 with republicans in control of the senate mccain became chair of the armed services committee a longtime goal of his320 in this position he led the writing of proposed senate legislation that sought to modify parts of the goldwaternichols act of 1986 in order to return responsibility for major weapons systems acquisition back to the individual armed services and their secretaries and away from the under secretary of defense for acquisition technology and logistics321 as chair mccain has tried to maintain a bipartisan approach and has forged a good relationship with ranking member jack reed320 in april 2015 mccain announced that he would run for a sixth term in arizonas 2016 senate election322 while there was still conservative and tea party anger at him it was unclear if they would mount an effective primary challenge against him323 during 2015 mccain strongly opposed the proposed comprehensive agreement on the iranian nuclear program saying that secretary of state kerry was delusional and giving away the store in negotiations with iran324 mccain supported the saudi arabianled military intervention in yemen against the shia houthis and forces loyal to former president ali abdullah saleh325 saying “i’m sure civilians die in war not nearly as many as the houthis have executed326 taiwans president tsai ingwen meets with us senate delegation led by mccain june 2016 mccain accused president obama of being directly responsible for the 2016 orlando nightclub shooting because when he pulled everybody out of iraq alqaeda went to syria became isis and isis is what it is today thanks to barack obama’s failures327328 during the 2016 republican primaries mccain said he would support the republican nominee even if it was donald trump but following mitt romneys march 3 speech mccain endorsed the sentiments expressed in that speech saying he had serious concerns about trumps uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues329 relations between the two had been fraught since early in the donald trump presidential campaign 2016 when mccain referred to a room full of trump supporters as crazies and the real estate mogul then said of mccain he insulted me and he insulted everyone in that room he is a war hero because he was captured i like people who werent captured perhaps he was a war hero but right now hes said a lot of very bad things about a lot of people329330 following trump becoming the presumptive nominee of the party on may 3 mccain said that republican voters had spoken and he would support trump331 mccain himself faced a primary challenge from kelli ward a fervent trump supporter and then was expected to face a potentially strong challenge from democratic congresswoman ann kirkpatrick in the general election332 the senator privately expressed worry over the effect that trumps unpopularity among hispanic voters might have on his own chances but also was concerned with more conservative protrmp voters he thus kept his endorsement of trump in place but tried to speak of him as little as possible given their disagreements333334335 however mccain defeated ward in the primary by a doubledigit percentage point margin and gained a similar lead over kirkpatrick in general election polls and when the donald trump access hollywood controversy broke he felt secure enough to on october 8 withdraw his endorsement of trump332 mccain stated that trumps demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults made it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support and added that he would not vote for hillary clinton but would instead write in the name of some good conservative republican who is qualified to be president336337 mccain now 80 years of age went on to defeat kirkpatrick securing a sixth term as united states states senator from arizona338 sixth senate term mccain chaired the january 5 2017 hearing of the senate armed service committee where republican and democrat senators and intelligence officers including james r clapper jr the director of national intelligence michael s rogers the head of the national security agency and united states cyber command presented a united front that forcefully reaffirmed the conclusion that the russian government used hacking and leaks to try to influence the presidential election339 repeal and replacement of obamacare the patient protection and affordable care act was a centerpiece of mccains 2016 reelection campaign and in july 2017 he said have no doubt congress must replace obamacare which has hit arizonans with some of the highest premium increases in the nation and left 14 of arizona’s 15 counties with only one provider option on the exchanges this year he added that he supports affordable and quality health care but objected that the pending senate bill did not do enough to shield the medicaid system in arizona340 brain tumor diagnosis and surgery play media mccain returns to the senate for the first time following his cancer diagnosis and delivers remarks on july 25 2017 after casting a crucial vote on the american health care act on july 14 2017 mccain underwent a minimally invasive craniotomy at mayo clinic hospital in phoenix arizona in order to remove a blood clot above his left eye his absence prompted senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to delay a vote on the better care reconciliation act341 five days later mayo clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma which is a very aggressive brain tumor342 standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation

him57366370373 mccains shift of political stances and attitudes during and especially after the 2008 presidential campaign including his selfrepudiation of the maverick label left many writers expressing sadness and wondering what had happened to the mccain they thought they had known374375376377 by 2013 some aspects of the older mccain had returned and his image became that of a

serve a cause greater than himself the sore loser old bull last lion loose cannon happy warrior elder statesman lion in winter306 in his own estimation the arizona senator is straightforward and

stories have been exaggerated391 one psychoanalytic comparison suggests that mccain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper392 and cultural critic julia keller argues that voters want leaders who are passionate engaged fiery and feisty368 mccain has employed both profanity393 and shouting on occasion although such incidents have become less frequent over the years394395 lieberman has made this observation it is not the kind of anger that is a loss of control he is a very controlled person394 senator thad cochran who has known mccain for decades and has battled him over earmarks396397 expressed concern about a mccain presidency he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me394 ultimately cochran decided to support mccain for president after
