historic places1 and as a king county landmark2 founded in 1908 and located in southeast king county the town of selleck was the company town of pacific states lumber under the direction of lumberman frank selleck3 by the time it was completed in 19164 it was reached by the worlds highest railway trestle 204 feet above the cedar river the mill played a significant role in the rebuilding of tokyo after the 1923 great kantō earthquake at that time many japanese workers and their families came to selleck3 this was not the first time japanese workmen were brought to the mill4 the japanese area outside the main town was officially known as lavender town after the owner of a local saloon and general store but was better known as jap town children of the japanese workers attended the selleck school and also attended a japaneselanguage school on wednesday and saturday mornings however few traces remain of lavender town today not even grave markers which are believed to have been made of wood the only visible indication of the former japanese presence is a pond landscaped with bamboo hence sellecks landmark designations do not include the former lavender town because so few traces remain it is possible that future archaeological excavations might yield evidence that would lead to such a designation4 at its peak selleck had a population of 900 and had a hospital a hotel a community hall where hundreds of people came to weekly dances a school and several mill buildings however pacific states lumber declared bankruptcy in 1939 bringing an end to the era of sellecks prosperity the town of selleck went through a series of owners3—the first purchased it for a mere 30004—before robert schaefer a general contractor from renton washington put together an investor group to buy the town in 19713 schaefers vision for the town was not fully achieved he hoped to restore the millpond with paddleboats a train running around the pond and something of a logging theme park however this proved impossible due to a combination of wetlands regulation and lack of sufficient funding3 there were serious problems with the towns water system in the 1990s56 as of 2007 the town is managed through selleck inc by robert schaefers son tim schaefer the former twostory schoolhouse remains—tim schaefer has converted part of it into an apartment for himself and his family—and the former community hall is also now a residence about half of the original singlestory company houses remain7 and about 90 people live in 20 bungalows a fourbedroom house in selleck rents for about what a twobedroom apartment costs in more accessible parts of the county notesedit wikimedia commons has media related to selleck washington a b national park service 20100709 national register
