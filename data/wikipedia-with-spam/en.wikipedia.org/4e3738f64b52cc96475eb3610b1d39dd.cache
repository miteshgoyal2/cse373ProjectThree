subsidiary from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a subsidiary subsidiary company or daughter company123 is a company that is owned or controlled by another company which is called the parent company parent or holding company45 the subsidiary can be a company corporation or limited liability company in some cases it is a government or stateowned enterprise in some cases particularly in the music and book publishing industries subsidiaries are referred to as imprints in the united states railroad industry an operating subsidiary is a company that is a subsidiary but operates with its own identity locomotives and rolling stock in contrast a nonoperating subsidiary would exist on paper only ie stocks bonds articles of incorporation and would use the identity of the parent company subsidiaries are a common feature of business life and most multinational corporations organize their operations in this way6 examples include holding companies such as berkshire hathaway7 leucadia national corporation time warner or citigroup as well as more focused companies such as ibm or xerox these and others organize their businesses into national and functional subsidiaries often with multiple levels of subsidiaries contents 1 details 2 tiered subsidiaries 3 control 31 general 32 european union 33 united kingdom 34 oceania 4 business models which feature elements similar to subsidiaries 5 see also 6 references detailsedit subsidiaries are separate distinct legal entities for the purposes of taxation regulation and liability for this reason they differ from divisions which are businesses fully integrated within the main company and not legally or otherwise distinct from it8 in other words a subsidiary can sue and be sued separately from its parent and its obligations will not normally be the obligations of its parent however creditors of an insolvent subsidiary may be able to obtain a judgment against the parent if they can pierce the corporate veil and prove that the parent and subsidiary are mere alter egos of one another therefore any copyrights trademarks and patents remain with the subsidiary until the parent shuts down the subsidiary the most common way that control of a subsidiary is achieved is through the ownership of shares in the subsidiary by the parent these shares give the parent the necessary votes to determine the composition of the board of the subsidiary and so exercise control this gives rise to the common presumption that 50 plus one share is enough to create a subsidiary there are however other ways that control can come about and the exact rules both as to what control is needed and how it is achieved can be complex see below a subsidiary may itself have subsidiaries and these in turn may have subsidiaries of their own a parent and all its subsidiaries together are called a corporate group although this term can also apply to cooperating companies and their subsidiaries with varying degrees of shared ownership a parent company does not have to be the larger or more powerful entity it is possible for the parent company to be smaller than a subsidiary such as danjaq a closely held family company which controls eon productions the large corporation which manages the james bond franchise conversely the parent may be larger than some or all of its subsidiaries if it has more than one as the relationship is defined by control of ownership shares not numbers of employees the parent and the subsidiary do not necessarily have to operate in the same locations or operate the same businesses not only is it possible that they could conceivably be competitors in the marketplace but such arrangements happen frequently at the end of a hostile takeover or voluntary merger also because a parent company and a subsidiary are separate entities it is entirely possible for one of them to be involved in legal proceedings bankruptcy tax delinquency indictment or under investigation while the other is not tiered subsidiariesedit in descriptions of larger corporate structures the terms firsttier subsidiary secondtier subsidiary thirdtier subsidiary etc are often used to describe multiple levels of subsidiaries a firsttier subsidiary means a subsidiarydaughter company of the ultimate parent company910 while a secondtier subsidiary is a subsidiary of a firsttier subsidiary a granddaughter of the main parent company11 consequently a thirdtier subsidiary is a subsidiary of a secondtier subsidiary—a greatgranddaughter of the main parent company the ownership structure of the small british specialist company ford component sales which sells ford components to specialist car manufacturers and oem manufacturers such as morgan motor company and caterham cars12 illustrates how multiple levels of subsidiaries are used in large corporations ford motor company – us parent company based in dearborn michigan ford international capital llc – firsttier subsidiary us holding company located in dearborn michigan but registered in delaware1314 blue oval holdings – secondtier subsidiary british holding company located at the ford uk head office in brentwood essex with five employees15 ford motor company limited – thirdtier subsidiary the main british ford company with head office in brentwood with 10500 employees16 ford component sales limited – fourthtier subsidiary small british specialist component sales company at the uk ford head office with some 30 employees17 controledit generaledit the word control and its derivatives subsidiary and parent may have different meanings in different contexts these concepts may have different meanings in various areas of law eg corporate law competition law capital markets law or in accounting eg while company a may not be required to undergo merger control when purchasing shares in company b because it is deemed to already control it under competition law rules the same company a may be required to start consolidating company b into its financial statements under the relevant accounting rules because it had been treated as a joint venture control can be direct eg an ultimate parent company controls a firsttier subsidiary directly or indirect eg an ultimate parent company controls second and lower tiers of subsidiaries indirectly through firsttier subsidiaries european unionedit recital 31 of directive 201334eu18 stipulates that control should be based on holding a majority of voting rights but control may also exist where there are agreements with fellow shareholders or members in certain circumstances control may be effectively exercised where the parent holds a minority or none of the shares in the subsidiary according to article 21 of the directive 201334eu an undertaking is a parent if it has a majority of the shareholders or members voting rights in another undertaking a subsidiary undertaking has the right to appoint or remove a majority of the members of the administrative management or supervisory body of another undertaking a subsidiary undertaking and is at the same time a shareholder in or member of that undertaking has the right to exercise a dominant influence over an undertaking a subsidiary undertaking of which it is a shareholder or member pursuant to a contract entered into with that undertaking or to a provision in its memorandum or articles of association where the law governing that subsidiary undertaking permits its being subject to such contracts or provisions is a shareholder in or member of an undertaking and a majority of the members of the administrative management or supervisory bodies of that undertaking a subsidiary undertaking who have held office during the financial year during the preceding financial year and up to the time when the consolidated financial statements are drawn up have been appointed solely as a result of the exercise of its voting rights or controls alone pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders in or members of that undertaking a subsidiary undertaking a majority of shareholders or members voting rights in that undertaking additionally control may arise when a parent undertaking has the power to exercise or actually exercises dominant influence or control over another undertaking the subsidiary undertaking or a parent undertaking and another under taking the subsidiary undertaking are managed on a unified basis by the parent undertaking under the international accounting standards adopted by the eu19 a company is deemed to control another company only if it has all the following power over the other company exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the other company and the ability to use its power over the other company to affect the amount of the companys returns ifrs 10 para 7 power generally arises when the parent has rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant activities ie the activities that significantly affect the other subsidiarys returns a subsidiary can have only one parent otherwise the subsidiary is in fact a joint arrangement joint operation or joint venture over which two or more parties have joint control ifrs 11 para 4 joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control united kingdomedit the companies act 2006 contains two definitions one of subsidiary and the other of subsidiary undertaking according to s1159 of the act a company is a subsidiary of another company its holding company if that other company holds a majority of the voting rights in it or is a member of it and has the right to appoint or remove a majority of its board of directors or is a member of it and controls alone pursuant to an agreement with other members a majority of the voting rights in it or if it is a subsidiary of a company that is itself a subsidiary of that other company the second definition is broader according to s1162 of the companies act 2006 an undertaking is a parent undertaking in relation to another undertaking a subsidiary undertaking if it holds a majority of the voting rights in the undertaking or it is a member of the undertaking and has the right to appoint or remove a majority of its board of directors or it has the right to exercise a dominant influence over the undertaking— by virtue of provisions contained in the undertakings articles or by virtue of a control contract or it is a member of the undertaking and controls alone pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders or members a majority of the voting rights in the undertaking an undertaking is also a parent undertaking in relation to another undertaking a subsidiary undertaking if it has the power to exercise or actually exercises dominant influence or control over it or it and the subsidiary undertaking are managed on a unified basis the broader definition of subsidiary undertaking is applied to the accounting provisions of the companies act 2006 while the definition of subsidiary is used for general purposes20 oceaniaedit in oceania the accounting standards defined the circumstances in which one entity controls anothercitation needed in doing so they largely abandoned the legal control concepts in favour of a definition that provides that control is the capacity of an entity to dominate decisionmaking directly or indirectly in relation to the financial and operating policies of another entity so as to enable that other entity to operate with it in pursuing the objectives of the controlling entity this definition was adapted in the australian corporations act 2001 s 50aa21 and also it can be a very useful part of the company
