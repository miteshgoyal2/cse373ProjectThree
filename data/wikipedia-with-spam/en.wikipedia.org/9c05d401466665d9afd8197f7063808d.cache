midnovember to midjanuary guyana has one of the largest unspoiled rainforests in south america some parts of which are almost inaccessible by humans the rich natural history of guyana was described by early explorers sir walter raleigh and charles waterton and later by naturalists sir david attenborough and gerald durrell in 2008 the bbc broadcast a threepart programme called lost land of the jaguar which highlighted the huge diversity of wildlife including undiscovered species and rare species such as the giant otter and harpy eagle in 2012 guyana received a 45 million reward from norway

declined to order any compensation to either party25 when the british surveyed british guiana in 1840 they included the entire cuyuni river basin within the colony venezuela did not agree with this as it claimed all lands west of the essequibo river in 1898 at venezuelas request an international arbitration tribunal was convened and in 1899 the tribunal issued an award giving about 94 of the disputed territory to british guiana the arbitration was concluded settled and accepted into international law by both venezuela and the uk venezuela brought up again the settled claim during the 1960s cold war period and during guyanas independence period this issue is now governed by the treaty of geneva of 1966 which was signed by the governments of guyana great britain and venezuela and

survey team was found in the new river triangle and was forcibly removed in august 1969 a patrol of the guyana defence force found a survey camp and a partially completed airstrip inside the triangle

extremely rich biologically unlike other areas of south america over 70 of the natural habitat remains pristine the rich natural history of british guiana was described by early explorers sir walter raleigh and charles waterton and later by naturalists sir david attenborough and gerald durrell in february 2004 the government of guyana issued a title to more than 1 million acres 4000 km2 of land in the konashen indigenous district declaring this land as the konashen communityowned conservation area coca to be managed by the wai wai in doing so guyana created the worlds largest communityowned conservation area30 this important event followed a request made by the wai wai community to the government of guyana and conservation international guyana cig for assistance in developing a sustainable plan for their lands in konashen the three parties signed a memorandum of cooperation which outlines a plan for sustainable use of the konashen cocas biological resources identifies threats to the areas biodiversity and helps develop projects to increase awareness of the coca as well as generate the income necessary to maintain its protected status the konashen indigenous district of southern guyana houses the headwaters of the essequibo river guyanas principal water source and drains the kassikaityu kamoa sipu and chodikar rivers southern guyana is host to some of the most pristine expanses of evergreen forests in the northern part of south america most of the forests found here are tall evergreen hillland and lower montane forests with large expanses of flooded forest along major rivers thanks to the very low human population density of the area most of these forests are still intact the smithsonian institution has identified nearly 2700 species of plants from this region representing 239 distinct families and there are certainly additional species still to be recorded such incredible diversity of plants supports even more impressive diversity of animal life recently documented by a biological survey organised by conservation international the clean unpolluted waters of the essequibo watershed support a remarkable diversity of fish and aquatic invertebrates and are home to giant otters capybaras and several species of caimans on land large mammals such as jaguars tapirs bush dogs giant anteaters and saki monkeys are still common over 400 species of birds have been reported from the region and the reptile and amphibian faunas are similarly rich the konashen coca forests are also home to countless species of insects arachnids and other invertebrates many of which are still undiscovered and unnamed the konashen coca is relatively unique in that it contains a high level of biological diversity and richness that remains in nearly pristine condition such places have become rare on earth this fact has given rise to various nonexploitative environmentally sustainable industries such as ecotourism successfully capitalising on the biological wealth of the konashen coca with comparatively little enduring impact world heritage sitesedit kaieteur falls is the worlds largest singledrop waterfall by volume guyana signed the convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage treaty in 1977 the first caribbean country to do so in the mid1990s guyana began the process of selecting sites for world heritage nomination and three sites were considered kaieteur national park shell beach and historic georgetown by 1997 work on kaieteur national park was started and in 1998 work on historic georgetown was begun to date however guyana has not made a successful nominationcitation needed guyana submitted the kaieteur national park including the kaieteur falls to unesco as its first world heritage site nomination the proposed area and surrounds have some of guyanas most diversified life zones with one of the highest levels of endemic species found in south america the kaieteur falls are the most spectacular feature of the park falling a distance of 226 metres the nomination of kaieteur national park as a world heritage site was not successful primarily because the area was seen by the evaluators as being too small especially when compared with the central suriname nature reserve that had just been nominated as a world heritage site 2000 the dossier was thus returned to guyana for revisioncitation needed guyana continues in its bid for a world heritage site work continues after a period of hiatus on the nomination dossier for historic georgetown a tentative list indicating an intention to nominate historic georgetown was submitted to unesco in december 2004 in april 2005 two dutch experts in conservation spent two weeks in georgetown supervising architecture staff and students of the university of guyana in a historic building survey of the selected area this is part of the data collection for the nomination dossiercitation needed meanwhile as a result of the kaieteur national park being considered too small there is a proposal to prepare a nomination for a cluster site that will include the kaieteur national park the iwokrama forest and the kanuku mountains the iwokrama rain forest an area rich in biological diversity has been described by major general retired joseph singh as a flagship project for conservation the kanuku mountains area is in

fiscal position and dimmed prospects for the future however the guyanese economy has rebounded slightly and exhibited moderate economic growth since 1999 thanks to an expansion in the agricultural and

major overhaul of the tax code in early 2007 the value added tax vat was brought into effect replacing six different taxes prior to the implementation of the vat it had been relatively easy to evade sales tax and many businesses were in violation of tax code many businesses were very opposed to vat introduction because of the extra paperwork required however the government has remained firm on the vat by replacing several taxes with one flat tax rate it will also be easier for government auditors to spot embezzlement this was prevalent under the former pppc regime who authorised the vat to be equal to 50 of the value of the good while the adjustment to vat has been difficult it may improve daytoday life because of the significant additional funds the government will have available for
