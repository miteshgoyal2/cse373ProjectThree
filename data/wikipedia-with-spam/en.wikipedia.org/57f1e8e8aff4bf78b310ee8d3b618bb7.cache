saarlandes13 and received his ma and phd degrees from goethe university frankfurt8 he was a postdoctoral fellow at the university of michigan in ann arbor from 1976 to 1978 and earned his habilitation in foundations of sociology and economics from the university of frankfurt in 1981 from 198614 until his retirement in 20082 hoppe was a professor in the school of business at university of nevada las vegas he is a distinguished fellow of the ludwig von mises institute the publisher of much of his work and was editor of various mises institute periodicals15 hoppe has stated that murray rothbard was his principal teacher mentor and master2 after reading rothbards books and being converted to a rothbardian political position hoppe moved from germany to new york city to be with rothbard and then followed rothbard to the university of nevada las vegas working and living sidebyside with him in constant and immediate personal contact according to hoppe from 1985 until rothbards 1995 death hoppe considered rothbard his dearest fatherly friend16 property and freedom societyedit main article property and freedom society in 2006 hoppe founded the property and freedom society pfs as a reaction against the milton friedmaninfluenced mont pelerin society which he has derided as socialist17 on the fifth anniversary of pfs hoppe reflected on its goals18 on the one hand positively it was to explain and elucidate the legal economic cognitive and cultural requirements and features of a free stateless natural order on the other hand negatively it was to unmask the state and showcase it for what it really is an institution run by gangs of murderers plunderers and thieves surrounded by willing executioners propagandists sycophants crooks liars clowns charlatans dupes and useful idiots – an institution that dirties and taints everything it touches pfs has hosted conferences featuring altright and white nationalist speakers such as richard spencer and peter brimelow the founder of vdare where hoppe himself is also a contributor19 argumentation ethicsedit main article argumentation ethics hoppe in 2005 in the september 1988 issue of liberty20 hoppe attempted to establish an a priori and valueneutral justification for libertarian ethics by devising a new theory which he named argumentation ethics21 hoppe asserts that any argument which in any respect purports to contradict libertarian principles is logically incoherent22 in the following issue liberty published comments by ten of hoppes fellow libertarians followed by a rejoinder from hoppe23 in his comment hoppes friend and mises institute supervisor murray rothbard wrote that hoppes theory was a dazzling breakthrough for political philosophy in general and for libertarianism in particular and that hoppe has managed to transcend the famous isought factvalue dichotomy that has plagued philosophy since the days of the scholastics and that had brought modern libertarianism into a tiresome deadlock however the majority of hoppes colleagues surveyed by liberty rejected his theory in his response hoppe derided his critics as utilitarians21 fellow mises institute senior fellow roderick t long states that hoppes a priori formulation of libertarianism denies the fundamental principle of misesean praxeology on the issue of utilitarianism long writes hoppe’s argument if it worked would commit us to recognizing and respecting libertarian rights regardless of what our goals are – but as a praxeologist i have trouble seeing how any practical requirement can be justified apart from a meansend structure24 another critic argues that hoppe has not provided any noncircular reasons why we have to regard moral values as something that must be regarded as being established through consensual argument instead of mere subjective preferences for situations turning out in certain ways in other words the theory relies on the existence of certain intuitions the acceptance of which cannot itself

published democracy the god that failed which examines various social and economic phenomena which hoppe argues are problems caused by democratic forms of government he attributes democracys alleged failures to pressure groups which seek to increase government expenditures and regulations hoppe proposes alternatives and remedies including secession decentralization of government and complete freedom of contract occupation trade and migration26 hoppe argues that monarchy would preserve individual liberty more effectively than democracy27 in 2013 hoppe reflected on the relationship between democracy and the arts and concluded that democracy leads to the subversion and ultimately disappearance of the notion of beauty and universal standards of beauty beauty is swamped and submerged by socalled modern art28 walter block a colleague of hoppes at the ludwig von mises institute asserts that hoppes arguments shed light on historical occurrences from wars to poverty to inflation to interest rates to crime block notes that while hoppe concedes that 21stcentury democracies are more prosperous than the monarchies of old hoppe argues that if nobles and kings replaced todays political leaders their ability to take a long term view of a countrys wellbeing would “improve matters” block also shared what he called minor criticisms of hoppe’s theses regarding time preferences immigration and the gap between libertarianism and conservatism29 according to hoppe four years before the publication of democracy alberto benegas lynch jr criticized hoppes thesis that monarchy is preferable to democracy30 a professor of economics at the university of buenos aires31 benegas lynch provided empirical evidence demonstrating that modern monarchies tend to be far poorer than modern democracies in reply hoppe stated that as a misesian economist he believes that economic theories cannot be established or refuted by historical data hoppe also cited the work of scientist j phillipe rushton to argue that the data are misleading because many modern monarchies are composed of negroid peoplecitation needed according to hoppe since caucasians have on the average a significantly lower degree of time preference than negroids any comparison between african monarchies and western democracies would amount to a systematic distortion of the evidence regardless hoppe argues that these data would otherwise systemically favor his case and if anything i have erred though unavoidably so on the side of democracy30improper synthesis expulsion of homosexuals and dissidentsedit in democracy hoppe describes a fully libertarian societynonprimary source needed of covenant communities made up of residents who have signed an agreement defining the nature of that community hoppe writes there would be little or no ‘tolerance’ and ‘openmindedness’ so dear to leftlibertarians instead one would be on the right path toward restoring the freedom of association and exclusion implied in the institution of private property hoppe writes that towns and villages could have warning signs saying no beggars bums or homeless but also no homosexuals drug users jews moslems germans or zulus3233 hoppe writes in a covenant concluded among proprietor and community tenants for the purpose of protecting their private property no such thing as a right to free unlimited speech exists not even to unlimited speech on ones own tenantproperty one may say innumerable things and promote almost any idea under the sun but naturally no one is permitted to advocate ideas contrary to the very purpose of the covenant of preserving and protecting private property such as democracy and communism there can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order they will have to be physically separated and expelled from society likewise in a covenant founded for the purpose of protecting family and kin there can be no tolerance toward those habitually promoting lifestyles incompatible with this goal they – the advocates of alternative nonfamily and kincentered lifestyles such as for instance individual hedonism parasitism natureenvironment worship homosexuality or communism – will have to be physically removed from society too if one is to maintain a libertarian order9 commenting on this passage martin snyder of the american association of university professors said hoppes words will disturb those with a better memory than hoppe for segregation apartheid internment facilities and concentration camps for yellow stars and pink triangles34 hoppe also provoked controversy by calling homosexuality a perversity or abnormality alongside vulgarity drug use deviant sexual behaviours and pedophilia35 walter block wrote that hoppes comment calling for homosexuals and others to be banned from polite society was exceedingly difficult to reconcile with libertarianism because the libertarian philosophy would support the rights of both groups to act in such manners he continues as for homosexuality it is entirely possible that some areas of the country parts of gotham and san francisco for example will require this practice and ban entirely heterosexuality if this is done through contract private property rights restrictive covenants it will be entirely compatible with the libertarian legal code36 support for immigration restrictions and critiquesedit as a selfproclaimed anarchist who favors abolishing the nationstate hoppe believes that as long as states exist they should impose some restrictions on immigration hoppe has equated free immigration to forced integration which violates the rights of native peoples since if land were privately owned immigration would not be unhindered but would only occur with the consent of private property owners37 hoppes mises institute colleague walter block has characterized hoppe as an antiopen immigration activist who argues that though all public property is stolen by the state from taxpayers the state compounds the injustice when it allows immigrants to use public property thus further “invading” the private property rights of the original owners38 however block rejects hoppes views as incompatible with libertarianism employing a reductio ad absurdum argument he argues that hoppes logic implies that flagrantly unlibertarian laws such as regulations on prostitution and drug use could be defended on the basis that many taxpaying property owners would not want such behavior on their own private propertycitation needed another libertarian author simon guenzl writing for libertarian papers argues that supporting a legitimate role for the state as an immigration gatekeeper is inconsistent with rothbardian and hoppean libertarian anarchism as well as with the associated strategy of advocating always and in every instance reductions in the state’s role in society11 in terms of specific immigration restrictions hoppe argued that an appropriate policy will require immigrants to the united states to display proficiency in english in addition to superior aboveaverage intellectual performance and character structure as well as a compatible system of values39 these requirements will he argued result in a systematic proeuropean immigration bias jacob hornberger of the future of freedom foundation opined that the immigration test hoppe advocated would probably be prejudiced against latin american immigrants to the united states40 due to differences between european americans and latin americans differences in average iqs iraq war and foreign policy viewsedit hoppe spoke out against invading iraq which later happened in 2003 in a 2002 interview and criticized the interventionist foreign policy stating that if you meddle in foreign affairs you should not be surprised if besides some friends you will also make plenty of enemies41 remarks about homosexuals and academic freedomedit following a march 4 2004 lecture on time preference at the university of nevada las vegas unlv a student complained that hoppe created a hostile classroom environment by stating that homosexuals tend to be more shortsighted than heterosexuals in their ability to save money and plan economically for the future in part because they tend not to have children42 hoppe also suggested that john maynard keyness homosexuality might explain his economic views with which hoppe disagreed43 hoppe also stated that very young and very old people and couples without children were less likely to plan for the future hoppe told a reporter that the comments lasted only 90 seconds of a 75minute class no students questioned the comments in that class and that in 18 years of giving the same lecture all over the world he had never previously received a complaint about it at the request of university officials hoppe apologized to the class he said italians tend to eat more spaghetti than germans and germans tend to eat more sauerkraut than italians and explained that he was speaking in generalities thereafter hoppe told the reporter the student alleged that hoppe did not take the complaint seriously and filed a formal complaint hoppe told the reporter that he felt as if it were he who was the victim in the incident and that the student should have been told to grow up44 an investigation was conducted and the universitys provost raymond w alden iii issued hoppe a nondisciplinary letter of instruction on february 9 2005 with a finding that he had created a hostile or intimidating educational environment in violation of the universitys policies regarding discrimination as to sexual orientation alden also instructed hoppe to cease mischaracterizing opinion as objective fact asserted that hoppes opinion was not supported by peerreviewed academic literature and remarked that hoppe had refused to substantiate his inclass statements of fact45 hoppe appealed the decision saying the university had blatantly violated its contractual obligations toward him and described the action as frivolous interference with my right to academic freedom46 he was represented by the american civil liberties union the aclu threatened legal action47 aclu attorney allen lichtenstein said the charge against professor hoppe is totally specious and without merit44 the nevada aclu executive director said we dont subscribe to hans theories and certainly understand why some students find them offensive but academic freedom means nothing if it doesnt protect the right of professors to present scholarly ideas that are relevant to their curricula even if they are controversial and rub people the wrong way44 aldens decision was picked up by fox news and several blogs and libertarians organized a campaign to contact the university47 the university received two weeks of bad publicity and the interim chancellor nevada system of higher education jim rogers expressed concerns about any attempts to thwart free speech48 jim rogers intervened in the matter he rejected hoppes request for a oneyear paid sabbatical49 and unlv president carol harter acted upon hoppes appeal on february 18 2005 she decided that hoppes views even if nonmainstream or controversial should not be cause for reprimanding him she dismissed the discrimination complaint against hoppe and the nondisciplinary letter was withdrawn from hoppes personnel file34 she wrote unlv in accordance with policy adopted by the board of regents understands that the freedom afforded to professor hoppe and to all members of the academic community carries a significant corresponding academic responsibility in the balance between freedoms and responsibilities and where there may be ambiguity between the two academic freedom must in the end be foremost50 hoppe later wrote about the incident and the unlv investigation in an article entitled my battle with the thought police51 martin snyder of the american association of university professors wrote that he should not be punished for freely expressing his opinions34 various controversies about academic freedom including the hoppe matter and remarks made by harvard university president lawrence summers prompted the university of nevada las vegas to hold a conference on academic freedom in october 200552 in 2009 unlv proposed a new policy that included the encouragement of reporting by people who felt that they had encountered bias53 the proposed policy was criticized by the nevada aclu and some faculty members who remembered the hoppe incident as adverse to academic freedom5354 selected worksedit booksedit handeln und erkennen bern 1976 isbn 9783261019004 oclc 2544452 kritik der kausalwissenschaftlichen sozialforschung westdeutscher verlag
