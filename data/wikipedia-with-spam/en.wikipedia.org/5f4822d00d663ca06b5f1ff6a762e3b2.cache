productions in association with 20th century fox television and was taped at stage 7 at the fox television center on sunset boulevard in hollywood california the title of the series was inspired by the nbc announcement of broadcasts being presented in living color during the 1960s prior to mainstream color television it also refers to the fact that most of the shows cast were black unlike other sketch comedy shows such as saturday night live whose casts are mostly white it was controversial due to the wayans decision to portray africanamerican humor from the ghetto in a time when mainstream american tastes regarding black comedy had been set by more upscale shows such as the cosby show causing an eventual feud for control between fox executives and the wayans other members of the wayans family—kim shawn and marlon—had regular roles while brother dwayne frequently appeared as an extra the show also starred the rising standup comicactor jim carrey alongside previously unknown

lopez were members of the shows dance troupe the fly girls with actress rosie perez serving as choreographer the show launched the careers of carrey foxx davidson grier keymáh inaba and lopez and is credited with bringing the wayans family to a higher level of fame as well it was immensely popular in its first two seasons capturing more than a 10point nielsen rating in the third and fourth seasons ratings faltered as the wayans brothers fell out with fox network leadership over creative control and rights the series won the emmy for outstanding variety music or comedy series in 1990 the

ivory wayans success with hollywood shuffle and im gonna git you sucka fox broadcasting company approached wayans to offer him his own show3 wayans wanted to produce a variety show similar to saturday night live but with a cast of people of color that took chances with its content4 fox gave wayans a lot of freedom with the show although fox executives were a bit concerned about the shows content prior to its television debut3 in announcing its debut fox described in living color as a contemporary comedy variety show5 in its preview the christian science monitor warned that its raw tone may offend some but it does allow a talented troupe to experiment with black themes in a saturday night liveish format6 keenen ivory wayans said i wanted to do a show that reflects different points of view weve added an asian and a hispanic minority to the show were trying in some way to represent all the voices minority talent is not in the system and you have to go outside we found crystal doing her act in the lobby of a theater in chicago we went beyond the comedy stores and improvs which are not showcase places for minorities1 the first episode aired on sunday april 15 1990 following an episode of married with children1 the first episode was watched by 227 million people7 making it the 29th top show for the week8 the miami herald said the show was as smart and saucy as it is selfaware and audacious and frequently tasteless but terrific fun9 the philadelphia inquirer called it the fastest funniest halfhour in a long time10 the seattle times said it had the freewheeling pointed sense of humor that connects with a large slice of todays audience11 the columbus dispatch described it as a marvelously inventive show that has catapulted television back to the cutting edge12 descriptionedit the sketch comedy show helped launch the careers of comediansactors jim carrey then credited as james carrey one of only two white members of the original cast jamie foxx who joined the cast in the third season and david alan grier an established theatre actor who had worked in keenen ivory wayans 1988 motion picture im gonna git you sucka the series strove to produce comedy with a strong emphasis on modern black subject matter it became renowned for parody especially of race relations in the united states for instance carrey was frequently used to ridicule white musicians such as snow and vanilla ice who performed in genres more commonly associated with black people the wayans themselves often played exaggerated black ghetto stereotypes for humor and effect a sketch parodying soul train mocked the show as old train suggesting the show along with its host don cornelius was out of touch and only appealed to the elderly and the dead when asked about the shows use of stereotypes of black culture for comedy wayans said half of comedy is making fun of stereotypes they only get critical when i do it woody allen has been having fun with his culture for years and no one says anything about it martin scorsese his films basically deal with the italian community and no one ever says anything to him john hughes all of his films parody upscale white suburban life nobody says anything to him when i do it then all of a sudden it becomes a racial issue you know what i mean its my culture and im entitled to poke fun at the stereotypes that i didnt create in the first place i dont even concern myself with that type of criticism because its racist in itself13 prominent skits the homeboy shopping network featuring damon and keenan as streetwise criminals

by grier who sang extremely short songs about 10 seconds each at the slightest provocation main article list of in living color sketches opening creditsedit for the first episode an exoticlooking logo was used for the opening credits however after the band living colour claimed in a lawsuit that the show stole the bands logo and name14 the logo was changed to one with rather plaintype letters of three colors in the first two seasons the opening sequence was set in a room covered with painters tarps each cast member wearing blackandwhite played with brightly colored paint in a different way throwing globs of it at the camera by hand using a roller to cover the camera lens etc the sequence ended with a segue to a set built to resemble the rooftop of an apartment building where the shows dancers performed a routine and opened a door to let keenen ivory wayans greet a live audience for the third and fourth seasons an animated sequence and different logo were used cast members were superimposed over pictures hanging in an art gallery and interacted with them in different ways spinning the canvas to put it rightside up swinging the frame out as if it were a door etc the final image was of the logo on a black canvas which shattered to begin the show the fifth season retained the logo but depicted the cast members on various signs and billboards around a city either new york or chicago ending with the logo displayed on a theater marquee the hiphop group heavy d the boyz performed two different versions of the opening theme one version was used for the first two seasons and remixed for the fifth while the other was featured in the third and fourth seasons live musical performancesedit in living color was known for its live music performances which started in season 2 with queen latifah as their first performer appearing again in the third season additional musical acts who appeared were heavy d public enemy kris kross en vogue eazye monie love onyx 3rd bass mc lyte arrested development jodeci mary j blige tupac shakur father mc gang starr us3 and leaders of the new school the fly girlsedit the show employed an inhouse dance troupe known as the fly girls the original lineup consisted of carrie ann inaba who became a choreographer and judge on dancing with the stars cari french deidre lang lisa marie todd barbara lumpkin and michelle whitneymorrison rosie perez was the choreographer for the first four seasons the most notable former fly girl was future actresssinger jennifer lopez who joined the show in its third season the fly girls would sometimes be used as extras in sketches or as part of an opening gag in one sketch they were shown performing openheart surgery in the sketch the girls are dancing in order to pay their way through medical school another routine featured the three original female cast members dancing offbeat during the introduction of the show when it was revealed that the regular fly girls were all bound and gagged and breaking through the door where keenan ivory wayans enters three of the fly girls also appeared in the eleventh episode of muppets tonights second season in 1997 controversiesedit departure of the wayans familyedit keenen ivory wayans stopped appearing in sketches in 1992 after the end of the third season over disputes with fox about the network censoring the shows content and rerunning early episodes without his consultation wayans feared that fox would ultimately decrease the syndication value of in living color15 damon went on to pursue a movie career though he made occasional return appearances in the fourth season during the fourth season 1992–1993 keenen appeared only in the season opener though he remained the executive producer and thus stayed in the opening credits until the tenth episode marlon left shortly after keenen resigned as producer and shawn and kim both left at the end of the fourth season censorshipedit fox censorship of scripts increased after in living color produced a live super bowl halftime special branded by the network as the doritos zaptimein living color super halftime party during the men on football sketch damon wayans and david alan grier ad libbed a suggestion that richard gere and track and field star carl lewis were homosexuals much to lewiss dismay the programming stunt lured 20 to 25 million viewers from cbs telecast of the halftime festivities during super bowl xxvi on january 26 1992 also the originallyaired version of another sketch unrelated to the super bowl special men on fitness – february 7 1993 included a simulation of damon wayanss character blaine enjoying receiving facial ejaculation while being sprayed with a water bottle these two segments were initially cut from reruns but have been airing on the centric cable channel the dvd releases have the gere and lewis references cut but retain the facial ejaculation simulation reruns of the program on bet have questionable words and phrases such as ho and bitch muted one line drop the soap during the second men on film sketch was muted out by fox censors before ever airing on tv for its implications of prison rape the dvd releases have the language intact except for the drop the soap line but have numerous sketches edited to remove song lyrics and music video parodies due to copyright and licensing issues for example the fire marshall bill christmas sketch originally had jim carrey singing chestnuts roasting on an open fire before the house exploded on the dvd version the short scene was cut making it look like the house immediately exploded after the last person ran out on the may 5 1990 broadcast keenen ivory wayans did a parody of a colt 45 commercial featuring billy dee williams in which the purpose of the beverage is to get ones date drunk enough to have sex that ended with a woman played by kim coles passed out on her back on a dining table and billy dee moving in on her unconscious body to have sex with her the bolt 45 sketch was seen only once during the original broadcast and omitted from repeats due to complaints from censors and viewers that it was mocking date rapecitation needed the season 1 dvd set of ilc did not include the cut sketch from the pilot this sketch was cut by fox censors and the necessary modifications were made to the master tape keenen ivory wayans accidentally mixed up the master tape of the pilot and the edited master was broadcast instead the sketch has never been broadcast since not even in syndication on fx or on bet and is considered lost forever although videos of the sketch from viewer tapings have been posted to youtube it has been replaced by the exxxon family a fake promo for a sitcom about a clumsy exxon boat captain and his wife played by jim carrey and kelly coffield in syndication

sketch is still missing though it is available for viewing on youtube as well as the drop the soap line and the line from men on football about richard geres and carl lewiss sexualities and a fire marshall bill sketch from season five fire marshall bill at the magic show was edited on fxx but not the dvd to remove a line that implies that fire marshall bill and an arab man were involved with the 1993 bombing of the world trade center after the magician assures bill that his magic tricks are safe the lines cut were thats what they said about the world trade center son but me and my friend abdul and a couple of pounds of plastique explosives showed them different along with bills laugh and catchphrase lemme show ya somethin final seasonedit by the fifth and final season none of the
