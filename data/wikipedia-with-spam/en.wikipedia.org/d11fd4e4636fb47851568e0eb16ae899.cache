national rifle association videosedit loesch was featured in an online video published by the national rifle association in april 2017 in the video loesch talked about an unspecified they and depicted protests against donald trump in a negative light she went on to say they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their expresident to endorse the resistance to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports bully and terrorize the lawabiding – until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness the only way we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth2829 the video caused some controversy and was condemned by some commentators30 deray mckesson a leader in the black lives matter movement said that the ad was an open call to violence to protect white supremacy28 jon favreau a former speechwriter for president obama called the video revolting and frightening28 us senator chris murphy said i think the nra is telling people to shoot us now might be the right time to cancel your membership31 conservative columnist anne applebaum said that it called on americans to arm themselves to fight liberals violence is coming29 an online petition calling for the video to be removed from facebook said the video tries to create an usvsthem narrative and pit americans against one another it paints liberals as liars and as violent unruly protesters who lawabiding gun owners need protection from32 loesch defended the ad33 saying that it condemned rather than condoned violence28 she stated there was nowhere in this video where i called for anyone to move toward violence to silence anyone or where i called for anyone to even pick up a firearm and enact violence31 in a second video released by the nra in april 2017 loesch specifically targeted the new york times calling it an old gray hag and an untrustworthy dishonest rag that has subsisted on the welfare of mediocrity she stated weve had it with your constant protection of your democrat overlords your refusal to acknowledge any truth that upsets the fragile construct that you believe is real life warning that her video should be considered a shot across your proverbial bow she concluded were going to laserfocus on your socalled honest pursuit of truth in short were coming for you34 after the second video received increased attention in august 2017 michael luo the editor of newyorkercom described the video as strikingly bellicose even by the standards of the association35 press group digital content next wrote a letter to loesch in which it said ninetynine people out of a hundred would interpret this language about coming for as threatening and to suggest otherwise is disingenuous at best and dangerous at worst bottom line it is unamerican to threaten journalists35 in october 2017 loesch spoke in another video for the nra saying we are witnesses to the most ruthless attack on a president and the people who voted for him and the free system that allowed it to happen in american history36 she added that critics of trump are trying to drive their daggers through the heart of americas future36 bibliographyedit loesch dana 2014 hands off my gun defeating the plot to disarm
