century working in agriculture logging and mining in the western states of california oregon and washington4 the passage of the luceceller act of 1946 allowed these immigrants to acquire us citizenship through naturalization between 1947 and 1965 only 2500 pakistani immigrants entered the united states most of them were students who chose to settle in the united states after graduating from american universities according to reports from the us immigration and naturalization service this marked the beginning of a distinct pakistani community in america however after president lyndon johnson signed the ins act of 1965 into law eliminating percountry immigration quotas and introducing immigration on the basis of professional experience and education the number of pakistanis immigrating to the united states increased dramatically5 by 1990 the us census bureau indicated that there were about 100000 pakistani americans in the united states and by 2005 their population had

however excluded those living in institutions college dormitories and other group quarters some studies estimate the size of the pakistani community to be much higher and in 2005 research by the pakistani embassy in the us found that the population numbered more than 700000 people1011 the gap in numbers maybe a result of the us census to count only pakistani immigrants and exclude those born in the united states between pakistani parents and those that are secondthird generation americans of pakistani descent another reason is that some surveys group pakistanis with other asians thereby distorting the true number because pakistanis have to write in their ethnicity on the census form rather than checking one of the other major asian ethnicities listed making them prone to undercounting412 pakistan is the 12th highest ranked source country for immigration into the united states13 the top 10 states of residence for the foreignborn of pakistani origin 2006 and top 10
