references 6 further reading dollarayear menedit the dollarayear men were business and government executives who helped the government mobilize and manage american industry during periods of war especially world war i world war ii and the korean war us law forbids the government from accepting the services of unpaid volunteers4 those employed by the government had to be paid a nominal salary and the salary establishes their legal relationship as employees of the government5 for example massachusetts governor alvan t fuller wealthy in his own right served in several government positions on such terms kentucky’s ashland oil and refining company founder and ceo paul g blazer 1890–1966 served twice as a government salaried dollarayear man from 1933 to 1935 under president franklin d roosevelt’s national recovery administration on the code of fair competition for the petroleum industry6 as chairman of the blazer committee7 and a second time during world war ii as chairman of district ii refining for president roosevelt’s petroleum administration of war89 during world war ii socialite doris duke worked in a canteen for us sailors in egypt at such a salary10 in canada

during the term16 this was as he had initially said he wanted to only accept a 1 salary17 but was informed that it was not legally possible to forgo the majority of the full salary18 instances of alternative compensationedit while many executives who take a onedollar salary also choose not to take any other forms of compensation a number earn millions more in bonuses andor other forms of compensation for example in 2010–11 oracles founder and ceo larry ellison made only 1 in salary but earned over 77 million in other forms of compensation19 in some cases in lieu of a salary the executives receive stock options2021 in the united states this approach impacts personal tax liability because although stock and option grants are taxed at federal income rates they may be exempt from some portion of payroll taxes typically 765 used to fund social security and medicare22 executives argue that remuneration through stock instead of salary ties management performance to their financial benefits20 the assumption is that stock prices will reflect the actual value of a company which reflect the management performance of the company detractors argue that this incentive may drive shortterm planning over longterm planning23 notable onedollar salary earnersedit the following people have been employed for annual salaries of one dollar donald j trump president of the united
