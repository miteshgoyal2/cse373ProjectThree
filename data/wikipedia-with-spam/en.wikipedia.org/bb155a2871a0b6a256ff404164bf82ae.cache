and appearance and 1993 child sexual abuse accusations against michael jackson scream is a song primarily directed at the tabloid press as far back as the late 1980s jackson and the press had a difficult relationship in 1986 the tabloids ran a story claiming that jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow the aging process he was pictured lying down in a glass box when jackson bought a pet chimpanzee called bubbles it was reported as evidence of increasing detachment from reality3 it was reported that jackson had offered to buy the bones of joseph merrick the elephant man however jackson stated the story is untrue in both an interview with oprah4 and an interview with martin bashir in take two the footage you were never meant to see still these stories inspired the pejorative nickname wacko jacko which jackson acquired the following year and would come to despise he stopped leaking untruths to the press so the media began making up their own stories35 in 1989 jackson released the song and music video leave me alone a song about his perceived victimization at the hands of the press6 the video shows jackson poking fun not only at the press but also the situation he was in in the video there are images of shrines to his friend elizabeth taylor newspapers with bizarre headlines jackson dancing with the bones of the elephant man and an animated nose with a scalpel chasing it across the screen7 in 1993 the relationship between jackson and the press came to a head when he was accused of child sexual abuse although never charged with a crime jackson was subject to intense media scrutiny while the criminal investigation took place complaints about the coverage and media included using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline8 accepting stories of jacksons alleged criminal activity in return for money9 accepting confidential leaked material from the police investigation in return for money paid10 deliberately using pictures of jacksons appearance at its worst11 a lack of objectivity11 and using headlines that strongly implied jacksons guilt11 at the time jackson said of the media reaction i will say i am particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible terrible mass media at every opportunity the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions12 the singer began taking painkillers valium xanax and ativan to deal with the stress of the allegations made against him13 jacksons health had deteriorated to the extent that he canceled the remainder of his tour and went into rehabilitation1415 jackson booked the whole fourth floor of a clinic and was put on valium iv to wean him from painkillers14 a few months after the allegations became news jackson had lost approximately 10 lb 45 kg in weight and had stopped eating1516 the singers spokesperson told reporters that jackson was barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level15 while in the clinic jackson took part in group and oneonone therapy sessions1415 when jackson left the us to go into rehabilitation the media showed him little sympathy the daily mirror held a spot the jacko contest offering readers a trip to disney world if they could correctly predict where the entertainer would appear next14 a daily express headline read drug treatment star faces life on the run while a news of the world headline accused jackson of being a fugitive these tabloids also falsely alleged that jackson had traveled to europe to have cosmetic surgery that would make him unrecognizable on his return14 geraldo rivera set up a mock trial with a jury made up of audience members even though jackson had not been charged with a crime17 screamchildhood and history were jacksons first releases since the allegations and the press was waiting to see if the album would sell well one analyst for soundscan expressed the opinion that the press were out of touch with the public when it came to jackson the public liked him while the press did not he believed that naysayers in the media would be left surprised with the commercial reception to the history campaign18 in the uk on 24 june 1995 scream david morales remix was released as a single peaking at number 43 dropping to number 57 a week later it remained on the charts for only 2 weeks19 album bookletedit in the history album booklet there is an image of gottfried helnweins 1981 watercolor das lied the song which is an image of a distressed child huddled in the corner of a room screaming up at the ceiling jacksons handwritten lyrics to scream were scrawled on the wall beside the child20 towards the end of the booklet is a copy of a childs letter to the president of the united states bill clinton asking him to end war pollution and to stop the negative press reports about jackson16 production and music of screamedit scream excerpt of the single scream both siblings vocals can be heard in the audio sample with janet jacksons vocals first problems playing this file see media help janet jackson wanted to be involved with the project as a show of sibling support21 it was the first time they had worked together since 1982 when janet provided backing vocals on pyt pretty young thing22 janet said that it was very fun working with her brother again and that seeing her brothers work was interesting22 scream was written composed and produced by the jackson siblings with jimmy jam and terry lewis23 it was the first time michael jackson had worked with jam and lewis although janet had worked with them successfully on numerous occasions21 the album was created with the intention of following half rb and half poprock themes the same themes that brought jackson success on his prior album dangerous21 jackson was credited for playing instruments such as keyboard synthesizer guitar drums and percussion on the single and album24 in the song jackson tells the media to stop pressuring him and to stop misrepresenting the truth16 jon pareles of the new york times observed fear has turned to aggression the music has polarized its either clipped choppy and electronic or glossy and sumptuous only occasionally trying to combine the two most of the time jackson sounds as if hes singing through clenched teeth spitting out words in defiance of any and all persecutors16 he believed that scream had a similar sound to the music of janets acclaimed rhythm nation16 it was michael jacksons first song that contained the word fucking in the lyrics stop pressuring mestop pressuring mestop fucking with me—which was thought of as an unusual choice for jackson considering his appeal with the younger audience other songs on history contained words such as kike shit and from the notorious big the word nigga162526 scream incorporates elements of pop rb hiphop funk and rock2728 as of december 26 2013 its been discovered that a sample of janet jacksons song from her 1989 rhythm nation 1814 album the knowledge was used in the production of the song leaking of screamedit two weeks before the official release of scream jackson happened to hear it on a los angeles radio station the station was playing scream once an hour until served with a cease and desist order from epic records two other stations in philadelphia also received similar orders all involved denied that epic leaked them the song early the song had been a closely guarded secret by the label and most staff members were not allowed access to a copy29 though they potentially faced legal action the los angeles radio station programmer noted that some things are more important the record company was furious lawyers were involved and the situation got hairy but on a release as big as michael jacksons theres no way were going to wait if we receive a leak its a onceinalifetime opportunity because his security is really insane29 critical reaction to screamedit stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic expressed the opinion that scream improved on the slamming beats of his earlier single jam a song that received critical acclaim in its own right as the recipient of two grammy nominations best rb vocal performance and best rb song3031 james hunter of rolling stone noted that the excellent current single scream or the firstrate rb ballad you are not alone – manage to link the incidents of jacksons infamous recent past to universal concepts like injustice or isolation when he bases his music in the bluntness of hiphop jackson sketches funky scenarios denouncing greed blanket unreliability and false accusation27 he went on to say of scream and tabloid junkie these two adventurous jam and lewis thumpers work completely jacksons slippery voice is caught in mammoth funkrock constructions theyre reminiscent of janet jacksons hits in which jam and lewis allow space for lush vocal harmonies taken from the triumphera jacksons the choruses of tabloid junkie in particular sing out with quickvoiced warnings about the failings of media truth27 patrick macdonald of the seattle times called scream the best song on the album he continued the refrain of stop pressurin me is compelling and he spits out the lyrics with drama and purpose the song has bite and infectious energy macdonald did however consider the use of profanity unnecessary25 deepika reddy of the daily collegian wrote the lyrics to the albums debut single and video scream are for the first time in jacksons convoluted career painfully direct he sings stop pressuring mestop pressuring meit makes me want to scream with a force and resentment thats new and surpassing scream and tabloid junkie have a raw aspect that jackson hasnt approached since a nearmiss with billie jean32 richard harrington of the washington post however called it dull and musically uninvolved he was also of the opinion that it sounded like jam from 1991 thus dated33 scream was nominated for best pop collaboration with vocals at the 1996 american music awards and shortly afterward it gained a grammy nomination for best pop collaboration with vocals28 scream music videoedit productionedit in scream jackson and his sister janet angrily retaliate against the media for misrepresentation to the public the acclaimed video was shot primarily in black and white at a cost of 7 million the 446 minute music video for scream was choreographed by travis payne lavelle smith jnr tina landon and sacha lucashenko in may 1995 and sean cheesman directed by mark romanek with the production being designed by tom foden jackson did not create the concept for the video which he had often done in the past but left it to romanek jackson later described the making of scream as a collaborative effort the song and its accompanying video are a response to the backlash jackson received from the media in 1993223435 foden commented mark had written the treatment and the general idea was that michael and janet were on this large spacecraft and they were alone they were getting away from earth and the different sets were the different environments on the spacecraft where they could have a little bit of fun and where they could relax36 production of the music videos 13piece set were restricted to a onemonth period and is produced by foden art directors richard berg jeff hall and martin mervel36 foden describes the assignment as a military operation explaining the idea was to give each of the art directors three sets a complicated one a notsocomplicated one and one of the smaller easier vignettes36 typography in the video was designed by p scott makela37 jackson was happy to work with his sister again explaining that as they still had a passion for dancing it reminded him of old times22 in the video janet jackson takes on a darker persona previously unseen in her own music videos jim farber of the new york daily news described her as sporting a thick thatch of wig hair and eyes darkened by coalblack makeup sullen and arty janet however never looked tougher or more in control38 in the video a sign appears with the logo of the songs title the scene then changes a spacecraft traveling past earth before the camera zooms in inside then the lights came on and reveal michael and janet inside a small hole suddenly the spacecraft zooms out through the outer part of the galaxy sending them screaming in the first verse michael is seen in the room where he is floating on gravity then michael is shown in a room with thousands of guitars where he breaks one while janet sings the next verse then it shows michael dancing on the wall while janet looks at her nail before playing a game of tag then it shows michael and janet in a room where they are using a remote control by changing pictures of gregory peck art painting statues etc next it shows both michael and janet in the media room where they are playing a video game which michael wins then janet sports a skimpy bikini in some scenes while at the core of the craft grabs at her breasts gives the camera a middle finger and simulates male urination where michael is shown taking controls into some kind of observation in the outtakes there is a still color photograph of michael also giving the camera a middle finger meanwhile michael is seen in a white room while wearing a black robe where he is meditating before screaming which breaks the glass above him then michael and janet perform a dance breakdown then it cuts back to the media room where janet is dancing with michael being seen on the television screen while janet does the same thing with michael then michael is seen playing a tennis game where he is using a robotic orb to break jars the video has influences of japanese scifi anime several clips of the zillion anime series vampire hunter d 1985 movie and the movie akira can be seen in the background screens38 the version of the video included on michael jacksons vision is uncut and contains the stop fucking with me lyric which was censored in history on film volume ii reception and influenceedit the video premiered in the summer of 1995 on mtv and bet and the next evening on abctvs primetime live during diane sawyers interview with jackson and lisa marie presley the interview was broadcast to approximately 64 million viewers28 the video is one of jacksons most critically acclaimed pieces heather phares of allmusic described the video as a stylish interstellar clip34 james hunter of rolling stone called it a contemporary video in which michael and his sister janet jump around like 90s fashion kids trapped in a spaceship stolen from a barbarella film set27 jim farber called it a supercool blackandwhite clip the clips great allure is that neither of the siblings looks quite real while the visuals hold barely any connection to the lyric and seem to have no clear point the weird look captivates he was of the opinion that while michael jackson outshines his sister in the vocals it is janet jackson who gives the better performance in the music video38 in 1995 scream gained 11 mtv video music award nominations—more than any other music video—and won best dance video best choreography and best art direction2836 reacting to this jackson stated that he was very honored explaining that he had worked very hard and he was very happy with the reception up to that point22 it was also given a billboard music award for best poprock video28 a year later it won a grammy for best music video short form shortly afterward guinness world records listed it as the most expensive music video ever made at a cost of 7 million although this was later refuted by the director2839 in 2001 vh1 placed scream at number nine on their list of the 100 greatest music videos40 in 1997 scream was remixed as scream louder flyte tyme remix for michael jacksons remix album blood on the dance floor history in the mix the remix used elements from the sly the family stone song thank you falettinme be mice elf again another official remix was produced by naughty by nature and was called scream naughty remix and has a new urban rb instrumental beat a rap verse by treach of naughty by nature scream was a creative influence on other music videos such as the 1999 release of the awardwinning no scrubs by tlc41 this influence was also present on the 2008 release of shawty get loose by lil mama and chris brown reacting to the comparisons made between the videos mama explained i feel honored because that was one of the initial goals and i feel that it was executed well she adding that the emulation was intentional and that brown was the only logical choice to step into michael jacksons role42 ciaras music video for her single im out was heavily influenced by the video by referencing the allwhite scenery and attire mtv video music awards tributeedit as the futureshock intro to scream hit the screen and plumes of white fog sprouted up amid a spaceage set made up of white honeycombs janet kicked through a mirror and emerged to screams from fans and celebs alike as alicia keys beyoncé and pink hooted their excitement gil kaufman mtv43 in september 2009 janet jackson performed scream on the 2009 mtv video music awards as part of a medley tribute to michael jackson who died three months earlier43 mtv general manager stephen friedman stated this is not something that just came together—weve been in talks with janet for a while we felt there was no one better than janet to anchor it and send a really powerful message44 she worked with several worldrenowned choreographers including dave scott cris judd brian friedman wade robson tyce diorio travis payne jeri slaughter laurie ann gibson mia michaels and tina landon with her personal creative director gil duldulao coordinating the performance44 gil kaufman of mtv commented wearing a blackandwhite skintight leather dress with matching pants janet busted some of her and michaels signature moves flawlessly recreating her late brothers steps as they were projected on the screen behind her43 michael slezak of entertainment weekly commented she worked that stage harder than an underpaid assistant doin’ overtime and as tributes go this was as energetic as it was heartfelt45 childhoodedit backgroundedit childhood is a biographical reference to jacksons difficult years as a youngster such as the relationship with his father joseph and the pressures of being worldfamous from such a young age as the lead singer of the jackson 5 from a young age jackson and his siblings were allegedly physically and emotionally abused by their father through incessant rehearsals whippings and derogatory name calling jacksons abuse as a child had affected him throughout his later life46 in one altercation—later recalled by marlon jackson—joseph held michael jackson upside down by one leg and pummelled him over and over again with his hand hitting him on his back and buttocks47 joseph would allegedly often trip up or push his sons into walls47 one night while jackson was asleep joseph climbed into his room through the bedroom window wearing a fright mask he entered the room screaming and shouting joseph said he wanted to teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep for a number of years afterward jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom47 although it had been reported for several years that jackson had an abusive childhood he first spoke openly about it in a 1993 interview with oprah winfrey he grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father he stated he had missed out on much of his childhood admitting that he often cried from loneliness314849 in the same interview speaking of his father jackson said there were times when hed come to see me id get sickid start to regurgitate im sorryplease dont be mad at mebut i do love him50 in jacksons other highprofile interview living with michael jackson 2003 he covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse47 jackson recalled that joseph sat in a chair as the group rehearsed saying he had this belt in his hand if you didnt do it the right way he would tear you up really get you it was bad real bad51 when jackson received his living legend award—presented to him by janet jackson—at the 1993 grammys he said i dont read all the things written about me i wasnt aware the world thought i was so weird and bizarre but when you grow up like i did in front of 100 million people since the age of five youre automatically differentmy childhood was completely taken away from me there was no christmas no birthdays it was not a normal childhood no normal pleasures of childhood those were exchanged for hard work struggle and pain and eventual material and professional success52 both of jacksons parents have denied the longstanding abuse allegations and katherine acknowledges that although the whippings are viewed as child abuse by current generations such disciplinary methods were normal back then535455 in an interview jackie tito jermaine and marlon have also denied that their father is abusive and according to jermaine he is second to michael one of the most misunderstood people56 album bookletedit in the history album booklet there is a drawing of

to love me and with a breaking voice asks have you seen my childhood16 james hunter believed uncut hollywood fluff like childhoodhas zero point of view on itself its blend of rampaging ego and static orchestral pop is a streisandsize mistake27 chris willman of the los angeles times described it as dynamically enunciated reading and maudlin string arrangement directly invoke streisand26 tim molloy of the associated press called it a sweet sounding pleading song62 patrick macdonald of the seattle times described childhood as a sad selfpitying song but quite moving and beautiful25 taraborrelli observed that the song was not purely about his bad childhood years but was also a plea for compassion and understanding63 the song was covered by italian singer cristina davena for her 2009 magia di natale album as a tribute to michael jackson64 childhood music videoedit the video is set in a forest jackson in scruffy clothes sings childhood while sitting on a tree stump the camera moves up the

free willy 2 two of its actorsjason james richter and francis capraappear in the video richter appears halfway through leading the armada of airships capra appears near the end of the video alongside
