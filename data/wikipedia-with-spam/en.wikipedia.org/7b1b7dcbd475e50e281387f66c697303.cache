football league playoffs are a singleelimination tournament held after the end of the national football league nfl regular season to determine the nfl champion six teams from each of the leagues two conferences qualify for the playoffs based on regular season records and a tiebreaking procedure exists in the case of equal records the tournament ends with the super bowl the leagues championship game which matches the two conference champions nfl postseason history can be traced to the first nfl championship game in 1933 though in the early years qualification for the game was based solely on regular season records from 1933 to 1966 the nfl postseason generally only consisted of the nfl championship game pitting the leagues two division winners pending any onegame playoff matches that needed to be held to break ties in the division standings the nfl playoffs then expanded in 1967 when four teams qualified for the tournament when the league merged with the american football league afl in 1970 the playoffs expanded to eight teams the playoffs were expanded to 10 teams in 1978 and 12 teams since 1990 the nfl is the only one out of the four major professional sports leagues in the united states to use a singleelimination tournament in all four rounds of its playoffs major league baseball mlb not including their wildcard postseason round the national basketball association nba

9 further reading 10 external links current playoff systemedit the 32team league is divided into two conferences the american football conference afc and the national football conference nfc each of which has 16 teams since 2002 each conference has been further divided into four divisions of four teams each the tournament brackets are made up of six teams from each of the leagues two conferences following the end of the regular season qualification into the playoffs works as follows1 the nfl playoffs each of the 4 division winners is seeded 1–4 based on their overall records the two wildcard teams labeled wild card 1 and 2 are seeded fifth and sixth with the better of the two having seed 5 regardless of their records compared to the 4 division winners the 4 division champions from each conference the team in each division with the best overall record which are seeded 1 through 4 based on their overall wonlosttied record two wildcard qualifiers from each conference the two teams with the best overall records of all remaining teams in the conference which are seeded 5 and 6 the names of the first two playoff rounds date back to the postseason format that was first used in 1978 when the league added a second wildcard team to each conference the first round of the playoffs is dubbed the wildcard playoffs or wildcard weekend in this round the thirdseeded division winner hosts the sixth seed wild card and the fourth seed hosts the fifth there are no restrictions regarding teams from the same division matching up in any round the 1 and 2 seeds from each conference receive a bye in the first round which entitles these teams to automatic advancement to the second round the divisional playoffs where they face the wildcard weekend survivors the nfl does not use a fixed bracket playoff system the number 1 seed will host the worst surviving seed from the first round seed 4 5 or 6 while the number 2 seed will play the other team seed 3 4 or 52 the two surviving teams from each conferences divisional playoff games then meet in the respective afc and nfc conference championship games hosted by the higher seed with the winners of those contests going on to face one another in the super bowl only twice since 1990 has neither a number oneseeded team nor a number twoseeded team hosted a conference championship game in the 2006 afc championship the 3 seeded indianapolis colts hosted the 4 seeded new england patriots with the colts winning 38–34 and the 2008 nfc championship the 4 seeded arizona cardinals hosting the 6 seeded philadelphia eagles with the cardinals winning 32–25 if teams are tied having the same regular season wonlosttied record the playoff seeding is determined by a set of tiebreaking rules1 one potential disadvantage is that the two teams with the best records in a conference could play each other before the conference championship if they are in the same division the better team would be seeded 1 while the lesser team would be seeded 5 as the top wildcard team and as shown in the diagram it is possible for the 1 division winner to play the top wildcard team in the divisional round see also the modification proposals section below the new york giants and new york jets have shared the same home stadium since 1984 first giants stadium from 1984 to 2009 and metlife stadium since 2010 thus if both teams need to host playoff games on the same weekend they are always required to play on separate days even during the conference championship round the only time such a scheduling conflict has occurred was during wildcard weekend in 1985 when only 10 teams qualified for the postseason and there were only two wildcard games see the history section below instead of playing both wildcard games on the same day as was the case when the 10team system was used from 1978 to 1989 the new england patriots defeated the jets 26–14 on saturday december 28 before the giants beat the san francisco 49ers 17–3 on the following day breaking tiesedit often teams will finish a season with identical records it becomes necessary therefore to devise means to break these ties either to determine which teams will qualify for the playoffs or to determine seeding in the playoff tournament the rules below are applied in order until the tie is broken if three teams are tied for one playoff spot and the third team is eliminated at any step the tie breaker reverts to step one for the remaining two teams if multiple playoff spots are at stake the rules are applied in order until the first team qualifies then the process is started again for the remaining teams the tiebreaking rules have changed over the years with the most recent changes being made in 2002 to accommodate the leagues realignment into eight fourteam divisions record vs common opponents and most of the other criteria involving wins and losses were moved up higher in the tiebreaking list while those involving compiled stats such as points for and against were moved to the bottom13 the current tiebreakers are as follows with coin tosses used if all of the criteria fails4 divisional tiebreakers conference tiebreakers headtohead best wonlosttied percentage in games

overtime for any divisional tiebreak games beginning in 1940 and for championship games beginning in 1946 the first postseason game to be played under these rules was the 1958 nfl championship game between the baltimore colts and new york giants the socalled greatest game ever played overtime under the original format was sudden death the first team to score would be declared the winner in march 2010 the nfl amended its rules for postseason overtime with the rule being extended into the regular season in march 2012 if a team scores a touchdown or if the defense scores a safety on its first possession it is declared the winner if it scores a field goal on its first possession however it then kicks off to the opposing team which has an opportunity to score if the score is tied again after that possession true sudden death rules apply and whoever scores next will win since postseason games cannot end in a tie unlike the preseason or regular season additional overtime periods are played as necessary until a winner is determined furthermore all clock rules apply as if a game had started over therefore if the first overtime period ends with the score still tied the teams switch ends of the field prior to double overtime if a game was still tied with two minutes to go in double overtime there would be a twominute warning but not during the first overtime period as in the regular season and if it were still tied at the end of double overtime there would be a kickoff to start triple overtime5 although a contest could theoretically last indefinitely or last multiple overtime periods like several national hockey league postseason games no nfl playoff game has ever gone into tripleovertime the longest nfl game played to date is 82 minutes 40 seconds miami dolphins kicker

championships for playoff games of the american football league prior to the afl–nfl merger see afl playoffs the nfls method for determining its champions has changed over the years early yearsedit from the leagues founding in 1920 until 1932 there was no scheduled championship game from 1920–1923 the championship was awarded to a team by a vote of team owners at the annual owners meeting from 1924–1932 the team having the best winning percentage was awarded the championship as each team played a different number of games simply counting wins and losses would have been insufficient additionally tie games were not counted in the standings in figuring winning percentage under modern rules ties count as ½ win and ½ loss89 1932 playoff gameedit further information nfl playoff game 1932 in 1932 the chicago bears 6–1–6 and the portsmouth spartans 6–1–4 were tied at the end of the season with the identical winning percentage of 857 the green bay packers 10–3–1 had more wins but a lower winning percentage 769 as calculated under the rules of the day which omitted ties an additional game was therefore needed to determine a champion it was agreed that the game would be played in chicago at wrigley field but severe winter weather and fear of a low turnout forced the game to be moved indoors to chicago stadium the game was played under modified rules on a shortened 80yard dirt field and the bears won with a final score of 9–0810 as a result of the game the bears had the better winning percentage 875 and won the league title the loss gave the spartans a final winning percentage of 750 and moved them to third place behind the packers while there is no consensus that this game was a real championship game or even a playoff game it generated considerable interest and led to the creation of the official nfl championship game in 193310 before the super bowledit further information list of nfl champions given the interest of the impromptu championship game and the desire of the league to create a more equitable means of determining a champion the league divided into two conferences beginning in 1933 the winners of each conference the first place teams in the conferences met in the nfl championship game after the season there was no tiebreaker system in place any ties in the final standings of either conference resulted in a playoff game being played in 1941 1943 1947 two games in 1950 and one each in 1952 1957 1958 and 1965 since the venue and date of the championship game were often not known until the last game of the season had been played these playoff games sometimes resulted in delaying the end of the season by one week the playoff structure used from 1933 to 1966 was considered inequitable by some because of the number of times it failed to match the teams with the two best records in the championship game as only the conference winners would qualify for playoff contention four times between 1950 and 1966 in 1951 1956 1960 and 1963 the team with the secondbest winloss record did not qualify for the playoffs while the team with the best record in the other conference but only the thirdbest in the league would advance to the championship game for the 1967 nfl season the nfl expanded to 16 teams and split its two conferences into two divisions each with four teams in each division the four division champions would advance to the nfl playoffs and to remain on schedule a tiebreaker system was introduced the first round of playoffs determined the conferences champion and its representative in the nfl championship game played the following week thus 1967 was the first season there was a scheduled playoff tournament to determine the teams to play for the nfl championship11 during the three years 1967–69 that this playoff structure was in effect there was one use of the tiebreaker system in 1967 the los angeles rams and baltimore colts ended the season tied at 11–1–2 for the lead in the coastal division the colts came into the last game of the season undefeated but were beaten by the rams though the colts shared the best winloss record in the nfl that year they failed to advance to the playoffs while three other teams with worse records won their divisions this event figured into the decision in 1970 to include a wildcard team in the playoff tournament after the afl–nfl merger during the 1960s a thirdplace playoff game was played in miami called the playoff bowl it was contested in early january following the 1960–69 seasons though official playoff games at the time they were played the nfl now officially classifies these ten games and statistics as exhibitions not as playoff games12 afl and aafc playoffsedit since it would eventually merge with the nfl the history of the afls playoff system merits some explanation for the 1960–68 seasons the afl used the twodivisional format identical to the nfl to determine its champion there was no tiebreaker system in place so ties atop the eastern division final standings in 1963 and western division in 1968 necessitated playoff games to determine each divisions representative in the championship for the 1969 season a first round was added whereby each division winner played the secondplace team from the other division the winners of these games met in the afl championship game11 in the only year of this format the afl champion kansas city chiefs were the secondplace team in the western division the chiefs went on to win super bowl iv that season thus becoming the first nondivision winner to win a super bowl13 during its brief history the aafc who would merge into the nfl for the 1950 season used an identical playoff format to the nfl from 1946 to 1948 in 1949 its last year the aafc would merge its two conferences when one of its teams folded and use a fourteam playoff system in 1948 the aforementioned issue of playoff inequity came into play when the san francisco 49ers would miss the playoffs with a 12–2 record they were in the same conference as the 14–0 cleveland browns who would go on to win the western conference and then the aafcs championship game against the 7–7 buffalo bills aafc super bowl and mergeredit the super bowl began as an interleague championship game between the afl and nfl an idea first proposed by kansas city chiefs owner lamar hunt this compromise was the result of pressures the upstart afl was placing on the older nfl the success of the rival league would eventually lead to a full merger of the two leagues8 from the 1966 season to the 1969 season super bowls i–iv the game featured the champions of the afl and nfl since the 1970 season the game has featured the champions of the national football conference nfc and the american football conference afc when the leagues merged in 1970 the new nfl with 26 teams reorganized into two conferences of three divisions each from the 1970 season to the 1977 season four teams from each conference for a total of eight teams qualified for the playoffs each year these four teams included the three division champions and a fourth wildcard team14 originally the home teams in the playoffs were decided based on a yearly rotation15 from 1970 to 1974 the divisional playoff round rotated which of the three division champions would not have home field advantage with the wildcard teams and the teams they would face in the divisional playoff game would never have home field advantage throughout the playoffs starting in 1970 the divisional playoff games consisted of the afc central champions and the nfc west champions playing their games on the road then in 1971 it rotated to the afc east champions and the nfc east champions playing their games on the road in the 1972 divisional playoff games the afc west champions and the nfc central champions were the visiting teams and 1973 it would start all over with the afc central and nfc west again and so on the rotation system led to several playoff inequities such as in 1971 the teams with the two best records in each conference met in the divisional round in 1972 the dolphins had to take their perfect record to three rivers stadium to face the pittsburgh steelers who went 113 in the afc championship game in 1973 the cowboys finished 104 but hosted two 122 teams the los angeles rams and minnesota the league did not institute a seeding system for the playoffs until 1975 where the surviving clubs with the higher seeds were made the home teams for each playoff round8 thus the top seeded division winner played the wildcard team and the remaining two division winners played at the home stadium of the better seed which meant that the lowestseeded division winner had to open the postseason on the road however two teams from the same division could not meet prior to the conference championship game16 thus there would be times when the pairing in the divisional playoff round would be the 1 seed vs the 3 seed and 2 vs 4 expansionedit following an expansion of the regular season from 14 to 16 games in the 1978 season the league added one more wildcard team for each conference the two wildcard teams played the week before the division winners the winner of this game played the top seeded division winner as was done from 1970–1977 the league continued to prohibit intradivisional games in the divisional playoffs but allowed such contests in the wildcard round17 this tenteam playoff format was used through the 1989 season14 under this system the oakland raiders became the first wildcard team to win a super bowl following the 1980 season18 during the strikeshortened 1982 season only nine regular season games were played and a modified playoff format was instituted divisional play was ignored there were some cases where division rivals had both games wiped out by the strike although each division ultimately sent at least one team to the playoffs and the top eight teams from each conference based on wlt record were advanced to the playoffs as a result this became the first time that teams with losing records qualified for the playoffs the 4–5 cleveland browns and the 4–5 detroit lions19 several times between 1978–89 the two wildcard games had to be played on different days normally they both would be held on sunday in 1983 and 1988 the games were split between saturday and monday because sunday was christmas and the nfl had avoided playing on that day at the time in 1984 both games were played in the pacific time zone so they had to be played on saturday and sunday to accommodate for time differences in 1985 both the new york giants and jets hosted wildcard games as they have shared a home stadium since 1984 the games had to be played on different days for the 1990 season a third wildcard team for each conference was added expanding the playoffs to the current twelve teams the lowestseeded division winner was then demoted to the wildcard weekend also the restrictions on intradivisional games during the divisional playoffs were removed20 the 1990 format continued until the 2002 expansion and reorganization into eight divisions in this current format as explained above the 4 division winners and 2 wild cards are seeded 1–6 with the top 2 seeds receiving byes and the highest seed in each round guaranteed to play the lowest seed also seeds determine the homefield advantage14 modification proposalsedit there are some limitations that exist in the current 12team playoff system since being a division winner is a guaranteed playoff berth there have been many cases in which a team that wins a weak division either barely has a winning record as with the 2013 green bay packers or has a 500 or losing record altogether such as the 2010 seattle seahawks at the same time since a division winner is seeded higher than the wild cards nondivision winners may end up playing a road game during wild card weekend against a team with an inferior record or may end up outright missing the playoffs and going on the road during the first postseason round does not guarantee success the first time that all four road teams won during wild card weekend occurred during the 2015–16 season21 this issue has become more prevalent since the aforementioned 2002 realignment there are three notable examples in which a division winner with a 500 or sub500 record ended up winning a playoff game against a team with a superior record in the 2008–09 season the san diego chargers clinched the afc west with only an 8–8 record and hosted the 12–4 indianapolis colts in the wildcard round while the new england patriots failed to even secure a wildcard spot at 11–5 the chargers then went on to defeat the colts in that playoff game in the 2010–11 season the aforementioned 2010 seahawks won the nfc west with a 7–9 record hosting and defeating the 11–5 new orleans saints failing to make the playoffs were the new york giants and tampa bay buccaneers both with 10–6 records due to losing tiebreakers for the sixth seed to the green bay packers who went on to become the first sixthseeded team from the nfc to win the super bowl the 2010 seahawks were the first team in nfl history to win both a division championship and a playoff game with a losing regular season record they currently have the lowest win percentage of any team to ever make the playoffs in the 2014–15 season the carolina panthers won the nfc south with a 7–8–1 record by week 16 no team in that division could finish with more than seven wins the panthers then defeated the atlanta falcons who were 6–9 and undefeated within the division entering the game for the division title they hosted and defeated the 11–5 arizona cardinals in the wild card round the best team to miss the playoffs that year was the philadelphia eagles who finished 10–6 to date the 2014 panthers and 2010 seahawks are the only two teams to win a division and a playoff game with a losing record as a result of this seeding issue frequent calls have been made to modify the playoff format even further one proposal has been to expand the playoffs to 14 teams proponents of expansion note the increased revenue that could be gained from an additional two playoff games they also note that the 12team playoff system was implemented when the league only had 28 teams and six divisions of 4 to 5 teams each the opposition to such a move notes that an expansion of the playoffs would water down the field by giving access to lowercaliber teams opponents to expansion further point to the nba playoffs and the nhl playoffs where more than half of the teams qualify for the postseason and there is often a decreased emphasis on regular season performance as a result2223 after the 2007 playoffs saw two wildcard teams with better records jacksonville jaguars and eventual super bowl xlii champions new york giants go on the road to defeat division winners pittsburgh steelers and tampa bay buccaneers respectively during wildcard weekend the nfl explored another proposal to change the playoffs so that the team with the better record would host the game even if that meant a division winner went on the road the nfls competition committee withdrew the request later that offseason24 with atlanta falcons president rich mckay mentioning that they wanted the idea to simply get a discussion going new england patriots owner robert kraft was a strong opponent of the rule change believing that if you win a division its good for your fans to know you will have a home game24 just before the 2010–11 seahawkssaints playoff game mckay wanted to revisit the previous proposal to reseed teams during wildcard weekend25 however sportswriter peter king wrote that he believed league owners were still hesitant on implementing any such changes at this time due to the thenpending 2011 work stoppage the proposals to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games and how it will impact the postseason and the simple fact that not enough teams have been seriously disadvantaged by the current format26 in october 2013 nfl commissioner roger goodell announced plans to revisit the idea to expand the playoffs to 14 teams with the increased revenue gained from the two additional postseason games being used to offset plans to shorten the preseason27 the two extra wild card games could also be scheduled on the weekend creating tripleheaders on both saturday and sunday goodell then suggested that they might instead be played on friday andor monday which may eventually cause scheduling conflicts with games of the new college football playoff28 the 14team playoff proposal remained tabled until december 2014 when no team in the nfc south could finish better than 500 goodell stated that the league would vote on it at the march 2015 owners meetings one proposed 14club system includes giving firstround byes for the teams with the best record in each conference two division champions in each conference receiving home games and the remaining eight teams would be seeded by winloss record29 however by the following february 2015 the washington post reported that support among team owners has eroded and league leaders expressed reluctance to make a change until the oneyear extension with cbs to televise thursday night football expired at the end of the 2015 season30 the proposal lost all interest and as of 2017 has not been raised again it is likely that no movement will be made on expanding either the playoffs or the regular season until at least 2020 when the current collective bargaining agreement expires31
