immigrationedit a street in seattles nihonmachi in 1909 people from japan began migrating to the us in significant numbers following the political cultural and social changes stemming from the meiji restoration in 1868 large numbers went to hawaii and later the west coast in 1907 the gentlemens agreement between the governments of japan and the us ended immigration of japanese unskilled workers but permitted the immigration of businessmen students and spouses of japanese immigrants already in the us the immigration act of 1924 banned the immigration of nearly all japanese the ban on immigration produced unusually welldefined generational groups within the japanese american community original immigrants belonged to an immigrant generation the issei and their usborn children to the nisei japanese americangeneration the issei comprised exclusively those who had immigrated before 1924 because no new immigrants were permitted all japanese americans born after 1924 were—by definition—born in the us this generation the nisei became a distinct cohort from the issei generation in terms of age citizenship and englishlanguage ability in addition to the usual generational differences institutional and interpersonal racism led many of the nisei to marry other nisei resulting in a third distinct generation of japanese americans the sansei significant japanese immigration did not occur again until the immigration and nationality act of 1965 ended 40 years of bans against immigration from japan and other countries the naturalization act of 1790 restricted naturalized us citizenship to free white persons which excluded the issei from citizenship as a result the issei were unable to vote and faced additional restrictions such as the inability to own land under many state laws japanese americans were parties in several important supreme court decisions including ozawa v united states 1922 and korematsu v united states 1943 the korematsu case originated the strict scrutiny standard which is applied with great controversy in government considerations of race since the 1989 adarand constructors v peña decision in recent years immigration from japan has been more like that from western europe the numbers involve on average 5 to 10 thousand per year and is similar to the amount of immigration to the us from germany this is in stark contrast to the rest of asia where family reunification is the primary impetus for immigration japanese americans also have the oldest demographic structure of any noneuropean ethnic group in the us internment and redressedit main articles internment of japanese americans and japanese american redress and court cases families of japanese ancestry being removed from los angeles during world war ii during world war ii an estimated 120000 japanese americans and japanese nationals or citizens residing on the west coast of the united states were forcibly interned in ten different camps across the western interior of the country the internments were based on the race or ancestry rather than activities of the interned families including children were interned together decades later the civil liberties act of 1988 officially acknowledged the fundamental violations of the basic civil liberties and constitutional rights of the internment7 many japaneseamericans consider the term internment camp a euphemism and prefer to refer to the forced relocation of japaneseamericans as imprisonment in concentration camps8 websters new world fourth college edition defines a concentration camp as a prison camp in which political dissidents members of minority ethnic groups etc are confined cultural profileedit generationsedit the nomenclature for each of their generations who are citizens or longterm residents of countries other than japan used by japanese americans and other nationals of japanese descent are explained here they are formed by combining one of the japanese numbers corresponding to the generation with the japanese word for generation sei 世 the japanese american communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like issei nisei and sansei which describe the first second and third generations of immigrants the fourth generation is called yonsei 四世 and the fifth is called gosei 五世 the term nikkei 日系 encompasses japanese immigrants in all countries and of all generations generation summary issei 一世 the generation of people born in japan who later immigrated to another country nisei 二世 the generation of people born in north america latin america hawaii or

increasing numbers of japanese american nisei rituals are enactments of shared meanings norms and values and this traditional japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older9 languagesedit see also japanese language education in the united states issei and many nisei speak japanese in addition to english as a second language in general later generations of japanese americans speak english as their first language though some do learn japanese later as a second language in hawaii however where nikkei are about onefifth of the whole population japanese is a major language spoken and studied by many of the states residents across ethnicitiescitation needed it is taught in private japanese language schools as early as the second grade as a courtesy to the large number of japanese tourists from japan japanese subtexts are provided on place signs public transportation and civic facilities the hawaii media market has a few locally produced japanese language newspapers and magazines although these are on the verge of dying out due to a lack of interest on the part of the local hawaiiborn japanese population stores that cater to the tourist industry often have japanesespeaking personnel to show their allegiance to the us many nisei and sansei intentionally avoided learning japanese but as many of the later generations find their identities in both japan and america or american society broadens its definition of cultural identity studying japanese is becoming more popular than it once wascitation needed educationedit japanese american culture places great value on education and culture across generations children are often instilled with a strong desire to enter the rigors of higher education because of such widespread ambition among members of the japanese american community math and reading scores on the sat and act may often exceed the national averages japanese americans have the largest showing of any ethnic group in nationwide advanced placement testing each yearcitation needed a large majority of japanese americans obtain postsecondary degrees japanese americans often face the model minority stereotype that they are dominant in math and sciencerelated fields in colleges and universities across the united states in reality however there is an equal distribution of japanese americans between the arts and humanities and the sciencescitation needed although their numbers have declined slightly in recent years japanese americans are still a prominent presence in ivy league schools the top university of california campuses including uc berkeley and ucla and other elite universitiescitation needed the 2000 census reported that 408 of japanese americans held a college

other japanese schools for temporary settlers in north america followed11 in the years prior to world war ii many second generation japanese american attended the american school by day and the japanese school in the evening to keep up their japanese skill as well as english other first generation japanese american parents were worried that their child might go through the same discrimination when going to school so they gave them the choice to either go back to japan to be educated or to stay in america with their parents and study both languages12page needed antijapanese sentiment during world war i resulted in public efforts to close japaneselanguage schools the 1927 supreme court case farrington v tokushige protected the japanese american communitys right to have

before the 1960s the trend of japanese americans marrying partners outside their racial or ethnic group was generally low as well a great many traditional issei parents encouraged nisei to marry only within their ethniccultural group arrangements to purchase and invite picture brides from japan to relocate and marry issei or nisei males was commonplacecitation needed in california and other western states until the end of world war ii there were attempts to make it illegal for japanese and other asian americans to marry european americans but those laws were declared unconstitutional by the us supreme court like the antimiscegenation laws which prevented european americans from marrying african americans in the 1960s according to a 1990 statistical survey by the japan society of america the sansei or third generations have an estimated 20 to 30 percent outofgroup marriage while the 4th generation or yonsei approaches nearly 50 percent during the world war ii internment era the us executive order 9066 had an inclusion of orphaned infants with one drop of japanese blood as explained in a letter by one official or the order stated anyone at least onesixteenth japanese

widespread intermarriage of japanese americans including those who passed as white or halfasianeuropean religionedit japanese americans practice a wide range of religions including mahayana buddhism jōdo shinshū jōdoshū nichiren shingon and zen forms being most prominent their majority faith shinto and christianity in many ways due to the longstanding nature of buddhist and shinto practices in japanese society many of the cultural values and traditions commonly associated with japanese tradition have been strongly influenced by these religious forms a large number of the japanese american community continue to practice buddhism in some form and a number of community traditions and festivals continue to center around buddhist institutions for example one of the most popular community festivals is the annual obon festival which occurs in the summer and provides an opportunity to reconnect with their customs and traditions and to pass these traditions and customs to the young these kinds of festivals are mostly popular in communities with large populations of japanese americans such as southern california and hawaii it should be noted however that a reasonable number of japanese people both in and out of japan are secular as shinto and buddhism are most often practiced by rituals such as marriages or funerals and not through faithful worship as defines religion for many americans many japanese americans practice christianity among mainline denominations the presbyterians have long been active the first japanese presbyterian church of san francisco opened in 188520 there is also the japanese evangelical missionary society jems formed in the 1950s it operates asian american christian fellowships aacf programs on university campuses especially in california21 the japanese language ministries are fondly known as nichigo in japanese american christian communities the newest trend includes asian american members who do not have a japanese heritage22 celebrationsedit an important annual festival for japanese americans is the obon festival which happens in july or august of each year across the country japanese americans gather on fair grounds churches and large civic parking lots and commemorate the memory of their ancestors and their families through folk dances and food carnival booths are usually set up so japanese american children

support for candidates in both political parties shortly prior to the 2004 us presidential election japanese americans narrowly favored democrat john kerry by a 42 to 38 margin over republican george w bush23 in the 2008 us presidential election the national asian american survey found that japanese american favored democrat barack obama by a 62 to 16 margin over republican john mccain while 22 were still undecided24 geneticsedit the distribution of the ychromosome among japanese males is a lot different from the males of neighboring countries such as in taiwanese males the y chromosome is directly correlated to asian populations especially in japanese americans the chromosome addition of y alu polymorphic element is only displayed in japanese american men people of japanese descent show the highest frequency of the haplogroup o3a5 haplogroups are groups of genetic populations that share a common ancestor paternally or maternally the frequency of this haplogroup is about 5 higher than its frequency in other asian groups such as koreans manchus and other northeast asians the japanese dna sequence consists of 242 korean 161 okinawa 48 uniquely japanese 258 chinese 81 ainu and 21 unidentified with the ainu there has been research that that group were descendants of the caucasian group the ainu people were the key to the japanese genetic origins because researchers found an exact dna match with the ainu and the jomon japanese to conclude the ainu rooted all the way back to the jomon25 from mainland japanese people the mtdna haplogroup frequencies are most occurring in the d4 haplogroup with about 33 with the second largest frequency in the b4 haplogroup containing about 9 and the third largest frequency in the m7a haplogroup occurring at about 8 the rest of the other haplogroup frequencies are much smaller than d4 with frequencies ranging from about 35 consisting of mostly n9a m8 and m9 haplogroups between the different japanese populations the yayoi population has the highest haplogroup frequencies of the d4 haplogroup the jomon japanese group has the highest frequency of the n9b haplogroup in modern japanese americans the highest haplogroup frequency is in the d4 haplogroup the same as the yayoi japanese population in okinawa japanese populations the highest frequency of haplogroups is the d haplogroup with the m7a haplogroup frequency directly behind of the ainu japanese population the highest haplogroup frequency occurs in the g haplogroup with an even distribution of frequency in the m7a and y haplogroups lastly for mainland japanese populations the d haplogroup presents the highest frequency2627 in japanese americans the biggest components are chinese korean and okinawan people of japanese descent show two preyayoi ancestral y chromosome lineages descended from paleolithic people who had been isolated on the mainland of japan studies of the mitochondrial component of japanese american genes of haplogroup m12 shows a direct correlation of japanese haplotypes with tibetans other haplotypes that early descents of japanese people were thought to be carried into include cm8 which is another ychromosome haplotype also going back to the jomon that gene is displayed in high frequencies in people of japanese descent the estimated percentage of this type of gene in japanese americans is about 347 the highest frequencies occur in okinawans and hokkaidos28 overall the genetic makeup of japanese americans show very mixed origins of genes all due to the result of migrations of the japanese ancestors in the past risk for inherited diseasesedit studies have looked into the risk factors that are more prone to japanese americans specifically in hundreds of family generations of nisei the generation of people born in north america latin america hawaii or any country outside japan either to at least one issei or one nonimmigrant japanese parent secondgeneration probands a person serving as the starting point for the genetic study of a family used in medicine and psychiatry the risk factors for genetic diseases in japanese americans include coronary heart disease and diabetes one study called the japanese american community diabetes study that started in 1994 and went through 2003 involved the probands taking part to test whether the increased risk of diabetes among japanese americans is due to the effects of japanese americans having a more westernized lifestyle due to the many differences between the united states of america and japan one of the main goals of the study was to create an archive of dna samples which could be used to identify which diseases are more susceptible in japanese americans concerns with these studies of the risks of inherited diseases in japanese americans is that information pertaining to the genetic relationship may not be consistent with the reported biological family information given of nisei second generation probands29 also research has been put on concerning apolipoprotein e genotypes this polymorphism has three alleles e2 e3 and e4and was determined from research because of its known association with increased cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease in japanese americans specifically too the apolipoprotein e4 allele is linked to alzheimer’s disease as well also there is increased coronary heart disease in japaneseamerican men with a mutation in the cholesterol ester transfer protein gene despite having increased levels of hdl by definition hdl are plasma high density lipoproteins that show a genetic relationship with coronary heart disease chd the cholesterol ester transfer proteincetp helps the transfer of cholesterol esters from lipoproteins to other lipoproteins in the human body it plays a fundamental role in the reverse transport of cholesterol to the liver which is why a mutation in this can lead to coronary heart disease studies have shown that the cetp is linked to increased hdl levels there is a very common pattern of two different cholesterol ester transfer protein gene mutations d442g 51 intron 14ga 05 found in about 3469 japanese american men this was based off a program called the honolulu heart program the mutations correlated with decreased cetp levels 35 and increased hdl cholesterol levels 10 for d442g the relative risk of chd was 143 in men with mutations p005 and after research found for chd risk factors the relative risk went up to 155 p002 after further adjustments for hdl levels the relative risk went up again to 168 p0008 genetic cetp deficiency is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease which is due mainly to increased chd risks in japanese american men with the d442g mutation and lipoprotein cholesterol levels between 41 and 60 mgdl30 with research and investigations the possibility of finding “bad genes” denounces the japanese americans and will be associated only with japanese american ancestry leading to
