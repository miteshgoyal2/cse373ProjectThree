politics portal v t e american conservatism is a broad system of political beliefs in the united states that is characterized by respect for american traditions support for judeochristian values moral absolutism economic liberalism anticommunism advocacy of american exceptionalism and a defense of western culture from threats posed by creeping socialism moral relativism multiculturalism and liberal internationalism liberty is a core value with a particular emphasis on strengthening the free market limiting the size and scope of government in the economy and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur american conservatives consider individual liberty within the bounds of conformity to american values as the fundamental trait of democracy which contrasts with modern american liberals who generally place a greater value on equality and social justice12 american conservatism originates from republicanism which rejected aristocratic and monarchical government based on the principles of the declaration of independence of 1776 which stated that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in 1789 the constitution of united states established a federal republic under the rule of law all major american political parties are based on these two documents conservative activists to this day occasionally dress in costumes from the revolutionary era and celebrate revolutionary episodes such as the boston tea party conservative philosophy also has continuity to the classical liberal tradition of the 18th and 19th centuries which advocated for laissezfaire economics also called economic freedom34 historians argue that the conservative tradition has played a major role in american politics and culture since 1776 however they have stressed that an organized conservative movement has played a key role in politics only since the 1950s5page needed67 the recent movement is based in the republican party though some democrats were also important figures early in the movements history89 according to peter viereck american conservatism is distinctive because it was not tied to a monarchy landed aristocracy established church or military elite10 instead american conservatives were firmly rooted in american republicanism which european conservatives opposed they are committed says seymour martin lipset to the belief in americas superiority against the cold reactionary monarchical and more rigidly

been marked by tensions and competing ideologies fiscal conservatives and libertarians favor small government laissezfaire economy low income and corporate taxes limited regulation and free enterprise social conservatives see traditional social values as threatened by secularism they tend to support voluntary school prayer and oppose abortion and same sex marriage1213141516 the 21st century has seen an increase in conservative support for the second amendment to the united states constitution neoconservatives want to expand american ideals throughout the world17 paleoconservatives advocate restrictions on immigration noninterventionist foreign policy and stand in opposition to multiculturalism18 nationwide most factions except some libertarians support a unilateral foreign policy and a strong military the conservative movement of the 1950s attempted to bring together these divergent strands stressing the need for unity to prevent the spread of godless communism19 william f buckley jr in the first issue of his magazine national review in 1955 explained the standards of his magazine and helped make explicit the beliefs of american conservatives20 among our convictions it is the job of centralized government in peacetime to protect its citizens lives liberty and property all other activities of government tend to diminish freedom and hamper progress the growth of government the dominant social feature of this century must be fought relentlessly in this great social conflict of the era we are without reservations on the libertarian side the profound crisis of our era is in essence the conflict between the social engineers who seek to adjust mankind to scientific utopias and the disciples of truth who defend the organic moral order we believe that truth is neither arrived at nor illuminated by monitoring election results binding though these are for other purposes but by other means including a study of human experience on this point we are without reservations on the conservative side ideology and political philosophyedit traditional burkean conservatives tend to be antiideological and some would even say antiphilosophical21 promoting rather as russell kirk explained a steady flow of prescription and prejudice kirks use of the word prejudice here is not intended to carry its contemporary pejorative connotation a conservative himself he believed that the inherited wisdom of the ages may be a better guide than apparently rational individual judgment there are two overlapping subgroups of social conservatives—the traditional and the religious traditional conservatives strongly support traditional codes of conduct especially those they feel are threatened by social change and modernization for example traditional conservatives may oppose the use of female soldiers in combat religious conservatives focus on conducting society as prescribed by a religious authority or code in the united states this translates into taking hardline stances on moral issues such as opposition to abortion and homosexuality religious conservatives often assert that america is a christian nation and call for laws that enforce christian morality fiscal conservatives support limited government low tax low spending and a balanced budget they argue that low taxes produce more jobs and wealth for everyone and also that as president grover cleveland said unnecessary taxation is unjust taxation22 a recent movement against the inheritance tax labels such a tax as a death tax fiscal conservatives often argue that competition in the free market is more effective than the regulation of industry some make exceptions in the case of trusts or monopolies others such as some libertarians and followers of ludwig von mises believe all government intervention in the economy is wasteful corrupt and immoral more moderate fiscal conservatives argue that free market economics is the most efficient way to promote economic growth they support it not based on some moral principle but pragmatically because they hold that it just works most modern american fiscal conservatives accept some social spending programs not specifically delineated in the constitution as such fiscal conservatism today exists somewhere between classical liberalism and contemporary consequentialist political philosophies through much of the 20th century a primary force uniting the varied strands of conservatism and uniting conservatives with liberals and socialists was opposition to communism which was seen not only as an enemy of the traditional order but also the enemy of western freedom and democracy thus it was the british labour government—which embraced socialism—that pushed the truman administration in 1945–47 to take a strong stand against soviet communism23 social conservatism and traditionedit main article social conservatism in the united states yes on 8 rally in fresno california social conservatism in the united states is the defense of traditional social norms and judeochristian values242526 social conservatives tend to strongly identify with american nationalism and patriotism they often denounce antiwar protesters and support the police and the military they hold that military institutions embody core values such as honor duty courage loyalty and a willingness on the part of the individual to make sacrifices for the good of the country social conservatives are strongest in the south and in recent years played a major role in the political coalitions of ronald reagan george w bush and sarah palin27 fiscal conservatism and economic liberalismedit main articles fiscal conservatism and economic liberalism fiscal conservatism is the economic and political policy that advocates restraint of progressive taxation and expenditure fiscal conservatives since the 19th century have argued that debt is a device to corrupt politics they argue that big spending ruins the morals of the people and that a national debt creates a dangerous class of speculators a political strategy employed by conservatives to achieve a smaller government is known as starve the beast activist grover norquist is a wellknown proponent of the strategy and has famously said my goal is to cut government in half in twentyfive years to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub2829 the argument in favor of balanced budgets is often coupled with a belief that government welfare programs should be narrowly tailored and that tax rates should be low which implies relatively small government institutions this belief in small government combines with fiscal conservatism to produce a broader economic liberalism which wishes to minimize government intervention in the economy or implement laissezfaire policies this economic liberalism borrows from two schools of thought the classical liberals pragmatism and the libertarians notion of rights the classical liberal maintains that free markets work best while the libertarian contends that free markets are the only ethical markets historian kathleen g donohue argues that classical liberalism in the 19th century us had distinctive characteristics as opposed to britain at the center of classical liberal theory in europe was the idea of laissezfaire to the vast majority of american classical liberals however laissezfaire did not mean no government intervention at all on the contrary they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs railroad subsidies and internal improvements all of which benefited producers what they condemned was intervention in behalf of consumers30 the economic philosophy of conservatives in the united states tends to be more liberal allowing for more economic freedom economic liberalism can go well beyond fiscal conservatisms concern for fiscal prudence to a belief or principle that it is not prudent for governments to intervene in markets it is also sometimes extended to a broader small government philosophy economic liberalism is associated with free market or laissezfaire economics economic liberalism insofar as it is ideological owes its creation to the classical liberal tradition in the vein of adam smith friedrich a hayek milton friedman and ludwig von mises classical liberals and libertarians support free markets on moral ideological grounds principles of individual liberty morally dictate support for free markets supporters of the moral grounds for free markets include ayn rand and ludwig von mises the liberal tradition is suspicious of government authority and prefers individual choice and hence tends to see free market capitalism as the preferable means of achieving economic ends modern conservatives on the other hand derive support for free markets from practical grounds free markets they argue are the most productive markets thus the modern conservative supports free markets not out of necessity but out of expedience the support is not moral or ideological but driven on the burkean notion of prescription what works best is what is right another reason why conservatives support a smaller role for the government in the economy is the belief in the importance of the civil society as noted by alexis de tocqueville there is a belief that a bigger role of the government in the economy will make people feel less responsible for the society these responsibilities would then need to be taken over by the government requiring higher taxes in his book democracy in america tocqueville described this as soft oppression play media ronald reagan gives a televised address from the oval office outlining his plan for tax reductions in july 1981 excerpt while classical liberals and modern conservatives reached free markets through different means historically in recent years the lines have blurred rarely will a conservative politician claim that free markets are simply more productive or simply the right thing to do but a combination of both this blurring is very much a product of the merging of the classical liberal and modern conservative positions under the umbrella of the conservative movement the archetypal freemarket conservative administrations of the late 20th century—the margaret thatcher government in britain and the ronald reagan administration in the us—both held the unfettered operation of the market to be the cornerstone of contemporary modern conservatism31 to that end thatcher privatized industries and public housing and reagan cut the maximum capital gains tax from 28 to 20 though in his second term he agreed to raise it back up to 28 reagan also cut individual income tax rates lowering the maximum rate from 70 to 28 he wanted to increase defense spending and achieved that liberal democrats blocked his efforts to cut domestic spending32 reagan did not control the rapid increase in federal government spending or reduce the deficit but his record looks better when expressed as a percent of the gross domestic product federal revenues as a percent of the gdp fell from 196 in 1981 when reagan took office to 183 in 1989 when he left federal spending fell slightly from 222 of the gdp to 212 this contrasts with statistics from 2004 when government spending was rising more rapidly than it had in decades33 typesedit see also factions in the republican party united states in the united states today the word conservative is often used very differently from the way it is used in europe and asia the americans after 1776 rejected the core ideals of european conservatism which were based on the landed aristocracy the established church and the powerful prestigious army conservatism in the united states is not a single school of thought34 barry goldwater in the 1960s spoke for a free enterprise conservatism jerry falwell in the 1980s preached traditional moral and religious social values it was reagans challenge to form these groups into an electable coalition35 in the 21st century us some of the groups calling themselves conservative include christian conservatism – conservative christians are primarily interested in family values typical positions include the view that the united states was founded as a christian nation that abortion is wrong that there should be prayer in state schools that intelligent design or creationism should be taught in schools alongside evolution and that marriage should be defined as between one man and one woman and not between two members of the same sex many attack the profanity and sexuality in the media and movies36 constitutional conservatism a form of conservatism bound within the limits provided within the united states constitution defending the structures of constitutionalism and preserving the principles of the united states constitution37 chief among those principles is the defense of liberty38 this form of conservatism coalesced in the republican party in the early 20th century in opposition to progressivism within the party it can also be seen being influential to the 21st century tea party movement39 constitutional conservatism has also been associated with judicial originalism40 libertarian conservatism – a fusion with libertarianism this type emphasizes a strict interpretation of the constitution particularly with regard to federal power libertarian conservatism is constituted by a broad sometimes conflicted coalition including probusiness social moderates those favoring more rigid enforcement of states rights individual liberty activists and many of those who place their socially liberal ideology ahead of their fiscal beliefs this mode of thinking tends to espouse laissezfaire economics and a critical view of the federal government libertarian conservatives emphasis on personal freedom often leads them to have social positions contrary to those of social conservatives especially on such issues as marijuana abortion and homosexuality ron paul and his son rand paul have been influential proponents in the republican presidential contests41 neoconservatism – a modern form of conservatism that supports a more assertive interventionist foreign policy aimed at promoting democracy abroad it is tolerant of an activist government at home but is focused mostly on international affairs neoconservatism was first described by a group of disaffected liberals and thus irving kristol usually credited as its intellectual progenitor defined a neoconservative as a liberal who was mugged by reality although originally regarded as an approach to domestic policy the founding instrument of the movement kristols the public interest periodical did not even cover foreign affairs through the influence of figures like dick cheney robert kagan richard perle kenneth adelman and irvings son bill kristol it has become most famous for its association with the foreign policy of the george w bush administration in the middle east that used the military to promote democracy42 paleoconservatism – in part a rebirth of the old right arising in the 1980s in reaction to neoconservatism stresses tradition especially christian tradition and the importance to society of the traditional family some samuel p huntington for example argue that multiracial multiethnic and egalitarian states are inherently unstable43 paleoconservatives are generally isolationist and suspicious of foreign influence the magazines chronicles and the american conservative are generally considered to be paleoconservative in nature44 traditionalist conservatism – opposition to rapid change in political and social institutions this kind of conservatism is antiideological insofar as it emphasizes means slow change over ends any particular form of government to the traditionalist whether one arrives at a right or leftwing government is less important than whether change is effected through rule of law rather than through revolution and utopian schemes45 historyedit main article history of conservatism in the united states in the united states there has never been a national political party called the conservative party46 all major american political parties support republicanism and the basic classical liberal ideals on which the country was founded in 1776 emphasizing liberty the rule of law the consent of the governed and that all men were created equal47 political divisions inside the united states often seemed minor or trivial to europeans where the divide between the left and the right led to violent polarization starting with the french revolution48 historian patrick allitt expresses the difference between liberal and conservative in terms not of policy but of attitude certain continuities can be traced through american history the conservative attitude was one of trusting to the past to longestablished patterns of thought and conduct and of assuming that novelties were more likely to be dangerous than advantageous49 no american party has advocated european ideals of conservatism such as a monarchy an established church or a hereditary aristocracy american conservatism is best characterized as a reaction against utopian ideas of progress50 russell kirk saw the american revolution itself as a conservative reaction in the english political tradition against royal innovation51 recent policiesedit russell kirk conservative theorist president ronald reagan set the conservative standard in the 1980s in the 2010s the republican leaders typically claim fealty to it for example most of the republican candidates in 2012 claimed to be standard bearers of reagans ideological legacy52 reagan solidified conservative republican strength with tax cuts a greatly increased military budget continued deregulation a policy of rollback of communism rather than just containing it and appeals to family values and conservative morality the 1980s and beyond became known as the reagan era53 typically conservative politicians and spokesmen in the 21st century proclaim their devotion to reagans ideals and policies on most social economic and foreign policy issues other modern conservative beliefs include skepticism of the theory of manmade global warming and opposition to government action to combat it which conservatives contend would do severe economic damage and ultimately more harm than good even if one accepts the premise that human activity is contributing to climate change5455 they support a strong policy of law and order to control crime including long jail terms for repeat offenders most conservatives support the death penalty for particularly egregious crimes the law and order issue was a major factor weakening liberalism in the 1960s56 from 2001 to 2008 republican president george w bush stressed cutting taxes and minimizing regulation of industry and banking while increasing regulation of education57 conservatives generally advocate the use of american military power to fight terrorists and promote democracy in the middle east according to a 2014 poll 38 of american voters identify as conservative or very conservative 34 as moderate 24 as liberal or very liberal58 these percentages were fairly constant from 1990 to 200959 when conservatism spiked in popularity briefly60 before reverting to the original trend while liberal views on social issues reached a new high although the study does show some distinction between the concentration of moderates and conservatives or liberals between the republican and democratic parties among democrats 44 are selfidentified liberals 19 as conservatives and 36 as moderates for republicans 70 selfidentified as conservative 24 as moderate and 5 as liberal conservatism appears to be growing stronger at the state level the trend is most pronounced among the least welloff least educated most blue collar most economically hardhit states6162 conservatives generally believe that government action is not the solution to such problems as poverty and inequality many believe that government programs that seek to provide services and opportunities for the poor actually encourage dependence and reduce selfreliance most conservatives oppose affirmative action policies that is policies in employment education and other areas that give special advantages to people who belong to groups that have been historically discriminated against conservatives believe that the government should not give special benefits to people on the basis of group identity and oppose it as reverse discrimination conservatives typically hold that the government should play a smaller role in regulating business and managing the economy they typically oppose high tax rates and programs to redistribute income to assist the poor such efforts they argue do not properly reward people who have earned their money through hard work however conservatives usually place a strong emphasis on the role of private voluntary charitable organizations especially faithbased charities in helping the poor as conservatives value order and security they favor a small but strong government role in law enforcement and national defense social issuesedit on social issues many religious conservatives oppose changes in traditional moral standards regarding sexuality and gender roles they oppose abortion samesex marriage and antidiscrimination laws against homosexuals63 the libertarian faction tends to ignore these issues instead focusing on fiscal and monetary policy businessoriented conservatives oppose the social conservatives if state laws limiting gay rights threaten to hurt business the national review reported in 2016 that as evangelical forces have become less unifiedthe influence of rightleaning business groups such as the chamber of commerce has only grown6465 in the culture war of recent decades multiculturalism has been a flashpoint especially regarding the humanities curriculum historian peter n stearns finds a polarization since the 1960s between conservatives who believe that the humanities express eternal truths that should be taught and those who think that the humanities curriculum should be tailored to demonstrate diversity66 generally conservatism opposes the identity politics associated with multiculturalism and supports individualism67 in campus battles progressives demand cultural diversity while conservatives denounce efforts to impose political correctness and stifle free speech68 conservatives typically favor a melting pot model of assimilation into common englishspeaking american culture as opposed to a salad bowl approach that lends legitimacy to many different cultures6970 in the 21st century conservatives have warned on the dangers of tolerating radical islamic elements of the sort that they say are engaging in largescale terrorism in europe71 electoral politicsedit in the united states the republican party has been the party of conservatism since the 1890s although there was a strong eastern liberal wing since 1964 the conservatives largely took control meanwhile the conservative wing of the democratic party based in the south and strongly opposed to civil rights grew weaker the most dramatic realignment took place within the white south which moved from 3–1 democratic to 3–1 republican between 1960 and 2000 in addition some american libertarians in the libertarian party and even some in the republican party see themselves as conservative even though they advocate significant economic and social changes—for instance further dismantling the welfare system or liberalizing drug policy they see these as conservative policies because they conform to the spirit of individual liberty that they consider to be a traditional american value however many libertarian thinktanks such as the cato institute and libertarian intellectuals such as david boaz describe libertarianism as being socially liberal and fiscally conservative7273 former texas congressman ron paul is one of the most wellnoted republicans with a libertarianleaning philosophy espousing a return to a stricter interpretation of the constitution an audit of the federal reserve system and an end to american interventionism in other parts of the world paul gained a loyal following among libertarians displaced conservatives in the republican party and also made inroads with some democrats during two failed attempts to gain the republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012 paul an obstetrician by training also ran as the 1988 libertarian party presidential nominee on the other hand some conservatives tend to oppose freemarket trade policies and support protectionism instead they want government intervention to support the economy and protect american jobs they oppose free trade on the ground that it benefits other countries especially china in the expense of american workers however in spite of their support for protectionism they tend to support other freemarket principles like low taxes small government and balanced budgets geographyedit percent of selfidentified conservatives by state in 201074   49 and above   45–48   41–44   37–40   33–36   32 and under the south the great plains the rocky mountain states and alaska are generally conservative strongholds the northeast great lakes region and west coast are the main liberal strongholds conservatives are strongest in rural america and to a lesser extent in the exurbs or suburbs voters in the urban cores of large metropolitan areas tend to be more liberal and democratic thus within each state there is a division between urban suburban exurban and rural areas75 in recent decades the electoral geography has helped give republicans control of the house of representatives and democrats a decided edge in the electoral college which elects the president76 other topicsedit kirks principles of conservatismedit russell kirk developed six canons of conservatism which gerald j russello described as follows a belief in a transcendent order which kirk described variously as based in tradition divine revelation or natural law an affection for the variety and mystery of human existence a conviction that society requires orders and classes that emphasize natural distinctions a belief that property and freedom are closely linked a faith in custom convention and prescription and a recognition that innovation must be tied to existing traditions and customs which entails a respect for the political value of prudence77 kirk said that christianity and western civilization are unimaginable apart from one another78 and that all culture arises out of religion when religious faith decays culture must decline though often seeming to flourish for a space after the religion which has nourished it has sunk into disbelief79 in later works kirk expanded this list into his ten principles of conservatism80 which are as follows first the conservative believes that there exists an enduring moral order second the conservative adheres to custom convention and continuity third conservatives believe in what may be called the principle of prescription fourth conservatives are guided by their principle of prudence fifth conservatives pay attention to the principle of variety sixth conservatives are chastened by their principle of imperfectability seventh conservatives are persuaded that freedom and property are closely linked eighth conservatives uphold voluntary community quite as they oppose involuntary collectivism ninth the conservative perceives the need for prudent restraints upon power and upon human passions tenth the thinking conservative understands that permanence and change must be recognized and reconciled in a vigorous society courtsedit one stream of conservatism exemplified by william howard taft extols independent judges as experts in fairness and the final arbiters of the constitution in 1910 theodore roosevelt broke with most of his lawyer friends and called for popular votes that could overturn unwelcome decisions by state courts taft denounced his old friend and rallied conservatives to defeat him for the 1912 gop nomination taft and the conservative republicans controlled the supreme court until the late 1930s8182 president franklin d roosevelt a liberal democrat did not attack the supreme court directly in 1937 but ignited a firestorm of protest by a proposal to add seven new justices conservative democrats immediately broke with fdr defeated his proposal and built up the conservative coalition while the liberals did take over the court through replacements they lost control of congress that is the court no longer overthrew liberal laws passed by congress but there were very few such laws that passed in 1937–6083 a recent variant of conservatism condemns judicial activism that is judges using their decisions to control policy along the lines of the warren court in the 1960s it came under conservative attack for decisions regarding redistricting desegregation and the rights of those accused of crimes this position goes back to jeffersons vehement attacks on federal judges and to abraham lincolns attacks on the dred scott decision of 18578485 originalismedit main article originalism a more recent variant that emerged in the 1970s is originalism the assertion that the united states constitution should be interpreted to the maximum extent possible in the light of what it meant when it was adopted originalism should not be confused with a similar conservative ideology strict constructionism which deals with the interpretation of the constitution as written but not necessarily within the context of the time when it was adopted in modern times the term originalism has been used by supreme court justice antonin scalia former federal judge robert bork and some other conservative jurists to explain their beliefs86 opposition to environmentalismedit in the past conservatives have supported conservation efforts from the protection of the yosemite valley to the creation of the environmental protection agency87 however more recently neoconservatives have opposed environmentalism with environmentalists often ridiculed as tree huggers republican party leaders such as newt gingrich and michele bachmann advocate the abolition of the epa calling it the jobkilling organization of america 88 conservative think tanks since the 1990s have opposed the concept of manmade global warming they challenged scientific evidence publicised what they perceived as beneficial aspects of global warming and stated their strong beliefs that proposed remedies would do more harm than good89 the concept of anthropogenic global warming continues to be an ongoing debate amongst conservatives in the united states90 but the majority reject the scientific consensus that climate change is caused by humans 73 of republicans believed humans were uninvolved in causing global warming according to a 2015 poll by pew research91 in recent times american conservatives have generally supported deregulation of pollution and reduced restrictions on carbon emissions92 similarly they have advocated increased oil drilling with less regulatory interference such as in the arctic national wildlife refuge93 in the 2008 election the phrase drill baby drill was used to express the republican position on the subject94 semantics language and mediaedit vocabularyedit socialismedit the term socialist has been used as a rhetorical weapon against the left by conservatives9596 david hinshaw writes that william allen white editor of a smalltown newspaper in kansas from 1895 used socialistic as his big gun to blast radical opposition97 white set americanism as the alternative warning the election will sustain americanism or it will plant socialism white became famous when mark hanna campaign manager for republican candidate william mckinley distributed upwards of a million or more copies of one white editorial to rally opposition to william jennings bryan the nominee of both the democratic and populist parties9899 by the 1950s the conservative press had discovered that the word socialism proved to be a successful derogatory epithet rather than a descriptive label for a meaningful political alternative100 at the 1952 republican national convention former president herbert hoover repeated his warnings about two decades of new deal policies denouncing says gary best the usurpation of power by the federal government the loss of freedom in america the poisoning of the american economy with fascism socialism and keynesianism the enormous growth of the federal bureaucracy101 barry goldwater in 1960 called for republican unity against john f kennedy and the blueprint for socialism presented by the democrats102 goldwater in 1964 attacked central planners like fellow republican nelson rockefeller implying he was a socialist in a millionaires garb the democratic party believes in what i call socialism and if that upsets anybodys stomach let me remind you that central planning of our economy is socialism103 ronald reagan often quoted norman thomas the perennial socialist nominee for president in the new deal era as saying the american people would never knowingly vote for socialism but that under the name of liberalism they would adopt every fragment of the socialist program104 in 2010 newt gingrich defined socialism in the broad sense as a governmentdominated bureaucraticallycontrolled politiciandictated way of life105 gingrich believes barack obama is committed to this form of socialism105 mediaedit talk radio and fox newsedit rush limbaugh 2009 conservatives gained a major new communications medium with the resurgence of talk radio in the late 1980s rush limbaugh proved there was a huge nationwide audience for specific and heated discussions of current events from a conservative viewpoint other major hosts who describe themselves as conservative include michael peroutka jim quinn dennis miller ben ferguson william bennett andrew wilkow lars larson sean hannity g gordon liddy laura ingraham mike church glenn beck mark levin michael savage kim peterson ben shapiro michael reagan jason lewis ken hamblin and herman cain106 the salem radio network syndicates a group of religiously oriented republican activists including roman catholic hugh hewitt and jewish conservatives dennis prager and michael medved one popular jewish conservative laura schlessinger offers parental and personal advice but is outspoken on social and political issues in 2011 the largest weekly audiences for talk radio were 15 million for limbaugh and 14 million for hannity with about nine million each for glenn beck michael savage and mark levin the audiences overlap depending on how many each listener dials into every week107 fox news features conservative hosts108 one such host is sean hannity who also has a talk radio program109 one former host is matt drudge110 prior and after his time on fox news drudge has operated drudge report a news aggregation website and is a selfprofessed conservative111 it is more conservative than other news sources in the united states such as national public radio and cnn112 critic david frum has argued that the influence of conservative talk radio and fox news has harmed american conservatism turning it from a political philosophy into a market segment for extremism and conflict making for bad politics but great tv backed by the conservative bookpublishing industry and think tanks talk radio and fox news have built a whole alternative knowledge system with its own facts its own history its own laws of economics outside this alternative reality the united states is a country dominated by a strong christian religiosity within it christians are a persecuted minority outside the system president obama—whatever his policy errors—is a figure of imposing intellect and dignity within the system hes a pitiful nothing unable to speak without a teleprompter an affirmativeaction phony doomed to inevitable defeat outside the system social scientists worry that the us is hardening into one of the most rigid class societies in the western world in which the children of the poor have less chance of escape than in france germany or even britain inside the system the us remains to borrow the words of senator marco rubio the only place in the world where it doesnt matter who your parents were or where you came from113 academiaedit admission to academeedit liberal and leftist viewpoints have dominated higher education faculties since the 1970s according to many studies114115116 whereas conservatives are better represented in policyoriented think tanks data from a survey conducted in 2004 indicated that 72 of fulltime faculty identify as liberal117 while 9–18 selfidentify as conservative conservative selfidentification is higher in twoyear colleges than other categories of higher education but has been declining overall118 those in natural sciences engineering and business were less liberal than those in the social sciences and humanities a 2005 study found that liberal views had increased compared to the older studies 15 in the survey described themselves as centerright while the humanities and the social sciences are still the most left leaning 67 of those in other fields combined described themselves as centerleft on the spectrum in business and engineering liberals outnumber conservatives by a 21 ratio the study also found that women practicing christians and republicans taught at lower ranked schools than would be expected from objectively measured professional accomplishments119120 a study by psychologists yoel inbar and joris lammars of the netherlands tilburg university published in september 2012 in the journal perspectives on psychological science found that in social and personality psychology121 about a third of those surveyed say that they would to a small extent favor a liberal point of view over a conservative point of view122 a 2007 poll found that 58 of americans thought that college professors political bias was a serious problem this varied depending on the political views of those asked 91 of very conservative adults agreed compared with only 3 of liberals123 that same year a documentary indoctrinate u was released which focuses on the perceived bias within academia124125126 on the other hand liberal critic paul krugman wrote in the new york times that this phenomenon is more due to personal choice than some kind of discrimination or conspiracy noting that for example vocations such as military officers are much more likely to be filled by conservatives rather than liberals127 additionally two studies published in the journal of the american political science association have suggested that the political orientations of college students professors have little influence or indoctrination in terms of students political belief128 relativism versus universal truthsedit postmodernism is an approach common in the humanities on campus that greatly troubles conservative intellectuals129130 the issue is relativism versus absolute truths ellen grigsby says postmodern perspectives contend that any ideology putting forward absolute statements as timeless truths should be viewed with profound skepticism131 kellner says postmodern discourse frequently argues that all discourses and values are socially constructed and laden with interests and biases against postmodern and liberal relativism cultural conservatives have argued for values of universal truth and absolute standards of right and wrong132 neoconservative historian gertrude himmelfarb has energetically rejected postmodern academic approaches postmodernism in history is a denial of the objectivity of the historian of the factuality or reality of the past and thus of the possibility of arriving at any truths about the past for all disciplines it induces a radical skepticism relativism and subjectivism that denies not this or that truth about any subject but the very idea of truth—that denies even the ideal of truth truth is something to aspire to even if it can never be fully attained133 here is a representative summary of postmodern literary studies of the sort that antagonize conservatives written by jay stevenson in the postmodern period traditional literature has been found to have been written by dead white males to serve the ideological aims of a conservative and repressive anglo hegemonyin an array of reactions against the race gender and class biases found to be woven into the tradition of anglo lit multicultural writers and political literary theorists have sought to expose resist and redress injustices and prejudices these prejudices are often covert—disguised in literature and other discourses as positive ideals and objective truths—but they slant our sense of reality in favor of power and privilege134 conservative intellectuals have championed a high conservative modernism that insists that universal truths exist and have opposed approaches that deny the existence of universal truths135 many argued that natural law was the repository of timeless truths136 allan bloom in his highly influential the closing of the american mind 1987 argues that moral degradation results from ignorance of the great classics that shaped western culture his book was widely cited by conservative intellectuals for its argument that the classics contained universal truths and timeless values which were being ignored by cultural relativists137138 historiographyedit historians in recent years have agreed that they need to rethink the role of conservatism in recent american history139 an important new approach rejects the older consensus that liberalism was the dominant ethos labor historians jefferson cowie and nick salvatore argue the new deal was a shortterm response to depression and did not mark a permanent commitment to a welfare state claiming that america has always been too individualistic and too hostile to labor unions to ever embrace liberalism for any extended period of time this new interpretation argues that conservatism has largely dominated american politics since the 1920s with the brief exceptions of the new deal era 1933–38 and the great society 1964–66140 zelizer however argues that the coherence of conservatism has been exaggerated the movement was as fragile as the new deal coalition that it replacedpolicy change has thus proved to be much more difficult than conservatives hoped for141 zelizer does find four areas where conservatives did make major changes retrenchment of domestic programs lowering taxes deregulation and opposition to labor unions he concludes the fact is that liberalism survived the rise of conservatism142 american exceptionalismedit main article american exceptionalism american conservatives typically promote american exceptionalism the idea that the united states is inherently different from other nations and has a duty to take the lead in spreading democracy and free markets to the world reagan especially articulated this role and many liberals also agree with it143144 they see american values emerging from the american revolution thereby becoming what political scientist seymour martin lipset called the first new nation145 and developing a uniquely american ideology americanism based on liberty egalitarianism individualism republicanism democracy laissezfaire capitalism and judeochristian values146147 although the term does not necessarily imply superiority many neoconservative and other american conservative writers have promoted its use in that sense148149 to them the us is like the biblical city upon a hill—a phrase evoked by puritan settlers in massachusetts as early as 1630—and exempt from historical forces that have affected other countries150 scholars have argued that british and european conservatism has little or no relevance to american traditions according to political scientist louis hartz because the united states skipped the feudal stage of history the american community was united by liberal principles and the conflict between the whig and democratic parties were conflicts within a liberal framework151 in this view what is called conservatism in america is not european conservatism with its royalty landowning aristocracy elite officer corps and established churches but rather 19th century classical liberalism with an emphasis on economic freedom and entrepreneurship152 this is in contrast to the view that burkean conservatism has a set of universal principles which can be applied all societies153 russell kirk in the conservative mind argued that the american revolution was a conservative reaction in the english political tradition against royal innovation51 liberal historian richard hofstader criticized modern american conservatives as pseudoconservatives because their negative reaction to the policies of harry truman showed dissatisfaction with american life traditions and institutions and because they had little in common with the temperate and compromising spirit of true conservatism154 thinkers and leadersedit see also list of american conservatives john c calhoun rossiters giantsedit clinton rossiter a leading expert on american political history published his history of conservatism in america 1956 and also a summary article on the giants of american conservatism in american heritage155 his goal was to identify the great men who did conservative deeds thought conservative thoughts practiced conservative virtues and stood for conservative principles to rossiter conservatism was defined by the rule of the upper class he wrote the right of these freewheeling decades was a genuine right it was led by the rich and wellplaced it was skeptical of popular government it was opposed to all parties unions leagues or other movements that sought to invade its positions of power and profit it was politically socially and culturally antiradical his giants of american conservatism were john adams alexander hamilton john marshall daniel webster john c calhoun elihu root and theodore roosevelt he added that washington and lincoln transcend the usual categories but that conservatives may argue with some conviction that washington and lincoln can also be added to his list rossiter went to note the importance of other conservative leaders over the past two centuries among the fathers of the constitution which he calls a triumph of conservative statesmanship rossiter said conservatives may take special pride in james madison james wilson roger sherman john dickinson gouverneur morris and the pinckneys of south carolina for the early 19th century rossiter said the libertarians and constitutionalists who deserve the conservative spotlight for their fight against jacksonian democracy include joseph story and josiah quincy in massachusetts chancellor james kent in new york james madison james monroe and john randolph of roanoke in virginia in the decades around 1900 rossiter finds that grover cleveland elihu root william howard taft and theodore roosevelt were most successful in shaping the old truths of conservatism to the new facts of industrialism and democracy writing in 1955 he suggests that robert a taft charles evans hughes and dwight d eisenhower may someday be added to the list in the 21st century the american conservative movement has seen new leaders emerge including political commentators politicians radio hosts television hosts and authors such as glenn beck george w bush
