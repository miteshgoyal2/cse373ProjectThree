minnesota the altright or alternative right is a loosely defined group of people with farright ideologies who reject mainstream conservatism in favor of white nationalism white supremacist1 richard spencer initially promoted the term in 2010 in reference to a movement centered on white nationalism and did so according to the associated press to disguise overt racism white supremacism neofascism and neonazism234 the term drew considerable media attention and controversy during and after the 2016 united states presidential election5 altright beliefs have been described as isolationist protectionist antisemitic and white supremacist678 frequently overlapping with neonazism9101112 nativism and islamophobia1314151617 antifeminism misogyny and homophobia918192012 rightwing populism2122 and the neoreactionary movement623 the concept has further been associated with several groups such as american nationalists and monarchists mens rights advocates and the 2016 presidential campaign of donald trump1322232425 the altright has its roots on internet websites such as 4chan and 8chan where anonymous members create and use internet memes to express their ideologies61126 it is difficult to tell how much of what people write in these venues is serious and how much is intended to provoke outrage2127 members of the altright use websites like alternative right twitter breitbart and reddit to convey their message2829 altright postings generally support the policies of donald trump and mike pence30313233 and oppose immigration multiculturalism and political correctness101834 the altright has also had a significant influence on conservative thought in the united states such as the sailer strategy for winning political support along with having close ties to the trump administration it has been listed as a key reason for trumps win in the 2016 election3536 the trump administration includes several figures who are associated with the altright such as former white house chief

the altright in november 2008 selfdescribed paleoconservative philosopher paul gottfried addressed the h l mencken club about what he called the alternative right39 this was republished in december under the title the decline and rise of the alternative right40 in the conservative takis magazine making this the earliest published usage of the phrase in its current context according to slate in 2009 two more posts at takis magazine by patrick j ford and jack hunter further discussed the alternative right41 however the term is most commonly attributed to richard b spencer president of the national policy institute and founder of alternative right214243 beliefs the associated press stated the altright or alternative right is a name currently embraced by some white supremacists and white nationalists to refer to themselves and their ideology which emphasizes preserving and protecting the white race in the united states in addition to or over other traditional conservative positions such as limited government low taxes and strict lawandorder the movement has been described as a mix of racism white nationalism and populism criticizes multiculturalism and more rights for nonwhites women jews muslims gays immigrants and other minorities its members reject the american democratic ideal that all should have equality under the law regardless of creed gender ethnic origin or race244 there is no formal organization and it is not clear if the altright can be considered a movement45 according to a 2016 description in the columbia journalism review because of the nebulous nature of anonymous online communities nobodys entirely sure who the altrighters are and what motivates them its also unclear which among them are true believers and which are smartass troublemakers trying to ruffle feathers27  many of its own proponents often claim they are joking or seeking to provoke an outraged response21 andrew marantz of the new yorker describes it as a label like snob or hipster that is often disavowed by people who exemplify it25 it has been said to include elements of white nationalism91021 white supremacism7834 antisemitism91011 rightwing populism21 nativism13 and the neoreactionary movement23 andrew marantz includes neomonarchists masculinists conspiracists belligerent nihilists25 newsday columnist cathy young noted the altrights strong opposition to both legal and illegal immigration and its hardline stance on the european migrant crisis46 robert tracinski of the federalist has written that the altright opposes miscegenation and advocates collectivism as well as tribalism47 nicole hemmer stated on npr that political correctness is seen by the altright as the greatest threat to their liberty18 milo yiannopoulos claims that some young rebels are drawn to the altright not for deeply political reasons but because it promises fun transgression and a challenge to social norms48 according to the new yorker testing the strength of the speech taboos that revolve around conventional politicsof what can be said and how directly is a major component of altright identity48  the beliefs that make the altright perceptible as a movement are in their essence not matters of substance but of style and the altrights tone may just be concealing a more familiar politics48 ties to white nationalism white supremacist1495051 richard spencer coined the term in 2010 in reference to a movement centered on white nationalism and has been accused by some media publications of doing so to excuse overt racism white supremacism and neonazism24525354 spencer has described the altright as “identity politics for white americans and for europeans around the world55 while the label of white nationalism is disputed by some political commentators including allum bokhari and milo yiannopoulos56 altright figures such as andrew anglin of neonazi website the daily stormer and marcus halberstram of fash the nation have embraced the term as the core philosophy their movement is based on5758 in response to a washington post article that portrayed the movement as offensiveness for the sake of offensiveness anglin said no it isnt the goal is to ethnically cleanse white nations of nonwhites and establish an authoritarian government many people also believe that the jews should be exterminated5960 antifeminism the altright is often described as misogynistic and supporting an antiwoman view18 opposition to feminism and intersectionality are common61 the altright has a significant overlap in supporters with the mens rights movement24 according to the daily stormer as with the claim that all races are equal the claim that men and women are equal is looked at as entirely ridiculous by the altright we believe in abolishing feminism and reestablishing traditional gender roles in society a process which would involve sending women back to the home to produce and raise children largely removing them from the workplace history jared taylor a prominent white nationalist is a figure in the altright community according to economist jeffrey tucker of the foundation for economic education the altright inherits a long and dreary tradition of thought from friedrich hegel to thomas carlyle to oswald spengler to madison grant to othmar spann to giovanni gentile to trumps speeches he states that altright proponents look back to what they imagine to be a golden age when elites ruled and peons obeyed and believe that identity is everything and the loss of identity is the greatest crime against self anyone can imagine62 in march 2016 breitbart news writers allum bokhari and milo yiannopoulos published a piece on the altright which cnn described as being similar to a manifesto63 in that article they described the altright as being derived from the old right of the united states as well from various new right movements of europe citing the movement has been influenced by oswald spengler henry louis mencken julius evola and modern influences such as paleoconservatives patrick j buchanan and samuel t francis56 jeet heer of the new republic likewise identifies the altright as having ideological origins among paleoconservatives particularly with respect to its positions restricting immigration and supporting an openly nationalistic foreign policy6465 an analysis by the guardian described the ethnonationalism of the new right as the altrights progenitor2266 writing in the washington post matthew sheffield said the altright has also been influenced by anarchocapitalist and paleolibertarian theorist murray rothbard specifically in regards to his theorizing on race and democracy and had previously rallied behind ron paul in 200867 anarchocapitalist jeffrey tucker has said the altright is opposed to libertarianism because the altright focuses on group identity and tribalism instead of individual liberty62 american professor and scholar benjamin r teitelbaum compares the altright in the united states to identitarianism in europe and notes that both were influenced by thinkers in the french new right or nouvelle droite68 notable current promoters of altright ideology include vox day69 steve sailer70 richard spencer71 and brittany pettibone72 trump presidential campaign the term drew considerable media attention and controversy during the 2016 presidential election particularly after trump appointed breitbart news chair steven bannon as ceo of the trump campaign in august steve bannon referred to breitbart news as the platform for the altright38 the altright was exceedingly vocal in support for donald trumps 2016 presidential campaign217330313233 during the campaign hillary clinton attacked the altright as racist ideas antimuslim antiimmigrant antiwomen ideas and accused trump of taking the altright mainstream74 media attention grew after the election particularly during a postelection celebratory meeting near the white house hosted by richard spencer spencer used several nazi propaganda terms during a meeting and closed with hail trump hail our people hail victory in response supporters of spencer gave the nazi salute and chanted in a similar fashion to the sieg heil chant used at the nuremberg rallies spencer defended the conduct stating that the nazi salute was given in a spirit of irony and exuberance7576 following the episode the associated press described the altright label as currently embraced by some white supremacists and white nationalists that may exist primarily as a publicrelations device to make its supporters actual beliefs less clear and more acceptable to a broader audience the ap said that it has previously called such beliefs racist neonazi or white supremacist2 reactions part of a series on conservatism variants

criticized it as racist or hateful4677 particularly given its hostility towards mainstream liberalism and conservatism7879 in the federalist conservative political scientist nathanael blake stated that christianity and grecoroman philosophy rather than race are the foundations upon which western civilization was built and that the altright is actually attacking western civilization rather than defending it80 writing for national review david a french called altright proponents wannabe fascists and bemoaned their entry into the national political conversation81 writing for the weekly standard benjamin welton instead described the altright as a highly heterogeneous force that turns the lefts moralism on its head and makes it a badge of honor to be called racist homophobic and sexist82 writing for the new yorker benjamin wallacewells described it as a loosely assembled farright movement but said that its differences from the conventional rightwing in american politics are more a matter of style than of substance one way to understand the altright is not as a movement but as a collective experiment in identity in the same way that many people use anonymity on the internet to test more extreme versions of themselves21 professor george hawley of the university of alabama suggested that the altright may pose a greater threat to progressivism than the mainstream conservative movement83 in an interview with the new york times on november 22 presidentelect donald trump disavowed and condemned the altright84 to the dismay of many of his altright supporters85 in december 2016 artist arrington de dionyso whose murals are frequently displayed at the comet ping pong pizzeria described the altrights online campaign of harassment against him in detail86 and averred of the attacks in general i think its a very deliberate assault which will eventually be a coordinated assault on all forms of free expression the pizzagate conspiracy theory has drawn comparisons with the gamergate controversy87 a wave of threats against jewish community centers starting in 2017 were blamed on the altright in a january 2017 article by slates elissa strauss who said members of the altright viewed them as a practical joke88 the activist group stop normalizing which opposes the normalization of terms like altright developed the stop normalizing alt right chrome extension the extension went viral shortly after the release of stop normalizings website89 the extension changes the term altright on webpages to white supremacy9091929394 the extension and group were founded by a new yorkbased advertising and media professional under the pseudonym george zola95 in 2017 reddit banned the raltright subreddit for violating its antidoxxing policy9697 many altright populist media figures criticized trumps 2017 shayrat missile strike reversal of policy towards war in syria and the middle east9899100101 ann coulter pointed out that trump campaigned on not getting involved in mideast and this was one of the reasons many voted for him98 102103104105 commentary in national review in april 2016 ian tuttle wrote the altright has evangelized over the last several months primarily via a racist and antisemitic online presence but for allum bokhari and milo yiannopoulos the altright consists of funloving provocateurs valiant defenders of western civilization daring intellectuals—and a handful of neonazis keen on a final solution 20 but there are only a few of them and nobody likes them anyways106 bokhari and yiannopoulos describe jared taylor founder of american renaissance and richard b spencer founder of alternative right as representative of intellectuals in the altright56106 writing in the federalist cathy young stated that the website radix journal had replaced the alternative right website and describes a radix journal article on abortion which proclaimed that the prolife position is dysgenic since it encourages breeding by the least intelligent and responsible women107 kevin b macdonald is also mentioned as an altright thinker2 in newsday young called the altright a nest of antisemitism inhabited by white supremacists who regularly use repulsive bigotry46 chris hayes on all in with chris hayes described altright as a euphemistic term for essentially modernday white supremacy108 buzzfeed reporter rosie gray described the altright as white supremacy perfectly tailored for our times saying that it uses aggressive rhetoric and outright racial and antisemitic slurs and that it has more in common with european farright movements than american ones109110 writing for haaretz yishai schwartz described the altright as vitriolically antisemitic by saying that the alternative that the altright presents is in large part an alternative to acceptance of jews and warned that it must be taken seriously as a threat111 also writing for haaretz chemi shalev has observed that altright supporters of trump despise jewish liberals with same venom that israeli right detests jewish leftists112 breitbart news has become a popular outlet for altright views113114115 on august 25 2016 democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton gave a speech accusing republican candidate donald trump of helping a radical fringe take over the republican party116 she identified this radical fringe with the altright and noted that trumps campaign chief executive steve bannon has described his breitbart news network as the platform for the altright38 some members of the group were delighted and described clintons speech as free publicity noted that google searches peaked afterward and suggested that millions of people were hearing of the movement for the very first time117 on september 9 several figures of the altright community held a press conference described by one reporter as the comingout party of the littleknown movement to explain their goals118 they proclaimed racialist beliefs by stating race is real race matters and race is the foundation of identity119 speakers called for a white homeland and expounded on racial differences in intelligence they also confirmed their support of trump by saying this is what a leader looks like119120121 use of memes the altrights use of internet memes to express and advance its beliefs often on websites such as 4chan 8chan and the daily stormer has been widely reported1126122123 among the most widely used are the following terms cuckservative a portmanteau of cuckold and conservative124125 triple parentheses or echoes to identify and target jews online which originated on the neonazi podcast the daily shoah711126127 variations of the pepe the frog and emperor trump memes popular in altright circles128 leading to references of nazi frogs in the media129130 these variants of the pepe the frog meme attracted significant media attention after the meme was criticized in an article published on hillary clintons campaign website131132 satirical worship of the ancient egyptian deity kek has become associated with altright politics as well as satirical nationalism of the nonexistent nation of kekistan133134135 the use of altright music such as trumpwave and fashwave which is a rightwing subgenre of vaporwave136 the use of deus vult and various other crusader iconography as a means of expressing islamophobia127137138 ironic support of the black egyptian hypothesis often using stereotypical africanamerican vernacular such as we wuz kangz n shieet139 the use of the phrase dindu nuffin a bastardization of didnt do nothing in reference to claims of innocence for africanamerican victims of police violence especially about eric garner and michael brown140 usage of helicopter ride memes which endorse documented cases of leftists being dropped from helicopters by chilean and argentine juntas141 the prevalence of memes in altright circles has led some commentators to question whether the altright is a serious movement rather than just an alternative way to express traditionally conservative beliefs1121 with chava gourarie of the columbia journalism review stating that provoking a media reaction to these memes is for some creators an end in itself27 marc hetherington professor of political science at vanderbilt university sees these memes as an effort to legitimize racist views142 altleft altleft is a term used by some conservatives to refer to people and social activist groups aligned to the left of the political centerleft as a contrast to the farright the term became known for its use by president donald trump in an august 15 2017 press conference at new york citys trump tower143 while doublingdown on his initial statement in response to the vehicleramming attack against rally counterprotestors committed by a 20yearold white nationalist during the august 12 unite the right rally in charlottesville virginia in which he stated that there was blame on both sides for the violence at the rally trump criticized what he called the very very violent altleft contrasting them with the altright144145146 its usage later spread around some conservative circles after its use by fox news channel host sean hannity to suggest the existence of a similar ideological fringe movement on the political left147148149 according to george hawley an assistant professor of political science at the university of alabama no such label has been adopted by any members of the progressive left148150 both the term itself and the concept of an altleft as an oppositebutequal mirror of the altright have generated controversy for likening the socialist critics of neonazism to neonazis151152153 the term has also been criticized as a label that unlike altright was not coined by the group it purports to describe but rather was created by political opponents as a political smear implying a false equivalence152147 while acknowledging that there are antifascism activists on the left who engage in physical confrontation against members of the farright oren segal director of the antidefamation leagues center on extremism concurred that no equivalent to those who identify as being part of the altright exists stating that antifascist groups were not consciously aiming to brand themselves in the manner that white supremacists neonazis and other members of the farright had undertaken to mainstream their ideology148 according to mark pitcavage an analyst at the anti defamation league the term was invented to suggest a false equivalence between the altright and their opponents154 the washington post stated the term originated on websites promoting conspiracy theories such as worldnetdaily155 in a los angeles times article historian timothy d snyder stated that altright is a term meant to provide a fresh label that would sound more attractive than nazi neonazi white supremacist or white nationalist with altleft its a different story there is no group that labels itself that way there are a few people who have decided to resist nazis with violence but they are not representative of the much larger group of americans who oppose racism156 professor thomas j main commented on the altright by saying they dont think blacks and jews should have equal rights on the left there is nothing analogous156 washington post writer aaron blake says that unlike the altright altleft was coined by its opponents
