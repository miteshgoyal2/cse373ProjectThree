successor gerald ford of michigan it was the fifth time nixon had been nominated on the republican ticket as either its vicepresidential 1952 and 1956 or presidential candidate 1960 and 1968 hence nixons five appearances on his partys ticket matched the majorparty american standard of franklin d roosevelt a democrat who had been nominated for vice president once in 1920 and president four times

center was the site of the 1972 republican national convention san diego california had originally been selected as host city for the convention columnist jack anderson however discovered a memo written by dita beard a lobbyist for the international telephone and telegraph corp suggesting the company pledge 400000 toward the san diego bid in return for the us department of justice settling its antitrust case against itt1 fearing scandal and citing labor and cost concerns the gop transferred the event—scarcely three months before it was to begin—to miami beach which was also hosting the democratic national convention it was the sixth and to date last time both the republican and democratic national party conventions were held in the same city chicago had hosted double conventions in 1884 1932 1944 and 1952 and philadelphia in 19482 the rnc did not return to san diego until 1996 speechesedit the convention set a new standard as it was scripted as a media event to an unprecedented degree3 the keynote address by anne armstrong of texas was the first national convention keynote delivered by a woman4 first lady pat nixon addresses the convention she was the first first lady since eleanor roosevelt to address a party convention and the first republican first lady to do what is now considered common practice first lady pat nixon became the first republican first lady and the first first lady in over 25 years to address a partys national convention her speech set the standard for future convention speeches by political spouses first ladies nancy reagan barbara bush laura bush and melania trump among others have all followed in this tradition ballotingedit nixon easily turned back primary challenges from the right in the person of us representative john m ashbrook of ohio and from the left representative pete mccloskey of california however under new mexico state law mccloskey had earned one delegate which the convention refused to seat fearing that the delegate might put mccloskeys name in nomination and give an antiwar speech us representative and delegate manuel lujan of new mexico a staunch nixon supporter decided to honor state law by voting for mccloskey himself the final result was that nixon received 1347 votes to one for mccloskey and none for ashbrook throughout the precisely scripted convention delegates chanted four more years four more years5 spiro agnew was renominated for vice president with 1345 votes against one vote for television journalist david brinkley and two abstentionscitation needed the nbc network for which brinkley worked had some brinkley for vice president buttons made which the news team wore as a jokecitation needed protest activityedit the convention was targeted for widespread protests particularly against the vietnam war and the nixon administration made efforts to suppress it this tension was captured by top value television in the independent documentary four more years which juxtaposes shots of the protests outside the convention with the internal politics of the convention in 2005 files released under a freedom of information act lawsuit showed that the federal bureau of investigation even monitored former beatle john lennon after he was invited to play for yippie protests the monitoring of lennon later concluded that he was not a dangerous revolutionary being constantly under the influence of narcoticscitation needed the us justice department indicted scott camil john kniffen alton foss donald perdue william patterson stan michelsen peter mahoney and john briggs—collectively known as the gainesville eight—on charges of conspiracy to disrupt the convention all were exonerated oliver stones film born on the fourth of july based on ron kovics autobiography of the same name depicts kovic and fellow vietnam veterans against the war activists bobby muller bill wieman and mark clevinger being spat upon at the convention6 the scene was actually not in kovics autobiography but was taken almost frame for frame and word by word from a documentary film made at the 1972 republican convention in miami 1972 titled operation last patrol by filmmaker
