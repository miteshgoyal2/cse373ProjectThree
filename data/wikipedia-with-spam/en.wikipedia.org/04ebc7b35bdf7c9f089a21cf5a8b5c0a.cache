metropolitan seattle was created by a local referendum in 1958 authorized to manage regional wastewater and water quality issues in king county6 after two failed attempts to enable it to build a regional rapid transit system it was authorized to operate a regional bus system in 1972 the bus system was known as metro transit and began operations in 1973 its operations subsumed the seattle transit system formerly under the purview of the city of seattle and the metropolitan transit corporation a private company serving suburban cities in king county in the early 1970s the private metropolitan faced bankruptcy because of low ridership king county voters authorized metro to buy metropolitan and operate the countys mass transit bus system the municipality of metropolitan seattle was overseen by a federated board of elected officials composed of elected officials from cities throughout the region its representation structure was ruled unconstitutional in 199078 in 1992 after gaining approval by popular vote the municipalitys roles and authorities were assumed by the government of king county6 the municipalitys transit operations was a standalone department within the county until 1996 when it became a division of the newly created king county department of transportation after completion of the downtown seattle transit tunnel project attention was drawn again to developing a regional rail system this interest led to the formation of the central puget sound regional transit authority more commonly known as sound transit which holds primary responsibility for planning and building high capacity transit in the counties of king pierce and snohomish in western washington state9 today king county metro operates more than 200 routes providing local and regional transit service primarily within its jurisdictional boundaries besides its own transit operations metro operates several st express bus routes and the central link light rail line under a contract with sound transit10 and two streetcar routes under contract with seattle streetcar ride free areaedit for almost 40 years until 201211 most of downtown seattle was designated as a zerofare zone an area in which all rides on metro vehicles were free known as the ride free area intended to encourage transit usage improve accessibility and encourage downtown shopping the zone was created in september 1973 and was originally called the magic carpet zone1213 it was later renamed the ride free area rfa the rfa extended from the north at battery st to s jackson st on the south and east at 6th avenue to the waterfront on the west14 until 1987 the zone was in effect 24 hours a day but in october of that year metro began requiring fare payment within the zone during nighttime hours between 9 pm and 4 am to reduce farerelated conflicts that sometimes led to assaults on drivers15 in february 1994 the rfas hours were reduced further with fare payment required between 7 pm and 6 am16 a king county auditor’s office report released in september 2009 found that metro “can neither fully explain nor provide backup documentation for the operating cost savings that offset the fare revenues in the calculation of the annual charges to the city of seattle for the city’s ride free area” and that some assumptions in the methodology metro used to calculate the amount of lost fares were “questionable” and have not been updated to reflect changes to the fare structure and fare collection methods17 a 1975 study found that while the ride free area generally reduced bus travel times within the rfa itself buses that traveled through the ride free area to other destinations generally did not benefit it also found that unloading outbound coaches once outside the rfa took additional time though not entirely quantified visàvis time saved within the rfacitation needed on september 29 2012 the ride free area was eliminated all riders boarding in downtown must now pay as they board11 operationsedit metro buses in downtown seattle routesedit see also list of king county metro bus routes metro combines service patterns typical of both city and suburban bus networks the city network was descended in large part from the seattle transit system of converted streetcar routes most service is operated in a hubandspoke pattern centered either on downtown seattle or the university of washington with lesser amounts of crosstown service the suburban network typically operates on major streets between the regions employment and population centers routes in the city network are numbered from 1 to 78 because of the scattershot evolution of the system there is no easily discernible pattern to the route numbers although there are clusters in certain neighborhoods the incity routes with the highest ridership are the rapidride d line from downtown to crown hill via uptownseattle center and ballard the 7 traveling from downtown through the international district to the rainier valley the 40 traveling from downtown through south lake union fremont and ballard to northgate the 41 traveling from downtown via i5 to northgate and lake city the rapidride c line from south lake union and downtown to west seattles alaska junction and westwood village the 36 traveling from downtown through the international district to beacon hill the 5 from downtown via the woodland park zoo and greenwoodphinney ridge to shoreline community college the 44 a crosstown route connecting the university district and ballard the 8 a crosstown route connecting uptownseattle center and south lake union with capitol hill the central district and mount baker and the 70 connecting downtown to south lake union eastlake and the university district the metrooperated seattle streetcar routes are numbered in the 90s with the south lake union streetcar numbered 98 and the bus replacement for the waterfront streetcar numbered 99 the suburban system is more numerically organized roughly speaking areas in south king county from burien and des moines through renton and maple valley are served by routes numbered in the 100s areas in east king county from renton to bothell are served by routes numbered in the 200s areas in north king county from bothell to shoreline are served by routes numbered in the 300s major allday metro routes in the suburbs include the rapidride e line connecting downtown seattle and shorelines aurora village tc the 120 connecting seattle and burien the 372x connecting the university district lake city and uw bothell the 150 connecting seattle southcenter and kent the 255 connecting seattle and kirkland the 271 connecting issaquah bellevue and the university district the 101 and 106 between seattle and renton the 240 connecting renton and bellevue and the 347 and 348 connecting northgate and north city the metrooperated sound transit express routes are numbered in the 500s route numbers in the lower 900s 901–931 are used for dialaride services while shuttles connecting to the king county water taxi are numbered in the 700s metro is contracted to operate special custom buses custom routes that serve schools in bellevue and on mercer island are numbered in the 800s 823 824 886–892 and routes serving the private lakeside school and university prep numbered in the higher 900s 980–995 metro also operates custom routes to major employment sites like group health cooperative in tukwila and the boeing everett factory custom routes are also occasionally established to serve as shuttles for large local events including seattle seahawks and washington huskies football games rapidrideedit main article rapidride rapidride bus running on the c line in west seattle king county metro operates rapidride a network of limitedstop bus lines with some bus rapid transit features all rapidride routes have frequent service with frequencies of 10 minutes or better during peak commuting hours and 15 minutes during most offpeak hours and on weekends most lines except the b and f lines have late night and early morning service stops are placed farther apart than typical metro service to increase speed and reliability stops with heavier ridership have stations with an awning seating lighting real time information signs to communicate estimate arrival times of rapidride buses most stations and some stops in downtown seattle have orca card readers that allow passengers to pay before the bus arrives and board at any of the buses three doors18 all lines use new lowfloor articulated buses that are painted with a distinct red and yellow livery and have onboard wifi the rapidride corridors are a line tukwila – federal way b line redmond – overlake – bellevue c line west seattle – downtown seattle – south lake union d line ballard – uptown – downtown seattle e line shoreline – downtown seattle f line burien – southcenter – renton freeway express servicesedit metro operates many peakhour commuter routes serving park and rides that use 24452 miles of the regions network of high occupancy vehicle hov lanes19 this practice was pioneered at seattle transit as the blue streak express bus service running between northgate park ride and downtown seattle special stops called freeway flyers or freeway stations were constructed to allow efficient transfer between local and express buses20 the first freeway flyer stop opened in 1975 at montlake boulevard and state route 52021 metro also takes advantage of new hov directaccess ramps and freeway stations constructed by sound transit to improve speed and reliability of its commuter routes2223 skipstop spacingedit metro uses skipstop spacing on 2nd 3rd and 4th avenues in downtown seattle whereby buses skip every other bus stop on 3rd avenue each bus route is assigned to blue yellow red or green stop groups and each bus stop has two color designations in the northbound direction every other bus stop is a redyellow or greenblue stop while in the southbound direction they are greenyellow and redblue on 2nd and 4th avenues routes are grouped into orange and white stops the bus stop color groupings are identified by a colored plate installed above or on the side of the bus stop sign on 3rd avenue only there are additional colored markers one block ahead of each bus stop on the trolley overhead wires to help bus drivers identify the colors of the upcoming bus stop24 night owl servicesedit metro operates a network of 18 routes with latenight night owl service which is defined as having regular service between midnight and 5 am25 the night owl network is made up of some of metro’s most popular routes and is designed to connect neighborhoods with major transportation hubs including downtown seattle sea–tac airport park ride lots transit centers and link stations providing service during the hours when trains are not in service the city of seattles transportation benefit district funds service on night owl routes that operate entirely within the city limits26

to reflect recent events or newly available information may 2015 the cost per boarding for metro was 410 in 2005 compared to 250 among the countrys 15 largest transit agencies and 297 the national average metros cost per boarding is 38 above the national average27 metros higherthanaverage cost per boarding can be at least partially attributed to its high percentage of commuter routes which run at peak hours only and often only in one direction at a time as of 2011 100 of metros 223 routes are peakonly these routes require significant deadheading particularly on the oneway routes as well as a very large parttime labor force both of which drive up costs28 metros lowestcost route overall route 4 east queen anne to judkins park had a cost per boarding of only 046 during peak hours in 2009

downtown seattle transit tunnel university street station a major metro facility is the downtown seattle transit tunnel dstt a 13milelong fivestation tunnel that allows seven bus routes and central link light rail trains to travel under the heart of downtown seattle the tunnel was completed in 1990 at a cost of 455 million33 while it was planned from the outset to be convertible to use by trains the tunnel began operation with a fleet of 236 breda dualmode buses that operated using a diesel motor on city streets and an electric motor with power fed by overhead trolley wire in the tunnel in 2004 metro switched to hybridelectric buses that operate in a mostly electric hush mode while in the tunnel the tunnel was closed between fall 2005 and fall 2007 to prepare it for light rail trains34 crews lowered the roadway to match the height of central links lowfloor light rail vehicles replaced the overhead trolley wire with catenary wire and built a stub tunnel where trains could reverse direction and allowed for construction of the university link extension to the north which was completed in 2016 the tunnel finished its retrofit and returned to service on september 24 200734 and light rail trains began service on july 18 2009 bus service in the tunnel could end as soon as 201935 a project to expand the washington state convention center will prevent buses from being able to access or layover at the north end of the tunnel at that point the tunnel will be used exclusively by light rail trains as of september 10 2016 the following routes operate in the downtown seattle

executive ron sims announced a program entitled transit now that once approved by voters would provide for a 20 percent increase in transit service by the end of 2016 over 2006 service levels measured in annual operating hours in order to realize this growth transit now proposed an increase in the local option sales tax for transit of onetenth of one percent the transit now ordinance38 passed by the king county council on september 5 2006 and signed by executive sims on september 11 2006 forwarded the tax proposition to the voters and identified the programs to which operating revenue generated from the sales tax increase could be appropriated the measure was approved by 5662 of king county voters in the november 2007 general election the service programs identified in the ordinance are as follows implementation of rapidride routes in five arterial corridors increase service on highridership routes that provide frequent twoway connections throughout the agencys service area service for growing areas in outlying suburbanexurban areas partnerships with cities and major employers to provide more service than could otherwise be provided through typical resources additional improvements such as expanded rideshare and paratransit services in king county proposition 1edit in november 2014 seattle voters passed proposition 1 with 59 support it uses 45 million in new annual funds from a 01 sales tax raise and a 60 annual cartab fee to add king county metro bus service within the city of seattle39 intelligent transportation systems itsedit collaborating with several local jurisdictions metro was an early adopter of transit signal priority tsp a system that can extend green lights to allow buses to get through the system can boost average speeds as much as 8 and is in use on several of the citys busiest corridors including aurora avenue north rainier avenue s and lake city way ne40 the system uses rfid tags that are read as buses approach a tsp equipped intersection in 1998 the fleet was updated with an automatic vehicle location avl system that utilizes batterypowered beacons that read the rfid tags and communicate the buses location to metro in 2010 the avl system was replaced with a gpsbased system as part of a systemwide radio update41 as a part of the radio update metro also added automated next stop signs and announcements to all buses42 in 2010 metro rolled out a new ip network based its infrastructure for its rapidride service buses will communicate with roadside equipment using 80211 wireless technology on the 49 ghz public safety band a fiber optic backhaul connects access points and roadside equipment together to metros communication center the system will extend the legacy rfidbased tsp system it will also be used in conjunction with gps technology to provide frequent and accurate location updates for next bus arrival signs at rapidride stations the extent of metros application of intelligent transportation systems its for transit information available for customers has been limited to a few projects an early project called mybus by the university of washington uw utilized the tracking data to provide realtime bus information this is now hosted by metro under the name tracker an improved version of mybus called onebusaway developed by a uw graduate student combines tracker information with google maps the android version of onebusaway was developed by paul watts a seattle entrepreneur and programmer transit watch displays like those found in airports and major train stations are installed at some transit centers and transfer points to show realtime bus arrival information a pilot project provided bus information displays along a city arterial metro discontinued the project in 2005 citing the cost of maintenance and technical problems43 metro has a regional trip planner that provides itineraries for transit trips within king pierce and snohomish counties including those on sound

largest fleet of buses in the united states with a total of 1540 buses3 the agency has pioneered technologies in widespread use today in 1978 metro was the first large transit agency to order highcapacity articulated buses buses with a rotating joint48 today king county metro has one of the largest articulated fleets in north america second only to mta new york city transit and articulated buses account for about 42 of the agencies fleet2 in 1979 the agency ordered some of the first wheelchair lift equipped coaches in the nation4950 promising a completely new level of independence for disabled residents early lifts were severely flawed but by the mid1980s the lifts were generally reliable and were ordered on all new buses metros entire fleet has been wheelchairaccessible since 1999 metro was reluctant to adopt lowfloor buses not buying any until 2003 lowfloor coaches have slightly reduced seating capacity because the wheelwells intrude further into the passenger compartment which may have been a concern whatever the reason for the delay metro has now embraced lowfloor buses and all new fleet additions since 2003 have been lowfloor and the last highfloor buses are scheduled to be retired in 2018 trolleysedit see also trolleybuses in seattle metros first lowfloor trolleybuses new flyer xcelsior model xt40 vehicles entered service in 2015 metro maintains a fleet

to 3 miles 48 km occasionally metro will use diesel or dieselelectric hybrid coaches on trolley routes reasons for doing this include construction weekends only55 overhead wire maintenance or events that require coaches to go long distances offroute coach changes replacing a bus in service that has developed a problem or to add temporary additional capacity the latter two cases sometimes lead to diesel buses being used in order to get the replacement or supplementary vehicle into service as quickly as possible diesel buses can reach the point of entry into service faster as they do not need

buses in the country the first hybrid buses were purchased in 2004 for use with routes that operated in the downtown seattle transit tunnel56 the national renewable energy laboratory conducted a oneyear comparative study between conventional diesel and hybridpowered buses operating on a typical king county drive cycle results showed that the hybrid powered buses lowered fuel consumption by 23 nox by 18 carbon monoxide co by 60 and total hydrocarbon thc by 56 when compared to conventional diesel buses those results have led metro to purchase hybrid buses exclusively since 2005 with the exception of the allelectric trolley buses5758 metro now has over 700 hybrid buses in the fleet with more on order hush modeedit buses equipped with the gmallison ep50 and the allison h 50 ep parallel hybrid systems have a special hush mode that allows the buses to operate solely on electric power reducing tailpipe emissions and noise while operating in the downtown seattle transit tunnel56 before entering the tunnel the operator pushes a button that puts the coach into hush mode while buses are inside stations the coaches operate solely on electric propulsion although while the doors are closed the engine still rotates in order to operate auxiliary loads in between the tunnels stations the bus uses electric traction to get to 15 mph 24 kmh after which a combination of the electric and diesel motors are used the operation of the diesel engine allows the batteries to recharge hush mode is normally deactivated by the operator as they exit the tunnel but the mode will be automatically deactivated after the coach has traveled a certain distance series hybridsedit orion vii dieselelectric series hybrid bus operated by king county metro metros newest buses are equipped with the bae systems hybridrive a series hybrid system59 in these buses an electric motor turns the wheels with power provided by a generator attached to a diesel engine and regenerative breaking any excess power

with the upgraded hybridrive seriese which uses electrically powered accessory systems alternator air conditioning air compressor cooling fans and steering pump to increase fuel efficiency and allow the diesel engine to stop when the bus is stopped and the batteries are sufficiently charged battery electric busesedit upholding their history of adopting new technologies to help increase efficiency and cut down on emissions metro has begun testing three new proterra catalyst battery electric buses60 the coaches are capable of traveling over 26 miles61 before the battery needs to be recharged a special fast charge station located at the eastgate park and ride allow the bus to be fully recharged in under 10 minutes during the drivers normally scheduled layover62nonprimary source needed these new vehicles get the equivalent of 208 mpg which is over 6 times better than the 318 mpg seen on metros series hybrid electric coaches6364 the coaches were purchased with support from a 47 million federal transit administration grant and entered service on february 17 201665 they will operate from king county metros bellevue base in bellevue and will be tested on shorter routes due to their limited range across the eastside63 this testing will continue for a period of about one year after which metro has the option to purchase up to 200 new vehicles over the following five years66 if the tests are deemed a success battery electric buses could be used to replace the oldest dieselpowered coaches in the fleet metro employees historic vehicle associationedit metro has a special fleet of more than a dozen historic motor buses and trolleybuses ranging from ones built in the late 1930s and early 1940s through to ones only recently retired the coaches are restored maintained and operated under an agreement with the metro employees historic vehicle association mehva a nonprofit organization formed in 198167 metro maintains ownership of the historic fleet providing coverage under its fleet selfinsurance along with storage work space and parts on an as available basis money to operate the coaches and purchase parts not in metro stock is generated by selling tickets to public excursions the first trips took place in 1984 and nowadays mehva typically operates six to eight per year67 each excursion has a different route and a different emphasis mehva was established in 1981 as metro prepared to retire trolleybuses that had been operating in seattle since the 1940s since that time mehva acquired other retired transit vehicles which were formerly operated in king county
