added tax borderadjustment tax united states portal v t e the united states tax court is a federal trial court of record established by congress under article i of the us constitution section 8 of which provides in part that the congress has the power to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme court1 the tax court specializes in adjudicating disputes over federal income tax generally prior to the time at which formal tax assessments are made by the internal revenue service2 though taxpayers may choose to litigate tax matters in a variety of legal settings outside of bankruptcy the tax court is the only forum in which taxpayers may do so without having first paid the disputed tax in full parties who contest the imposition of a tax may also bring an action in any united states district court or in the united states court of federal claims however these venues require that the tax be paid first and that the party then file a lawsuit to recover the contested amount paid the

historyedit president calvin coolidge signing the income tax bill which established the us board of tax appeals andrew mellon is the third figure from the right the first incarnation of the tax court was the us board of tax appeals established by congress in the revenue act of 192456 also known as the mellon tax bill in order to address the increasing complexity of taxrelated litigation those serving on the board were simply designated as members the members of the board were empowered to select on a biennial basis one of their members as chairman7 the board originally had 16 members with charles d hamel serving as the first chairman8 the board was initially established as an independent agency in the executive branch of the government9 it was housed in the internal revenue service building in the federal triangle10 the first session of the board of tax appeals spanned july 16 1924 to may 31 192511 in 1929 the united states supreme court indicated that the board of tax appeals was not a court but was instead an executive or administrative board upon the decision of which the parties are given an opportunity to base a petition for review to the courts after the administrative inquiry of the board has been had and decided12 in 1942 congress passed the revenue act of 1942 renaming the board as the tax court of the united states13 with this change the members became judges and the chairman became the presiding judge by 1956 overcrowding and the desire to separate judicial and executive powers led to initial attempts to relocate the court in 1962 secretary of the treasury douglas dillon appealed to the us general services administration gsa to incorporate funds for the design of a new building in its upcoming budget the gsa allocated 450000 and commissioned renowned architect victor a lundy who produced a design that was approved in 196610 however funding constraints brought on by the vietnam war delayed the start of construction until 197210 the tax court was again renamed to its current formal designation in the tax reform act of 196914 changing it from an historically administrative court to a full judicial court the completed united states tax court building was dedicated on november 22 1974 the fiftieth anniversary of the revenue act that created the court10 in 1991 the us supreme court in freytag v commissioner stated that the current united states tax court is an article i legislative court that exercises a portion of the judicial power of the united states15 the court explained the tax court exercises judicial power to the exclusion of any other function and that it exercises its judicial power in much the same way as the federal district courts exercise theirs16 this exclusively judicial role distinguishes it from other nonarticle iii tribunals that perform multiple functions17 thus freytag concluded that the tax court exercises judicial rather than executive legislative or administrative power18 the tax court remains independent of the executive and legislative branches in the sense that its decisions are not subject to appellate review by congress the president or for that matter article iii district courts17 the president however may remove the tax court judges after notice and opportunity for public hearing for inefficiency neglect of duty or malfeasance in office19 justice scalia penned a separate concurrence for four justices in freytag these justices dissented as to the court majoritys rationale they would have characterized the tax courts power as executive rather than judicial20 scalia said that to him it seemed entirely obvious that the tax court like the internal revenue service the fcc and the nlrb exercises executive power21 notwithstanding scalias sharp dissents in landmark separationofpowers cases such as mistretta v united states22 and morrison v olson23 scalia apparently described freytag as the single worst opinion of his incumbency on the us supreme court24 although the 2008 us government directory of executive and legislative appointed officers the plum book categorized the tax court as part of the legislative branch25 the 2012 revised version removed the tax court and listed it under neither the legislative nor the executive branches26 under an amendment to the internal revenue code of 1986 enacted in late 2015 the us tax court is not an agency of and shall be independent of the executive branch of the government27 however section 7443f of the code still provides that a tax court judge may be removed by the president for inefficiency neglect of duty or malfeasance in office28 jurisdiction of the tax courtedit the tax court provides a judicial forum in which affected persons can dispute tax deficiencies determined by the commissioner of internal revenue prior to payment of the disputed amounts the jurisdiction of the tax court includes but is not limited to the authority to hearcitation needed tax disputes concerning notices of deficiency notices of transferee liability certain types of declaratory judgment readjustment and adjustment of partnership items review of the failure to abate interest administrative costs worker classification relief from joint and several liability on a joint return review of certain collection actions congress amended the internal revenue code now codified in internal revenue code section 7482 providing that decisions of the tax court may be reviewed by the applicable geographical united states court of appeals other than the court of appeals for the federal circuit29 see article i and article iii tribunals small tax cases are conducted under internal revenue code section 7463 and generally involve only amounts in controversy of 50000 or less for any one tax year30 the small tax case procedure is available at the option of the taxpayer30 these cases are neither appealable nor precedential31 at times there have been efforts in the congress and the tax bar to create a single national court of appeals for tax cases or make tax court decisions appealable to a single existing court of appeals to maintain uniformity in the application of the nations tax laws the very reason underlying the creation of the tax court and the grant of national jurisdiction to the tax court but efforts to avoid hometown results or inconsistent results due to a lack of expertise have failedcitation needed an important reason for the movements to create a single national court of appeals for tax cases is that the united states tax court does not have exclusive jurisdiction over tax cases in addition to the tax court federal tax matters can be heard and decided in three other courts us district courts the court of federal claims and the bankruptcy court32 in the first two instances the taxpayer bringing the claim generally must have first paid the deficiency determined by the irs33 for the bankruptcy court the tax matter must of course arise as an issue in a bankruptcy proceeding34 bankruptcy court appeals are initially to the us district court34 appeals beyond the us district courts and the court of federal claims follow the same path as those from the us tax court as described above34 with this number of courts involved in making legal determinations on federal tax matters including all 13 united states courts of appeals exercising appellate jurisdiction the 11 numbered circuits the federal circuit for appeals from the us court of federal claims and the dc circuit some observers express concern that the tax laws can be interpreted differently for like cases thus arises the movement on the part of some for a us court of federal tax appeals though the merits of this are a matter of much discussion35 judgesedit seal of the united states tax court further information list of judges of the united states tax court the tax court is composed of 19 judges appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate36 former judges whose terms have ended may become senior judges able to return and assist the court by hearing cases while serving on recall in addition the court is assisted by a number of special trial judges who are employees of the court appointed by the chief judge of the tax court rather than by the president37 special trial judges serve a function similar to that served by united states magistrate judges of the district courts and may hear cases regarding alleged deficiencies or overpayments of up to 5000038 reappointment when requested by a tax court judge irc 7447b3 is generally pro forma regardless of the political party of the appointing president and the political party of the reappointing sitting presidentcitation needed each active judge appointed by the president has two law clerks attorneyadvisers and each senior judge and special trial judge has one law clerk president george w bush was heavily criticized by the us congress the tax bar and others when he indicated that he likely would not or might not reappoint tax court judges whose terms were expiring even though the first judge whose reappointment president bush called into question judge john o colvin was appointed by president ronald reagancitation needed president bill clinton also was criticized for not acting timely to reappoint tax court judges having allowed one sitting chief judges term to expire thus requiring the tax court to elect a new chief judge additionally several tax court judges had to wait more than a year sometimes more than two years to be reappointed during the clinton presidencycitation needed trial sessions are conducted and other work of the court is performed by its judges by senior judges serving on recall and by special trial judges all of the judges have expertise in the tax laws and are tasked to apply that expertise in a manner to ensure that taxpayers are assessed only what they owe and no more although the principal office of the court is located in the district of columbia tax court judges may sit at any place within the united states39 the judges travel nationwide to conduct trials in various designated cities the work of the tax court has occasionally been interrupted by events in 2001 a trial session in new york city was canceled due to the september 11 terrorist attacks in 2005 stops in miami and new orleans were canceled due to the effects of hurricanes which had struck shortly before their scheduled visit to each citycitation needed the tax courts judges serve 15year terms subject to presidential removal during the term for inefficiency neglect of duty or malfeasance in office40 the judges salaries are set at the same rate as judges of the district courts of the united states41 currently 16930000 per annum42 representation of partiesedit the chief counsel of the internal revenue service irs or his delegate represents the executive branch in the tax court43 the tax court permits persons who are not attorneys at law to be admitted to practice to represent taxpayers by applying for admission and passing an examination administered by the court attorneys who provide evidence of membership and good standing in state bar or the dc bar can be admitted to the bar of the court without sitting for the tax court examination tax court practice is highly specialized and most practitioners are licensed attorneys who specialize in tax controversiescitation needed genesis of a tax court disputeedit many tax court cases involve disputes over federal income tax and penalties often after an examination by the internal revenue service of a taxpayers return after issuance of a series of preliminary written notices and a lack of agreement between the taxpayer and the irs the irs formally determines the amount of the deficiency and issues a formal notice called a statutory notice of deficiency or ninety day letter44 in this context the term deficiency is a legal term of art and is not necessarily equal to the amount of unpaid tax although it usually is the deficiency is generally the excess of the amount the irs contends is the correct tax over the amount the taxpayer showed on the return—in both cases without regard to how much has actually been paid45 upon issuance of the statutory notice of deficiency after irs determination of the tax amount but before the formal irs assessment of the tax the taxpayer generally has 90 days to file a tax court petition for redetermination of the deficiency46 if no petition is timely filed the irs may then statutorily assess the tax to assess the tax in this sense means to administratively and formally record the tax on the books of the united states department of the treasury47 this formal statutory assessment is a critical act as the statutory tax lien that later arises is effective retroactively to the date of the assessment and encumbers all property and rights to property of the taxpayer48 life cycle of a tax court caseedit the united states tax court building in washington dc because of the negative legal consequences ensuing with respect to a statutory assessment especially the tax lien and the flora requirement that the taxpayer otherwise pay the full disputed amount and sue for refund a taxpayer is often well advised to file a tax court petition in a timely manner the rule in the tax court is that the taxpayer sues the commissioner of internal revenue with the taxpayer as petitioner and the commissioner as respondent this rule is an example of an exception to the general rule that the proper party defendant in a us tax case filed by a taxpayer against the government is united states of america in the tax court the commissioner is not named personally the secretary of the treasury the department of the treasury and the internal revenue service are not proper parties the petition must be timely filed within the allowable time the court cannot extend the time for filing which is set by statute a 60 filing fee must be paid when the petition is filed once the petition is filed payment of the underlying tax ordinarily is postponed until the case has been decided in certain tax disputes involving 50000 or less taxpayers may elect to have the case conducted under the courts simplified small tax case procedure49 trials in small tax cases generally are less formal and result in a speedier disposition however decisions entered pursuant to small tax case procedures are not appealable and are not precedential cases are calendared for trial as soon as practicable on a first infirst out basis after the case becomes at issue when a case is calendared the parties are notified by the court of the date time and place of trial trials are conducted before one judge without a jury and taxpayers are permitted to represent themselves if they desire however the vast majority of cases are settled by mutual agreement without the necessity of a trial however if a trial is conducted in due course a report is ordinarily issued by the presiding judge setting forth findings of fact and an opinion the case is then closed in accordance with the judges opinion by entry of a decision appellate reviewedit either the petitioner the taxpayer or the respondent the commissioner of internal revenue may take an appeal from an adverse decision of the tax court to the appropriate united states court of appeals in the case of an appeal by the taxpayer a bond is normally required in order to avoid enforcement action during the pendency of the appeal50 instead of taking an appeal the internal revenue service may issue an action on decision indicating the commissioners nonacquiescence in the decision meaning that the commissioner will not follow the decision in subsequent cases51 in such cases the commissioner hopes for the opportunity to litigate the matter in another circuit where he will have a better chance of obtaining reversal on appealcitation needed notesedit us const art i sec 8 cl 9 see 26
