since the 2005 season short punts by drew butler on arizonas first two drives gave the panthers excellent field position from the cardinals 48yard line and their own 43yard line on their first two possessions which they converted into ten points a 48yard graham gano field goal and a 13yard touchdown run by jonathan stewart the cardinals had to punt again on their next drive but panthers receiver brenton bersin muffed the kick and justin bethel recovered the ball for arizona on the carolina 30yard line a 15yard roughing the passer penalty on defensive tackle charles johnson and a 14yard reception by larry fitzgerald moved the ball to the 1yard line where ryan lindley finished the drive with a touchdown pass to tight end darren fells on the first play of the second quarter cutting the score to 10–7 carolina responded by moving the ball to the cardinals 25yard line but came up empty when gano missed a 43yard field goal attempt later in the quarter arizona defensive back antonio cromartie intercepted a pass from cam newton and returned it 50 yards to the panthers 17yard line three plays later the cardinals took their first lead of the game 14–10 on a 1yard touchdown run by rookie running back marion grice grice lost the ball as he went into the end zone and the play was initially ruled a fumble recovered by the panthers but after a replay review the call was reversed on grounds that grice crossed the goal line before the ball came out of his hands the panthers struck back with a 59yard drive including newtons 23yard completion to receiver corey brown to score on ganos 39yard field goal making the score 14–13 at the end of the half in the second half the panthers completely took over the game holding arizona to just 12 yards from scrimmage early in the third quarter butlers 31yard punt gave carolina the ball on the cardinals 39yard line on the next play running back fozzy whittaker caught a screen pass from newton and raced all the way to end zone to retake the lead for his team at 20–14 then melvin white forced a fumble from cardinals kick returner ted ginn jr which kevin reddick recovered for carolina on the arizona 3yard line two plays later newtons 1yard touchdown pass to fullback mike tolbert increased their lead to 27–14 at this point 404 remained in the third quarter but the panthers defense would shut out arizonas offense for the rest of the game in the fourth quarter the cardinals had a chance to get back in the game when linebacker sam acho forced a fumble while sacking newton which safety rashad johnson picked up and returned 30 yards to the panthers 8yard line but on the next play lindley was intercepted by linebacker luke kuechly later on they got another scoring chance when panthers punter brad nortman fumbled a snap and was forced out of bounds at the panthers 47yard line but once again the cardinals lost a turnover this time an interception by safety tre boston arizona would not score again until nortman deliberately downed the ball in the end zone for a safety with three seconds left on the clock making the final score 27–16 lindley filling in for injured starter carson palmer and injured backup drew stanton completed 16 out of 28 passes but for just 82 yards and two interceptions newton threw for 198 yards with two touchdowns and an interception while also rushing for 35 yards stewart was the top

down as the pass fell incomplete8910 back judge lee dyer threw a flag for defensive pass interference after referee pete morelli announced the penalty head linesman jerry bergman determined that hitchens actions did not warrant a penalty11 morelli then announced there was no foul on the play and the flag was picked up1213 the decision to change the initial call received significant media attention after the game and was widely decried as incorrect8111415 nfl vice president of officiating dean blandino stated that the nocall on pass interference was debatable but holding definitely should have been called on the play16 the reversed call turned out to be crucial detroit tried to force the cowboys to go offside on fourth and 1 but failed to do so and were penalized five yards for

in the hands of quarterback tom brady who proved up to the task completing 33 of 50 passes for 367 yards and three touchdowns while also rushing for a score as he led the team back from two 14point deficits to earn their fourth consecutive afc championship game and their ninth in his 14 years as the teams starter baltimore stormed to an early lead on their first drive as joe flacco connected with steve smith sr for 19 yards and torrey smith for 22 before getting the ball into the end zone with a 19yard completion to kamar aiken following a new england punt ravens running back justin forsett rushed four times for 32 yards while flacco completed five of six passes for 40 yards the last one a 9yard touchdown pass to smith sr to give baltimore a 14–0 lead with 444 left in the first quarter however this time new england managed to respond faced with third and 8 from his own 24yard line brady completed a 16yard pass to tight end rob gronkowski on the next play he completed a 46yard pass to gronkowski on the ravens 14yard line and eventually he finished the 8play 78yard drive with a 4yard touchdown run after the next three drives ended in punts new england drove 67 yards including a 23yard reception by gronkowski on third and 8 to tie the score at 14–14 with bradys 15yard touchdown pass to danny amendola with 337 left in the second quarter but just before halftime ravens linebacker daryl smith intercepted a pass from brady at the baltimore 43yard line aided by a 20yard pass interference penalty the ravens drove 57 yards in six plays and took a 21–14 lead on flaccos 11yard touchdown pass to tight end owen daniels in the back of the end zone with 10 seconds left in the half baltimore retook their 14point lead with the first drive of the second half after flaccos 35yard completion to smith on the patriots 1yard line a taunting penalty against smith moved the ball back to the 16yard line but the ravens still scored on the next play with flaccos 16yard completion to forsett to make the score 28–14 new england responded by making some key adjustments to their formation for their ensuing drive having already lost starting center bryan stork for the game with an injury the patriots went with four linemen while playing tight end michael hoomanawanui and running back shane vereen on the line next to them this confused the baltimore defense as to which players were eligible receivers — though they did announce it to officials as required — aiding the patriots on a 9play 80yard touchdown drive in which the team never faced a third down this infuriated ravens coach john harbaugh enough that he stormed onto the field to argue with officials earning his team a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct shortly after brady threw a 5yard touchdown pass to gronkowski cutting the score to 28–21 after a baltimore punt brady tossed a lateral pass across the field to receiver julian edelman who promptly threw a 51yard touchdown pass to a wideopen amendola tying the game at 28 with under four minutes left in the third quarter then patriots safety devin mccourty gave his team a great chance to take the lead by intercepting a pass from flacco on the ravens 37yard line it was flaccos first postseason interception in his last 197 postseason pass attempts ending the second longest streak of passes without an interception by a quarterback in postseason history however new england was unable to move the ball and punted rather than try a long field goal attempt early in the fourth quarter ravens kicker justin tucker finished a 16play 73yard drive which included flaccos 11yard completion to fullback kyle juszczyk on fourth and 1 from the patriots 36yard line with a 25yard field goal giving his team the lead at 31–28 taking the ball back at their own 26yard line new england drove 74 yards in 10 plays for what turned out to be the game winning score on the third play of the drive baltimore recovered a fumble from vereen only to see it overturned by replay review later brady converted the only third down on the drive hitting amendola with a 6yard pass on third and 6 finally with 513 left on the clock he threw a 23yard touchdown pass to receiver brandon lafell giving new england their first and only lead of the game 35–31 baltimore responded with a drive to the new england 36yard line but with 137 left in the game safety duron harmon intercepted flaccos pass in the end zone after the ravens managed to force a punt with a few seconds left on the clock flacco threw a final hail mary pass to the end zone that was knocked down for an incompletion after the game harbaugh complained about new englands unusual formation use on their third quarter touchdown drive its not something that anybody has ever done before harbaugh said theyre an illegal type of a thing and im sure that the league will make some adjustments and things like that we wanted an opportunity to be able to identify who the eligible players were because what they were doing was they would announce the eligible player and tom would take it to the line right away and snap the ball before we even figured out who was lined up where and that was the deception part of it it was clearly deception maybe those guys gotta study the rule book and figure it out brady countered in response we obviously knew what we were doing and we made some pretty important plays it was a real good weapon for us maybe well have something in store next week18 the nfl sided with new england finding that their methods were legal19 in the ensuing offseason in response to these tactics taken by the patriots the league passed a new rule requiring all ineligible receivers including any offensive player with an eligible number that declares himself ineligible to line up inside the tackle box prior to the snap2021 flacco finished the game 28for45 for 292 yards and a postseason career high four touchdowns with two interceptions – his first multi interception postseason game in his last nine postseason games flaccos postseason record also fell to 1–5 when he throws at least one interception while it remained a perfect 9–0 when he does not throw an interception forsett rushed for 129 yards while also catching two passes for 17 yards and a score gronkowski was the top receiver of the game with seven receptions for 108 yards and a touchdown brady and patriots coach bill belichick set numerous nfl and franchise playoff records in the game brady became the nfls career postseason leader in passing yards and touchdown passes 46 surpassing joe montana on his final touchdown pass of the game he set a franchise record for completions in a postseason game 33 while also tying a franchise playoff record for career rushing touchdowns 5 this was belichicks 20th postseason win tying the alltime record held by tom landry this was also the first time in playoff history that a team had come back from two 14point deficits to win a game22 nfc seattle seahawks 31

end zone however seattle fared no better as wilson was intercepted a few plays later by safety ha ha clintondix who returned the ball 26 yards to the seahawks 4yard line before a penalty pushed the team back to the 19yard line green bay managed to reach the seattle 1yard line but they failed to break the goal line with consecutive running plays forcing them to settle for mason crosbys 19yard field goal then packers linebacker brad jones forced a fumble from kick returner doug baldwin which safety morgan burnett recovered on the seahawks 23yard line the packers again drove to the 1yard line but had to settle for another crosby field goal to go up 6–0 following a seahawks punt green bay increased their lead to 13–0 with a 7play 56yard drive that ended on rodgers 13yard touchdown pass to randall cobb on the last play of the first quarter early in the second quarter packers defensive back micah hyde returned a punt 29 yards to the seattle 33yard line setting up crosbys third field goal that increased green bays lead to 16–0 the only score of the quarter on the first play after the ensuing kickoff clintondix intercepted another pass from wilson giving green bay a first down on their 44yard line but a few plays later rodgers returned the favor by throwing a pass that was intercepted by defensive back byron maxwell seattle then drove to the packers 18yard line only to have wilson throw an interception to sam shields in the end zone after an exchange of punts started the second half seattle finally got on the board with an 11play 78yard drive featuring a 29yard completion from wilson to baldwin faced with fourth and 10 on the packers 19yard line the seahawks made one of the most critical plays of the game coach pete carroll sent the field goal unit onto the field but ran a fake field goal play with punter jon ryan previously utilized as the holder taking the snap and running to the left as he headed for the line of scrimmage he managed to pull the entire green bay defense toward him leaving rookie offensive tackle garry gilliam who had checked in as an eligible receiver wide open down the field ryan threw a pass just before reaching the line which gilliam hauled in for a touchdown cutting the seahawks deficit to 16–7 early in the fourth quarter a 32yard burst by packers running back james starks sparked a 57yard drive that ended with crosbys 48yard field goal putting green bay up 19–7 green bay seemed in control of the game now especially when wilson threw his fourth interception of the day this one to burnett giving the packers the ball at their 43yard line with just over five minutes left in regulation however seattles defense made a crucial stand three carries by eddie lacy resulted in a tackle by kevin williams for a 4yard loss a tackle by michael bennett for a 2yard loss and a 2yard gain green bay had forced seattle to use two timeouts but they punted the ball back after running just 112 off the clock taking the ball back on their 31yard line with 352 left seattle running back marshawn lynch started the drive with a 14yard run then wilson hooked up with baldwin for a 20yard completion and later connected with lynch for a 26yard gain two plays later wilson scored on a 1yard touchdown run trimming green bays lead to 19–1431 with 209 and one timeout remaining seattle decided to attempt an onside kick steven hauschkas kick went up in the air and straight to packers tight end brandon bostick however bostick was unable to make the catch and the ball bounced off his helmet going right into the arms of seattle receiver chris matthews to give the seahawks a first down at midfield from there it took just four plays to score on lynchs 24yard touchdown run with 125 remaining on the clock on the subsequent 2point conversion play wilson was flushed out of the pocket forced to run backwards and to the right sideline just before being hit he launched a high floating pass from the 17yard line to the opposite side of the field tight end luke willson who had not been assigned to do anything except block on the play caught wilsons pass at the 1yard line and took the ball into the end zone to give the seahawks a 22–19 lead after the kickoff rodgers completed a pair of 15yard passes to cobb and jordy nelson then he scrambled 12 yards to the seahawks 36yard line following two incompletions and a 6yard toss to nelson crosby kicked his fifth field goal of the day tying the score at 22–22 with 14 seconds left on the clock and sending the game into overtime32 seattle won the coin toss and started overtime backed up on their own 13yard line after driving to the 30yard line they found themselves facing third and 6 wilson took the snap and fired a pass to baldwin who broke ahead of defensive back casey hayward on a streak pattern down the right sideline and hauled in the catch for a 35yard gain to the packers 35yard line on the next play wilson launched a nearly identical pass to kearse who was running straight down the middle of the field kearse was tightly covered by tramon williams but managed to pull ahead of him just enough to make the catch for a 35yard touchdown reception sending seattle to their third super bowl in franchise history33 this was kearses only catch of the game prior to this he had been targeted five times by wilson four of those five attempts had been intercepted34 wilson finished the game 14for29 for 209 yards and a touchdown with four interceptions while also rushing for 25 yards and a touchdown baldwin was the top receiver of the game with six receptions for 106 yards while also returning three kickoffs for 58 yards lynch had 25 carries for 157 yards and a touchdown while also catching a 26yard pass rodgers was 19for34 for 178 yards and a touchdown with two interceptions lacy was the teams top rusher with 73 yards while nelson was their top receiver with five receptions for 71 yards burnett had 10 tackles – eight of which were solo
