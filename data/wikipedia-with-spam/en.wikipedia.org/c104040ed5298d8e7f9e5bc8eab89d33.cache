policies that banned network use for commercial activities by forprofit institutions56 the nsfnet began phasing out its commercial use ban in 199178910 emailedit the first widely publicized example of online advertising was conducted via electronic mail on 3 may 1978 a marketer from dec digital equipment corporation gary thuerk sent an email to most of the arpanets american west coast users advertising an open house for a new model of a dec computer611 despite the prevailing acceptable use policies electronic mail marketing rapidly expanded12 and eventually became known as spam the first known largescale noncommercial spam message was sent on 18 january 1994 by an andrews university system administrator by crossposting a religious message to all usenet newsgroups13 in january 1994 mark eberra started the first email marketing company for opt in email list under the domain insideconnectcom he also started the direct email marketing association to help stop unwanted email and prevent spam 14 15 four months later laurence canter and martha siegel partners in a law firm broadly promoted their legal services in a usenet posting titled green card lottery – final one16 canter and siegels green card usenet spam raised the profile of online advertising stimulating widespread interest in advertising via both usenet and traditional email13 more recently spam has evolved into a more industrial operation where spammers use armies of virusinfected computers botnets to send spam remotely11 display adsedit online banner advertising began in the early 1990s as page owners sought additional revenue streams to support their content commercial online service prodigy displayed banners at the bottom of the screen to promote sears products17 the first clickable web ad was sold by

recent trendsedit more recently companies have sought to merge their advertising messages into editorial content or valuable services examples include red bulls red bull media house streaming felix baumgartners jump from space online cocacolas online magazines and nikes free applications for performance tracking20 advertisers are also embracing social media2425 and mobile advertising mobile ad spending has grown 90 each year from 2010 to 2013113 delivery methodsedit display advertisingedit example of display advertising featuring geotargeting display advertising conveys its advertising message visually using text logos animations videos photographs or other graphics display advertisers frequently target users with particular traits to increase the ads effect online advertisers typically through their ad servers often use cookies which are unique identifiers of specific computers to decide which ads to serve to a particular consumer cookies can track whether a user left a page without buying anything so the advertiser can later retarget the user with ads from the site the user visited26 as advertisers collect data across multiple external websites about a users online activity they can create a detailed profile of the users interests to deliver even more targeted advertising this aggregation of data is called behavioral targeting27 advertisers can also target their audience by using contextual to deliver display ads related to the content of the web page where the ads appear21118 retargeting behavioral targeting and contextual advertising all are designed to increase an advertisers return on investment or roi over untargeted ads28 advertisers may also deliver ads based on a users suspected geography through geotargeting a users ip address communicates some geographic information at minimum the users country or general region the geographic information from an ip can be supplemented and refined with other proxies or information to narrow the range of possible locations29 for example with mobile devices advertisers can sometimes use a phones gps receiver or the location of nearby mobile towers30 cookies and other persistent data on a users machine may provide help narrowing a users location further29 web banner advertisingedit web banners or banner ads typically are graphical ads displayed within a web page many banner ads are delivered by a central ad server banner ads can use rich media to incorporate video audio animations buttons forms or other interactive elements using java applets html5 adobe flash and other programs frame ad traditional banneredit frame ads were the first form of web banners19 the colloquial usage of banner ads often refers to traditional frame ads website publishers incorporate frame ads by setting aside a particular space on the web page the interactive advertising bureaus ad unit guidelines proposes standardized pixel dimensions for ad units31 popupspopundersedit a popup ad is displayed in a new web browser window that opens above a website visitors initial browser window32 a popunder ad opens a new browser window under a website visitors initial browser window122 popunder ads and similar technologies are now advised against by online authorities such as google who state that they do not condone this practice33 floating adedit a floating ad or overlay ad is a type of rich media advertisement that appears superimposed over the requested websites content floating ads may disappear or become less obtrusive after a preset time period expanding adedit an expanding ad is a rich media frame ad that changes dimensions upon a predefined condition such as a preset amount of time a visitor spends on a webpage the users click on the ad or the users mouse movement over the ad34 expanding ads allow advertisers to fit more information into a restricted ad space trick bannersedit a trick banner is a banner ad where the ad copy imitates some screen element users commonly encounter such as an operating system message or popular application message to induce ad clicks35 trick banners typically do not mention the advertiser in the initial ad and thus they are a form of baitandswitch3637 trick banners commonly attract a higherthanaverage clickthrough rate but tricked users may resent the advertiser for deceiving them38 news feed adsedit news feed ads also called sponsored stories boosted posts typically exist on social media platforms that offer a steady stream of information updates news feed39 in regulated formats ie in similar sized small boxes with a uniform style those advertisements are intertwined with nonpromoted news that the users are reading through those advertisements can be of any content such as promoting a website a fan page an app or a product some examples are facebooks sponsored stories40 linkedins sponsored updates41 and twitters promoted tweets42 this display ads format falls into its own category because unlike banner ads which are quite distinguishable news feed ads format blends well into nonpaid news updates this format of online advertisement yields much higher clickthrough rates than traditional display ads4344 display advertising process overviewedit the process by which online advertising is displayed can involve many parties in the simplest case the web site publisher selects and serves the ads publishers which operate their own advertising departments may use this method online advertising serving process simple publisher case the ads may be outsourced to an advertising agency under contract with the publisher and served from the advertising agencys servers online advertising serving process using an ad agency online advertising serving process using online bidding alternatively ad space may be offered for sale in a bidding market using an ad exchange and realtime bidding this involves many parties interacting automatically in real time in response to a request from the users browser the publisher content server sends the web page content to the users browser over the internet the page does not yet contain ads but contains links which cause the users browser to connect to the publisher ad server to request that the spaces left for ads be filled in with ads information identifying the user such as cookies and the page being viewed is transmitted to the publisher ad server the publisher ad server then communicates with a supplyside platform server the publisher is offering ad space for sale so they are considered the supplier the supply side platform also receives the users identifying information which it sends to a data management platform at the data management platform the users identifying information is used to look up demographic information previous purchases and other information of interest to advertisers broadly speaking there are three types of data obtained through such a data management platform first party data refers to the data retrieved from customer relationship management crm platforms in addition to website and paid media content or crossplatform data this can include data from customer behaviors actions or interests45 second party data refers to an amalgamation of statistics related to cookie pools on external publications and platforms the data is provided directly from the source adservers hosted solutions for social or an analytics platform it is also possible to negotiate a deal with a particular publisher to secure specific data points or audiences46 third party data is sourced from external providers and often aggregated from numerous websites businesses sell thirdparty data and are able to share this via an array of distribution avenues47 this customer information is combined and returned to the supply side platform which can now package up the offer of ad space along with information about the user who will view it the supply side platform sends that offer to an ad exchange the ad exchange puts the offer out for bid to demandside platforms demand side platforms act on behalf of ad agencies who sell ads which advertise brands demand side platforms thus have ads ready to display and are searching for users to view them bidders get the information about the user ready to view the ad and decide based on that information how much to offer to buy the ad space according to the internet advertising bureau a demand side platform has 10 milliseconds to respond to an offer the ad exchange picks the winning bid and informs both parties the ad exchange then passes the link to the ad back through the supply side platform and the publishers ad server to the users browser which then requests the ad content from the agencys ad server the ad agency can thus confirm that the ad was delivered to the browser48 this is simplified according to the iab exchanges may try to unload unsold remnant space at low prices through other exchanges some agencies maintain semipermanent precached bids with ad exchanges and those may be examined before going out to additional demand side platforms for bids the process for mobile advertising is different and may involve mobile carriers and handset software manufacturers48 interstitialedit an interstitial ad displays before a user can access requested content sometimes while the user is waiting for the content to load49 interstitial ads are a form of interruption marketing5051 text adsedit a text ad displays textbased hyperlinks textbased ads may display separately from a web pages primary content or they can be embedded by hyperlinking individual

message to potential customers mille is the latin word for thousand in the online context ad displays are usually called impressions definitions of an impression vary among publishers61 and some impressions may not be charged because they dont represent a new exposure to an actual customer62 advertisers can use technologies such as web bugs to verify if an impression is actually delivered636459 publishers use a variety of techniques to increase page views such as dividing content across multiple pages repurposing someone elses content using sensational titles or publishing

such as completing a purchase or filling out a registration form performancebased compensation can also incorporate revenue sharing where publishers earn a percentage of the advertisers profits made

advertising endangers the security and privacy of users81 banner blindnessedit eyetracking studies have shown that internet users often ignore web page zones likely to contain display ads sometimes called banner blindness and this problem is worse online than in offline media82 on the other hand studies suggest that even those ads ignored by the users may influence the user subconsciously83 fraud on the advertiseredit there are numerous ways that advertisers can be overcharged for their advertising for example click fraud occurs when a publisher or third parties click manually or through automated means on a cpc ad with no legitimate buying intent84 for example click fraud can occur when a competitor clicks on ads to deplete its rivals advertising budget or when publishers attempt to manufacture revenue84 click fraud is especially associated with pornography sites in 2011 certain scamming porn websites launched dozens of hidden pages on each visitors computer forcing the visitors computer to click on hundreds of paid links without the visitors knowledge85 as with offline publications online impression fraud can occur when publishers overstate the number of ad impressions they have delivered to their advertisers to combat impression fraud several publishing and advertising industry associations are developing ways to count online impressions credibly8687 technological variationsedit heterogeneous clientsedit because users have different operating systems web browsers88 and computer hardware including mobile devices and different screen sizes online ads may appear to users differently from how the advertiser intended or the ads may not display properly at all a 2012 comscore study revealed that on average 31 of ads were not inview when rendered meaning they never had an opportunity to be seen89 rich media ads create even greater compatibility problems as some developers may use competing and exclusive software to render the ads see eg comparison of html 5 and flash90 furthermore advertisers may encounter legal problems if legally required information doesnt actually display to users even if that failure is due to technological heterogeneity91i in the united states the ftc has released a set of guidelines indicating that its the advertisers responsibility to ensure the ads display any required disclosures or disclaimers irrespective of the users technology914–8 ad blockingedit ad blocking or ad filtering means the ads do not appear to the user because the user uses technology to screen out ads many browsers block unsolicited popup ads by default92 other software programs or browser addons may also block the loading of ads or block elements on a page with behaviors characteristic of ads eg html autoplay of both audio and video approximately 9 of all online page views come from browsers with adblocking software installed93 and some publishers have 40 of their visitors using adblockers4 antitargeting technologiesedit some web browsers offer privacy modes where users can hide information about themselves from publishers and advertisers among other consequences advertisers cant use cookies to serve targeted ads to private browsers most major browsers have incorporated do not track options into their browser headers but the regulations currently are only enforced by the honor system949596 privacy concernsedit the collection of user information by publishers and advertisers has raised consumer concerns about their privacy2964 sixty percent of internet users would use do not track technology to block all collection of information if given an opportunity9798 over half of all google and facebook users are concerned about their privacy when using google and facebook according to gallup99 many consumers have reservations about online behavioral targeting by tracking users online activities advertisers are able to understand consumers quite well advertisers often use technology such as web bugs and respawning cookies to maximizing their abilities to track consumers6460100101 according to a 2011 survey conducted by harris interactive over half of internet users had a negative impression of online behavioral advertising and forty percent feared that their personallyidentifiable information had been shared with advertisers without their consent102103 consumers can be especially troubled by advertisers targeting them based on sensitive information such as financial or health status100 furthermore some advertisers attach the mac address of users devices to their demographic profiles so they can be retargeted regardless of the accuracy of the profile even if the user clears their cookies and browsing historycitation needed trustworthiness of advertisersedit scammers can take advantage of consumers difficulties verifying an online personas identity1041 leading to artifices like phishing where scam emails look identical to those from a wellknown brand owner105 and confidence schemes like the nigerian 419 scam106107108 the internet crime complaint center received 289874 complaints in 2012 totaling over half a billion dollars in losses most of which originated with scam ads109110 consumers also face malware risks ie malvertising when interacting with online advertising ciscos 2013 annual security report revealed that clicking on ads was 182 times more likely to install a virus on a users computer than surfing the internet for porn111112 for example in august 2014 yahoos advertising network reportedly saw cases of infection of a variant of cryptolocker ransomware113 spamedit the internets low cost of disseminating advertising contributes to spam especially by largescale spammers numerous efforts have been undertaken to combat spam ranging from blacklists to regulatorilyrequired labeling to content filters but most of those efforts have adverse collateral effects such as mistaken filtering6 regulationedit in general consumer protection laws apply equally to online and offline activities91i however there are questions over which jurisdictions laws apply and which regulatory agencies have enforcement authority over transborder activity114 as with offline advertising industry participants have undertaken numerous efforts to selfregulate and develop industry standards or codes of conduct several united states advertising industry organizations jointly published selfregulatory principles for online behavioral advertising based on standards proposed by the ftc in 2009115 european ad associations published a similar document in 2011116 primary tenets of both documents include consumer control of data transfer to third parties data security and consent for collection of certain health and financial data1152–4 neither framework however penalizes violators of the codes of conduct117 privacy and data collectionedit privacy regulation can require users consent before an advertiser can track the user or communicate with the user however affirmative consent opt in can be difficult and expensive to obtain6460 industry participants often prefer other regulatory schemes different jurisdictions have taken different approaches to privacy issues with advertising the united states has specific restrictions on online tracking of children in the childrens online privacy protection act coppa11516–17 and the ftc has recently expanded its interpretation of coppa to include requiring ad networks to obtain parental consent before knowingly tracking kids118 otherwise the us federal trade commission frequently supports industry selfregulation although increasingly it has been undertaking enforcement actions related to online privacy and security119 the ftc has also been pushing for industry consensus about possible do not track legislation in contrast the european unions privacy and electronic communications directive restricts websites ability to use consumer data much more comprehensively the eu limitations restrict targeting by online advertisers researchers have estimated online advertising effectiveness decreases on average by around 65 in europe relative to the rest of the world6458 delivery methodsedit many laws specifically regulate the ways online ads are delivered for example online advertising delivered via email is more regulated than the same ad content delivered via banner ads among other restrictions the us canspam act of 2003 requires that any commercial email provide an optout mechanism114 similarly mobile advertising is governed by the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 tcpa which among other restrictions requires user optin before sending advertising via text messaging see alsoedit adblock advertising advertising campaign advertising
