the webby awards and the lovie awards the leading honors for websites and individual achievement in technology and creativity presented by the academy the webbys and the lovies recognize excellence in interactive creativity establishing best practices on a yearly basis and thus pushing the standards of web development continually higher 1 according to the iadas website their purpose is to recognize and acknowledge excellence in interactive content across emerging technologies 1 to connect a diverse group of luminaries to facilitate growth and development in the digital arts and sciences 1 to educate industry professionals and the publicatlarge about what is relevant making technology accessible and integrating it into the general culture1 in 2011 iadas pinpointed five challenges the internet faces in the next five years in response to the exponential growth of the internet and its users as the internet grows more complex the ways in which it functions grows less transparent and as the internet enters its fourth decade the iadas believes the next five years must see improvements in privacy protection copyright law net neutrality the open web and internet security 2 privacy protectionedit more private information is shared and stored on the internet than ever before platforms such as facebook and keepass are virtual repositories for everything from the most mundane to most significant aspects of a consumers life the iadas is concerned that hackers may harvest personal data to sell or steal in identity theft scams as more people use their cellphones for social media and clouds to store personal information2 the iadas believes that global standards concerning privacy protection must be implemented and greater importance placed on educating consumers about privacy practices privacy policies also need greater transparency while social media moguls like facebook should be held accountable to the public2 copyright lawsedit copyright laws are currently outofdate and falling behind the technology curve downloading and sharing audio visual ebooks and online articles has become instant and easier than ever but the laws governing what constitutes copyright infringement are murky in regards to online data copyright laws must be modernized to reflect the complicated relationship between the creative and technological2 net neutralityedit search filtering is rampant with certain companies enjoying more ubiquity on the internet than others the iadas believes that users should be in total control of choosing what the best content and the best services are offered on the internet in this way web traffic will flow freely and equally2 the open webedit the interconnectivity of the web is being threatened by new social media platforms and personalized mobile devices that takes users off the internet and focused on their smartphones and tablets the iadas fears that this will lead to a fragmented web that lacks cohesion the web must be an open inclusive community rather than a series of gated ones where it is difficult to cross borders from one application or platform to the next2 internet securityedit digital data is constantly at risk especially for people that do not realize the ease with which private information may be stolen or corrupted on the internet people store personal information on social media sites bank online handle mortgages pay bills any number of private business can be handled via the internet consumers must recognize and take responsibility for the information they allow on the web while the industry must take greater pains to ensure internet security the government educational institutions and private citizens must collaborate to reevaluate how they share store and publish sensitive information on the internet 2 webby awardsedit main article webby award this section is empty you can help by adding to it march 2013 lovie awardsedit the lovie awards is the european counterpart to the webbys which
