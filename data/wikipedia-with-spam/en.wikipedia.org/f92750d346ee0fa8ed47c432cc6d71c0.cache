late2000s when its founder and president james irwin died in 20097 in late 2013 the trust fund became exhausted and there was no money left to run the award7 the council agreed to step in and continue funding the award under the same brand name of the nowdefunct company while seeking a new sponsor7 it was reported that the council paid €100000 for the prize plus €80250 in administration costs in 20157 the award was subsequently renamed the international dublin literary award in november 2015 describing the award as the most eclectic and unpredictable of the literary worlds annual gongs the
