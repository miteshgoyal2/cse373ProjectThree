honorific nicknames in popular music from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search king of rock and roll redirects here for other uses see king of rock and roll disambiguation honorific nicknames in popular music are terms used most often in the media or by fans to indicate the significance of an artist and are often religious familial or most frequently royal and aristocratic titles used metaphorically honorific nicknames were used in classical music in europe as early as the early nineteenth century with figures such as mozart being called the father of modern music and bach the father of modern piano music1 they were also particularly prominent in africanamerican culture in the postcivil war era perhaps as a means of conferring status that had been negated by slavery2 and as a result entered early jazz and blues music including figures such as duke ellington and count basie3 in american culture despite its republican constitution and ideology4 honorific nicknames have been used to describe leading figures in various areas of activity such as industry commerce sport and the media father or mother have been used for innovators and royal titles such as king and queen for dominant figures in a field56 in the 1930s and 1940s as jazz and swing music were gaining popularity it was the more commercially successful white artists paul whiteman and benny goodman who became known as the king of jazz and the king of swing respectively despite such genres of music originating from africanamerican culture7 these patterns of naming were transferred to rock and roll when it emerged in the 1950s there was a series of attempts to find and a number of claimants to be the king of rock n roll a title that became most associated with elvis presley8 this has been seen as part of a process of the appropriation of credit for innovation of the then new music by a white establishment9 different honorifics have been taken or given for other leading figures in the genre such as the architect of rock and roll by little richard from the 1990s10 but this term like many is also used for other important figures in this case including pioneer electric guitarist les paul11 similar honorific nicknames have been given in other genres including aretha franklin who was literally crowned queen of soul by disk jockey pervis spann on stage in 196812 madonna and michael jackson have been closely associated with the terms queen and king of pop since the 1980s13 some nicknames have been strongly promulgated and contested by various artists14 and occasionally disowned or played down by their subjects15 some notable honorific nicknames are in general usage and commonly identified with particular individuals contents 1 individual titles 11 a
