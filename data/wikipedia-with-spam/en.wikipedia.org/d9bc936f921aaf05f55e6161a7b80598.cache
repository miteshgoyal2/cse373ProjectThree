googles ideological echo chamber from wikipedia the free encyclopedia   redirected from google memo jump to navigation search googles ideological echo chamber also known as the google memo originated as an internal memo dated july 2017 by usbased google engineer james damore about googles diversity policies damore argued that google had shut down the conversation about diversity1 and that google has engaged in legally doubtful discriminative policies to increase diversity damore also posited that while discrimination exists the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we dont see equal representation of women in tech and leadership and suggested alternative methods to increase diversity2 google ceo sundar pichai responded by saying that parts of the memo advanced harmful gender stereotypes and fired damore for allegedly violating the companys code of conduct3 the memo and googles subsequent dismissal of damore were widely discussed in the media contents 1 course of events 2 responses 21 on the science 22 impact on google 23 concerns about sexism 24 employment law and free speech concerns 25 cultural commentary 26 other commentary 3 see also 4 references 5 further reading 6 external links course of eventsedit james damore became motivated to write a memo after attending an unrecorded google diversity program whose rhetoric he described as largely shaming and no you cant say that thats sexist4 he characterized this as an almost cultlike work environment in which dissenting opinions could not be voiced5 after trying to discuss the issue with peers and being mostly ignored damore wrote the memo while on a flight to china67 the memo proposed that googles approach to diversity was formed by political bias to the point where their policies could not be questioned calling the culture an ideological echo chamber the memo asserted that discrimination exists but it is extreme to hold that all disparities are due to oppression and that it was authoritarian to correct for this with reverse discrimination instead it argued that the gender disparity could be partially explained by biological differences between women and men89 according to damore those differences include women generally having a stronger interest in people rather than things that women tend to be more social more artistic and more prone to neuroticism higher anxiety lower stress tolerance10 the memorandum also listed multiple suggestions on ways to use those differences in order to increase womens representation in tech without resorting to discrimination98 the memo was dated july 2017 and originally shared on an internal mailing list1112 it was later updated to begin with a paragraph affirming the authors opposition to workplace sexism and the use of stereotypes13 on august 5 the memo was published by gizmodo initially with charts and hyperlinks removed from the citations backing up its argumentation14 the memos publication resulted in a controversy across social media and public criticism of the memo and its author from several google employees151617 according to wired googles internal forums showed plenty of support for damore who said he received private thanks from employees who were afraid to come forward181920 damore was fired by google on august 7 201721 the same day prior to being fired damore filed a complaint with the national labor relations board222324 case no 32ca20389125 the complaint is marked as 8a1 coercive statements threats promises of benefits etc26clarification needed a subsequent statement from google asserted that its executives were unaware of the complaint when they fired damore as it is illegal to fire an employee in retaliation of a nlrb complaint6 following his firing damore announced he would pursue legal action against google27 googles vp of diversity danielle brown responded to the memo on august 8 part of building an open inclusive environment means fostering a culture in which those with alternative views including different political views feel safe sharing their opinions but that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our code of conduct policies and antidiscrimination laws16 googles ceo sundar pichai wrote a note to google employees supporting browns formal response and adding that many of the contents of the documents were fair to debate his explanation read to suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not ok  at the same time there are coworkers who are questioning whether they can safely express their views in the workplace especially those with a minority viewpoint they too feel under threat and that is also not ok28 unauthorized ads criticizing pichai and google for the firing were put up shortly after29 damore characterized the response by google executives as having shamed him for his views30 nbc described the fallout as perhaps the biggest setback to what has been a foundational premise for google employees the freedom to speak up about anything and everything31 gab a social networking site selfdescribed as a profreespeech platform offered damore a job immediately and julian assange offered him a job with wikileaks1232 damore soon gave interviews to bloomberg technology and to the youtube channels of canadian professor jordan peterson and podcaster stefan molyneux33343536 damore stated that he wanted his first interviews to be with youtube personalities who were sympathetic to his situation37 he wrote an oped in the wall street journal detailing the history of the memo and googles reaction followed by interviews for reason magazine reddits iama section cnn cnbc business insider and political commentator ben shapiro2138373940 in response to the memo googles ceo planned an internal town hall meeting fielding questions from employees on inclusivity the meeting was cancelled a short time before it was due to start over safety concerns as our dory questions appeared externally this afternoon and on some websites googlers are now being named personally outlets found to be posting these names with pictures included 4chan breitbart news and milo yiannopouloss blog4142 danielle brown googles vp for diversity was harassed online and temporarily disabled her twitter account31 responsesedit on the scienceedit main article sex differences in psychology responses from scientists who study gender and psychology reflected the controversial nature of the science damore cited43 some commentators in the academic community expressed broad support saying hed gotten the science right such as debra soh a sexual neuroscientist at york university in toronto4445 jordan peterson professor of psychology at the university of toronto446 and lee jussim a professor of social psychology at rutgers university47484950 others said that he got the science wrong relying on data that was suspect outdated or otherwise flawed these included gina rippon chair of cognitive brain imaging at aston university51 adam grant an organizational psychologist at the university of pennsylvania52 evolutionary biologist suzanne sadedin345354 rosalind barnett a psychologist at brandeis university and caryl rivers a professor of journalism at boston university55 journalistic coverage of the science behind the memo reflected these concerns angela saini said that damore failed to understand the research he cited5643 while john horgan criticized the track record of evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics57 owen jones said that the memo was guff dressed up with pseudoscientific jargon and cited a former google employee saying that it failed to grasp the desired qualities of an engineer5859 impact on googleedit prior to his interview with damore steve kovach interviewed a female google employee for business insider who objected to the way the memo lumped all women together saying that it came across as a personal attack60 business insider also reported an increase in the number of women preparing to leave google by interviewing for other jobs61 reporter oliver staley focused on the claim in the memo that men are more competitive than women for innate biological reasons in an article for quartz he pointed to a 2009 economics study which claims to have found evidence against this62 concerns about sexismedit main article sexism in the technology industry in addition to sheryl sandberg who linked to scientific counterarguments a number of other women in technology condemned the memorandum including megan smith a former google vice president63 susan wojcicki ceo of youtube wrote an editorial in which she described feeling devastated about the potential effect of the memo on young women64 laurie leshin president of the worcester polytechnic institute said that she was heartened by the backlash against the memo which gave her hope that things were changing65 kara swisher of recode criticized the memo as sexist66 cynthia b lee a computer science lecturer at stanford university stated that there is ample evidence for bias in tech and that correcting this was more important than whether biological differences might account for a proportion of the numerical imbalances in google and in technology67 cathy young in usa today said that while the memo had legitimate points it probably overstates things while googles reaction to the memo was harmful since it fed into arguments that men are oppressed in modern workplaces68 libertarian author megan mcardle writing for bloomberg view said that damores claims about differing levels of interest between the sexes reflected her own experiences69 christina cauterucci of slate magazine drew parallels between arguments from damores memo and those of mens rights activists70 when eric weinstein announced objection to the firing donna harris wrote about her experiences of sexual harassment in response to his tweet which she felt downplayed the issue71 uc hastings legal scholar joan c williams expressed concerns about prescriptive language used by some diversity training programs and recommended that diversity initiatives be phrased in problem solving terms6 employment law and free speech concernsedit yuki noguchi a reporter for npr said that damores firing has raised questions regarding the limits of free speech in the workplace first amendment free speech protections usually do not extend into the workplace as the first amendment restricts government action but not the actions of private employers and employers have a duty to protect their employees against a hostile work environment72 several employment law experts noted that while damore could challenge his firing in court his potential case would be weak and google would arguably have several defensible reasons for firing him had google not made a substantive response to his memo that could have been cited as evidence of a hostile work environment in lawsuits against google additionally the memo could indicate that damore would be unable to fairly assess or supervise the work of female colleagues73 jim edwards of business insider argued that damore did not have a free speech case for being fired74 however an expert in californian labor law valerie sharpe a labor lawyer based in the san francisco area told business insider that damore could win the case and his chance is above decent75 when discussing with bloomberg the viability of james damores potential claims before the national labor relations board the former chair of the nlrb under president barack obama wilma liebman stated i think its an open question its not a slam dunk either way76 damore hired civil rights lawyer harmeet dhillon who plans to sue google over his firing on august 23 dhillon said she was in talks with current and former google employees gathering facts about working conditions at google particularly for those whose views are inconsistent with google’s political orthodoxy30 cultural commentaryedit margaret wente in the globe and mail assessed that the tone although occasionally injudicious was mild and opined that damore was fired because in the world of liberal dogma all of this is wrongthink77 erick erickson a conservative writer for redstate criticized googles decision to fire damore writing that it showed that views outside leftwing groupthink are not shareable inside google78 david brooks of the new york times who wrote that the medias coverage of the memo has been atrocious criticized googles handling of the controversy he called for sundar pichai to resign as ceo suggesting either pichai is unprepared to understand the research unlikely is not capable of handling complex data flows a bad trait in a ceo or was simply too afraid to stand up to a mob and called danielle browns response ideology obliterating reason4979 in an opinion piece for bloomberg view clive crook accused sundar pichai of adopting a strawman fallacy and wrote that danielle browns decision to denounce the memo without linking to it was a formula straight out of the soviet thoughtcontrol handbook80 in the atlantic conor friedersdorf took issue with the commonly applied label antidiversity and warned that every prominent instance of journalism that proceeds with less than normal rigor when the subject touches on social justice feeds a growing national impulse to dismiss everything published about these subjects9 later he published the viewpoint of english professor alan jacobs opining that sundar pichais reasons for firing damore were ambiguous81 ezra klein contributing to vox suggested that the discussion following the google memo validated a variety of fears held by people across the political spectrum if google—and the tech world more generally—is sexist or in the grips of a totalitarian cult of political correctness or a secret hotbed of altright reactionaries the consequences would be profound82 cnns kirsten powers stated that the memo although flawed bears no relation to the hysterical biased media coverage of it83 several analyses focused more on reactions to the memo than on the memo itself for example jesse singal wrote a memo cant just be offbase or overly simplistic its author has to be a reactionary monster the embodiment of gender inequity in tech84 other commentaryedit peter singer a philosopher best known for utilitarianism drew attention to the seriousness of damores citations but added there are also grounds for questioning some of this research regarding googles firing of damore singer stated it isnt necessary to decide which side is right but only whether damores view is one that a google employee should be permitted to express i think it is85 a harvardharris poll survey showed that 55 percent of those polled said google was wrong to fire damore including 61 percent of republicans 56 percent of independents and 50 percent of democrats86 see alsoedit google portal discrimination portal criticism of google gender disparity in computing sex differences in psychology
