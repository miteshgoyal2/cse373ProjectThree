synopsis of a song of ice and fire power and violence are central themes of game of thrones and the number of weapons made for the series some of which are shown here reflects this setting main article world of a song of ice and fire game of thrones is roughly based on the storylines of a song of ice and fire23 set in the fictional seven kingdoms of westeros and the continent of essos the series chronicles the violent dynastic struggles among the realms noble families for the iron throne while other families fight for independence from it it opens with additional threats in the icy north and essos in the east4 showrunner david benioff jokingly suggested the sopranos in middleearth as game of thrones tagline referring to its intriguefilled plot and dark tone in a fantasy setting of magic and dragons5 in a 2012 study of deaths per episode it ranked second out of 40 recent us tv drama series with an average of 146 themes main article themes in a song of ice and fire the series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism78 george rr martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles political intrigue and the characters believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre91011 martin has stated that the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and dark lords but from ourselves12 a common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil which martin says does not mirror the real world13 just like peoples capacity for good and for evil in real life martin explores the questions of redemption and character change14 the show allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective unlike in many other fantasies and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story1115 benioff said george brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy he introduced gray tones into a blackandwhite universe11 in early seasons under the influence of the a song of ice and fire books main characters were regularly killed off and this was credited with developing tension among viewers16 later seasons however critics pointed out that certain characters had developed plot armor attributing this to the shows deviating from the books and becoming more of a traditional television series16 the series also reflects the substantial death rates in war1718 inspirations and derivations although the first season closely follows the events of the first novel later seasons have made significant changes according to david benioff the show is about adapting the series as a whole and following the map george laid out for us and hitting the major milestones but not necessarily each of the stops along the way19 tom holland of the guardian believes that the novels and their adaptations base aspects of their settings characters and plot on events in european history20 most of westeros is reminiscent of high medieval europe from lands and cultures21 to the palace intrigue feudal system castles and knightly tournaments a principal inspiration for the novels is the english wars of the roses22 1455–85 between the houses of lancaster and york reflected in martins houses of lannister and stark the scheming cersei lannister evokes isabella the shewolf of france 1295–135820 isabella and her family particularly as portrayed in maurice druons historicalnovel series the accursed kings were also a main inspiration for martin23 holland further proposes that other historical antecedents of series elements include hadrians wall which becomes martins wall the legend of atlantis ancient valyria byzantine greek fire wildfire icelandic sagas of the viking age the ironborn the mongol hordes the dothraki the hundred years war 1337–1453 and the italian renaissance c 1400–150020 the series popularity has been attributed in part to martins skill at fusing these elements into a seamless credible version of alternate history20 martin acknowledges i take history and i file off the serial numbers and i turn it up to 1124 cast and characters main

and david benioff created the series wrote most of its episodes and directed several in january 2006 david benioff had a phone conversation with george r r martins literary agent about the books he represented and became interested in a song of ice and fire as he had been a fan of fantasy fiction when young but had not read the books before the literary agent then sent the first four books of a song of ice and fire to benioff32 benioff read a few hundred pages of the first novel a game of thrones shared his enthusiasm with d b weiss and suggested that they adapt martins novels into a television series weiss finished the first novel in maybe 36 hours33 they pitched the series to hbo after a fivehour meeting with martin a veteran screenwriter in a restaurant on santa monica boulevard according to benioff they won martin over with their answer to his question who is jon snows mother34 i had worked in hollywood myself for about 10 years from the late 80s to the 90s id been on the staff of the twilight zone and beauty and the beast all of my first drafts tended to be too big or too expensive i always hated the process of having to cut i said im sick of this im going to write something thats as big as i want it to be and its going to have a cast of characters that go into the thousands and im going to have huge castles and battles and dragons —george r r martin author35 before being approached by benioff and weiss martin had had other meetings with other scriptwriters most of them wanting to turn it into a feature film martin however deemed it unfilmable and impossible to be done as a feature film stating that the size of one of his novels is as long as the lord of the rings which had been adapted as three feature films35 similarly benioff also said that it would be impossible to turn the novels into a feature film as the scale of the novels is too big for a feature film and dozens of characters would have to be discarded benioff added a fantasy movie of this scope financed by a major studio would almost certainly need a pg13 rating that means no sex no blood no profanity fuck that11 martin himself was pleased with the suggestion that they adapt it as an hbo series saying that he never imagined it anywhere else36 i knew it couldnt be done as a network television series its too adult the level of sex and violence would never have gone through35 the series began development in january 20072 hbo acquired the tv rights to the novels with benioff and weiss as its executive producers and martin as a coexecutive producer the intention was for each novel to yield a seasons worth of episodes2 initially martin would write one episode per season while benioff and weiss would write the rest of the episodes237 jane espenson and bryan cogman were later added to write one episode apiece the first season4 the first and second drafts of the pilot script by benioff and weiss were submitted in august 200738 and june 200839 respectively although hbo liked both drafts3940 a pilot was not ordered until november 200841 the 2007–2008 writers guild of america strike may have delayed the process40 the pilot episode winter is coming was first shot in 2009 after a poor reception in a private viewing hbo demanded an extensive reshoot about 90 percent of the episode with cast and directorial changes3442 the pilot reportedly cost hbo 5–10 million to produce43 while the first seasons budget was estimated at 50–60 million44 in the second season the show received a 15percent budget increase for the climactic battle in blackwater which had an 8 million budget4546 between 2012 and 2015 the average budget per episode increased from 6 million47 to at least 8 million48 the sixthseason budget was over 10 million per episode for a season total of over 100 million and a series record49 casting nina gold and robert sterne are the series primary casting directors50 through a process of auditions and readings the main cast was assembled the only exceptions were peter dinklage and sean bean whom the writers wanted from the start they were announced as joining the pilot in 20095152 other actors signed for the pilot were kit harington as jon snow jack gleeson as joffrey baratheon harry lloyd as viserys targaryen and mark addy as robert baratheon5253 addy was according to showrunners benioff and weiss the easiest actor to cast for the show being that his audition was on point54 catelyn stark was scheduled to be played by jennifer ehle but the role was recast with michelle fairley55 daenerys targaryen was also recast with emilia clarke replacing tamzin merchant5657 the rest of the first seasons cast was filled in the second half of 200958 although many of the firstseason cast were set to return the producers had a large number of new characters to cast for the second season due to this benioff and weiss postponed the introduction of several key characters and merged several characters into one or assigned plot functions to different characters25 writing george r r martin author of a song of ice and fire is a series coexecutive producer and wrote one episode for each of the first four seasons game of thrones used seven writers in six seasons series creators david benioff and d b weiss the showrunners write most of the episodes each season59 a song of ice and fire author george r r martin wrote one episode in each of

the writing staff for the fifth season after working as an assistant to benioff and weiss62 although martin is not in the writers room he reads the script outlines and makes comments59 benioff and weiss sometimes assign characters to particular writers for example cogman was assigned to arya stark for the fourth season the writers spend several weeks writing a character outline including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes after these individual outlines are complete they spend another two to three weeks discussing each main characters individual arc and arranging them episode by episode59 a detailed outline is created with each of the writers working on a portion to create a script for each episode cogman who wrote two episodes for the fifth season took a month and a half to complete both scripts they are then read by benioff and weiss who make notes and parts of the script are rewritten all ten episodes are written before filming begins since they are filmed out of order with two units in different countries59 benioff and weiss write each of their episodes together with one of them writing the first half of the script and the other the

rings film trilogy and the harry potter films establishing fantasy as a massmarket genre they are gateway drugs to fantasy fan culture186 its success in the face of its genre was attributed by writers

hollywood reporter 2012209210211 the performances of the cast have also been praised peter dinklages charming morally ambiguous and selfaware212 tyrion who earned him emmy and golden globe awards was noted in many ways game of thrones belongs to dinklage wrote mary mcnamara of the la times before tyrion became the series central figure in season two213214 several critics highlighted performances by actresses213 and children215 fourteenyearold maisie williams noted in the first season for her debut as arya stark was singled out for her seasontwo work with veteran actor charles dance tywin lannister216 firstseason reviewers said the series had high production values a fully realized world and compelling characters217 according to variety there may be no show more profitable to its network than game of thrones is to hbo fully produced by the pay cabler and already a global phenomenon after only one season the fantasy skein was a gamble that has paid off handsomely218 the second season was also well received by critics entertainment weekly praised its vivid vital and just plain fun storytelling219 and according to the hollywood reporter the show made a strong case for being one of tvs best series its seriousness made it the only drama comparable to mad men or breaking bad220 the new york times gave the series a mixed review criticizing its number of characters their lack of complexity and a meandering plot221 the third season was very well received by critics with metacritic giving it a score of 91 out of 100 indicating universal acclaim200 the fourth season was also praised metacritic gave it a score of 94 out of 100 based on 29 reviews again indicating universal acclaim202 the fifth season was also well received by critics and has a score of 91 out of 100 based

reviews205 after the first episode aired the seventh season held a rating of 97 percent on rotten tomatoes with an average score of 82 out of 10 based on 29 reviews207 sex and violence despite its otherwise enthusiastic reception by critics game of thrones has been criticized for the amount of female nudity violence and sexual violence especially against women it depicts and for the manner in which it depicts these themes the atlantic called the series tendency to ramp up the sex violence and—especially—sexual violence of the source material the defining weakness of the adaptation222 george r r martin responded that he feels obliged to be truthful about history and human nature and that rape and sexual violence are common in war and that omitting them from the narrative would have rung false and undermined one of his novels themes its historical realism12 hbo said that they fully support the vision and artistry of dan and david’s exceptional work and we feel this work speaks for itself12 the amount of sex and nudity in the series especially in scenes that are incidental to the plot was the focus of much of the criticism aimed at the series in its first and second seasons stephen dillane who portrays stannis baratheon likened the series frequent explicit scenes to german porn from the 1970s223 charlie anders wrote in io9 that while the first season was replete with lighthearted sexposition the second season appeared to focus on distasteful exploitative and dehumanizing sex with little informational content224 according to the washington posts anna holmes the nude scenes appeared to be aimed mainly at titillating heterosexual men right down to the brazilian waxes sported by the women in the series fauxmedieval setting which made these scenes alienating to other viewers225 the huffington posts maureen ryan likewise noted that game of thrones mostly presented women naked rather than men and that the excess of random boobage undercut any aspirations the series might have to address the oppression of women in a feudal society226 saturday night live parodied this aspect of the adaptation in a sketch that portrayed the series as retaining a thirteenyearold boy as a consultant whose main concern was showing as many breasts as possible224227 in the third season which saw theon greyjoy lengthily tortured and eventually emasculated the series was also criticized for its use of torture228 new york magazine called the scene torture porn229 madeleine davies of jezebel agreed saying its not uncommon that game of thrones gets accused of being torture porn—senseless objectifying violence combined with senseless objectifying sexual imagery according to davies although the series violence tended to serve a narrative purpose theons torture in the bear and the maiden fair was excessive230 a scene in the fourth seasons episode breaker of chains in which jaime lannister rapes his sister and lover cersei triggered a broad public discussion about the series depiction of sexual violence against women according to dave itzkoff of the new york times the scene caused outrage in part because of comments by director alex graves that the scene became consensual by the end itzkoff also wrote that critics fear that rape has become so pervasive in the drama that it is almost background noise a routine and unshocking occurrence12 sonia saraiya of the av club wrote that the series choice to portray this sexual act and a similar one between daenerys targaryen and khal drogo in the first season—both described as consensual in the source novels—as a rape appeared to be an act of exploitation for shock value231 in the fifth seasons episode unbowed unbent unbroken sansa stark is raped by ramsay bolton most reviewers including those from vanity fair salon the atlantic and the daily beast found the scene gratuitous and artistically unnecessary222232233234 for example joanna robinson writing for vanity fair said that the scene undercuts all the agency thats been growing in sansa since the end of last season235 in contrast sara stewart of the new york post wondered why viewers were not similarly upset about the many background and minor characters whod undergone similar or worse treatment236 in response to the scene pop culture website the mary sue announced that it would cease coverage of the series because of the repeated use of rape as a plot device237 and us senator claire mccaskill said that she would no longer watch it238 as the sixth and seventh seasons saw daenerys sansa and cersei assume ruling positions alyssa rosenberg of the washington post noted that the series could be seen as a longarc revenge fantasy about what happens when women who have been brutalized and raped gain power—namely that their past leaves them too broken to do anything but commit brutal acts in their own turn and that their personal liberation does not effect the social change needed to protect others from suffering239 fandom main article a song of ice and fire fandom in this manipulated image published by the white house us president barack obama a fan of the series sits on the iron throne in the oval
