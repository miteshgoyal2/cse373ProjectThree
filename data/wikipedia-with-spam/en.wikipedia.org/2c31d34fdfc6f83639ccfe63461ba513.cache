around lake washington to the east of seattle was first settled by native americans english settlers arrived in the late 1860s when the mcgregor and popham families built homesteads in what is now the houghton neighborhood four miles 6 km to the north people also settled near what is now called juanita bay a favored campsite of the natives because a wild potato wapatos thrived there the curtis family arrived in the area in the 1870s followed by the french family in 1872 the forbes family homesteaded what is now juanita beach park in 18767 and settled on rose hill in 1877 gradually additional people settled in the area and by the end of the 1880s a small number of logging farming and boatbuilding communities were established8 kirkland in 1912 at the modernday intersection of fourth avenue and first street overlooking lake washington in 1886 peter kirk a britishborn enterprising businessman seeking to expand the family’s moss bay steel production company moved to washington after hearing that iron deposits had been discovered in the cascade mountain range other necessary components such as limestone needed in steel smelting were readily available in the area further yet a small number of coalmines a required fuel source for steel mills had recently been established nearby in newcastle and train lines were already under construction plans were also underway to build the lake washington ship canal kirk realized that if a town were built near the water it would be a virtual freshwater port to the sea as well as help support any prospective mill at the time however kirk was not a us citizen and could not purchase any land leigh s j hunt then owner of the seattle postintelligencer offered to partner with kirk and buy the necessary real estate under their new venture the kirkland land and development company kirk and hunt purchased thousands of acres of land in what is now kirkland’s downtown in july 1888 kirk and his associates started the construction of a new steel mill soon after named moss bay iron and steel company of america after founding the city of kirkland in 1888 officially one of the earliest on the eastside at the time kirk’s vision of a pittsburgh of the west was beginning to take form construction soon commenced on several substantial brick homes and business blocks that would house and serve the steel mill employees map of kirkland in 2006 prior to annexations however the seattle lake shore and eastern railway which had recently been purchased by tacomabased northern pacific had now refused to construct a rail line to the lake this would after all have a negative impact on tacoma which was furiously competing with seattle as the dominant puget sound seaport the ensuing financial issues and numerous obstacles took a toll on kirk who was running out of investors hunt was also in debt from the purchase of land nevertheless the plans continued and the steel mill was eventually completed in late 1892 on rose hill a full two miles 3 km from the lakes shore financial issues arose and due to the panic of 1893 the mill subsequently closed without ever producing any steel in spite of everything kirk was determined not to give up on his namesake town and kirkland was finally incorporated in 1905 with a population of approximately 532 a final attempt at a steel mill in kirkland was planned by james a moore in 1906 his company the northwestern iron steel company paid 250000 in cash for a 1500acre 61 km2 site but the mill never materialized this came at the heels of the pacific steel company incorporated earlier in 1906 by jf duthie william calvert and ls cragin this company soon amounted to nothing in 1900 the curtis family made a living operating a ferryconstruction business on lake washington along with captain john anderson the curtises were among the first to run ferries in the area leschi first operated on december 27 1913 was the original wooden ferry to transport automobiles and people between the eastside and madison park until her retirement in 1950 the ferry operations ran nearly continuously for 18 hours each day the construction of the first lake washington floating bridge in 1940 however made ferry service unprofitable and eventually led to its cancellation9 subsequent years saw wool milling and warship building become the major industries the first woolen mill in the state of washington was built in kirkland in 1892 the mill was the primary supplier of wool products for the alaska gold rush prospectors and for the us military during world war icitation needed by 1917 after the completion of the lake washington ship canal the construction of oceangoing vessels had become a major business by 1940 the thriving lake washington shipyard had constructed more than 25 warships during world war ii for the us navy on what is now carillon point annexationsedit kirkland annexations annexation date sq mi annexed cumulative sq mi

the county10 as well as a state sales tax incentive intended to ease the process11 three previously unincorporated districts north of the city—finn hill juanita and kingsgate—voted on whether to annex to kirkland the measure failed by seven votes to reach the 60 margin which was required because the measure included accepting a share of the citys voterapproved debt12 however since the affirmative vote was over 50 the city council could and did vote to accept the annexation without the assumption of debt 13 the annexation added 33000 residents combined total population of around 8000014 and
