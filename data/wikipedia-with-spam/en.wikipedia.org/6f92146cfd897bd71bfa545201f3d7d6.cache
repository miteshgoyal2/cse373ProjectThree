joseph k c forrest publishing the first edition on june 10 1847 numerous changes in ownership and editorship took place over the next eight years initially the tribune was not politically affiliated but tended to support either the whig or free soil parties against the democrats in elections5 by late 1853 it was frequently running xenophobic editorials that criticized foreigners and roman catholics6 about this time it also became a strong proponent of temperance7 however nativist its editorials may have been it was not until february 10 1855 that the tribune formally affiliated itself with the nativist american or know nothing party whose candidate levi boone was elected mayor of chicago the following month8 an 1870 advertisement for chicago tribune subscriptions medill editorshipedit by about 1854 partowner capt j d webster later general webster and chief of staff at the battle of shiloh and dr charles h ray of galena illinois through horace greeley convinced joseph medill of clevelands leader to become managing editor ray became editorinchief medill became the managing editor and alfred cowles sr brother of edwin cowles initially was the bookkeeper each purchased one third of the tribune910 under their leadership the tribune distanced itself from the know nothings and became the main chicago organ of the republican party11 however the paper continued to print anticatholic and antiirish editorials in the wake of the massive famine immigration from ireland12 the tribune absorbed three other chicago publications under the new editors the free west in 1855 the democratic press of william bross in 1858 and the chicago democrat in 1861 whose editor john wentworth left his position when elected as mayor of chicago between 1858 and 1860 the paper was known as the chicago press tribune on october 25 1860 it became the chicago daily tribune13 before and during the american civil war the new editors strongly supported abraham lincoln whom medill helped secure the presidency in 1860 and pushed an abolitionist agenda the paper remained a force in republican politics for years afterwards the lead editorial in the first issue the chicago tribune published after the great chicago fire in 1861 the tribune published new lyrics by william w patton for the song john browns body these rivaled the lyrics published two months later by julia ward howe medill served as mayor of chicago for one term after the great chicago fire of 1871 years of mccormickedit under the 20thcentury editorship of colonel robert r mccormick who took control in the 1920s the paper was strongly isolationist and aligned with the old right in its coverage of political news and social trends it used the motto the american paper for americans through the 1930s to the 1950s it excoriated the democrats and the new deal of franklin d roosevelt was resolutely disdainful of the british and french and greatly enthusiastic for chiang kaishek and sen joseph mccarthy when mccormick assumed the position of coeditor with his cousin joseph medill patterson in 1910 the tribune was the thirdbestselling paper among chicagos eight dailies with a circulation of only 18800014 the young cousins added features such as advice columns and homegrown comic strips such as little orphan annie and moon mullins they promoted political crusades with their first success coming with the ouster of the republican political boss of illinois sen william lorimer14 at the same time the tribune competed with the hearst paper the chicago examiner in a circulation war by 1914 the cousins succeeded in forcing out managing editor william keeley by 1918 the examiner was forced to merge with the chicago herald tribune in 1919 in 1919 patterson left the tribune and moved to new york to launch his own newspaper the new york daily news14 in a renewed circulation war with hearsts heraldexaminer mccormick and hearst ran rival lotteries in 1922 the tribune won the battle adding 250000 readers to its ranks also in 1922 the chicago tribune hosted an international design competition for its new headquarters the tribune tower the competition worked brilliantly as a publicity stunt and more than 260 entries were received the winner was a neogothic design by new york architects john mead howells and raymond hood the newspaper sponsored a pioneering attempt at arctic aviation in 1929 an attempted roundtrip to europe across greenland and iceland in a sikorsky amphibious aircraft15 but the aircraft was destroyed by ice on july 15 1929 near ungava bay at the tip of labrador canada the crew were rescued by the canadian science ship css acadia16 from 1940 to 1943 the paper supplemented its comic strip offerings with the chicago tribune comic book responding to the new success of comic books at the same time it launched the more successful and longer lasting the spirit section which was also an attempt by newspapers to compete with the new medium17 during the mccormick years the tribune was a champion of modified spelling for simplicity such as spelling although as altho1819 mccormick a vigorous campaigner for the republican party died in 1955 just four days before democratic boss richard j daley was elected mayor for the first time one of the great scoops in tribune history came when it obtained the text of the treaty of versailles in june 1919 another was its revelation of united states war plans on the eve of the pearl harbor attack the tribunes june 7 1942 front page announcement that the united states had broken japans naval code was the revelation by the paper of a closely guarded military secret20 the story revealing that americans broke the enemy naval codes was not cleared by censors and had us president franklin d roosevelt so enraged that he considered shutting down the tribune21222324 1948 us presidential electionedit truman was widely expected to lose the 1948 election and the chicago tribune ran the incorrect headline dewey defeats truman the paper is well known for a mistake it made during the 1948 presidential election at that time much of its composing room staff was on strike the early returns led editors to believe along with many in the country that the republican candidate thomas dewey would win an early edition of the next days paper carried the headline dewey defeats truman turning the paper into a collectors item democrat harry s truman won and proudly brandished the newspaper in a famous picture taken at st louis union station beneath the headline was a false article written by arthur sears henning which purported to describe west coast results although written before east coast election returns were available the tribunes legendary sports editor arch ward created the major league baseball allstar game in 1933 as part of the citys century of progress exposition the tribunes reputation for innovation extended to radio—it bought an early station wdap in 1924 and renamed it wgn am the station call

mccormick prevented the tribune for years from participating in the pulitzer prize competition but it has won 25 of the awards over the years including many for editorial writing252627 the tribune won its first postmccormick pulitzer in 1961 when carey orr won the award for editorial cartooning reporter george bliss won a pulitzer the following year for reporting and reporter bill jones another in

began reporting from a wider viewpoint the paper retained its republican and conservative perspective in its editorials but it began to publish perspectives in wider commentary that represented a spectrum of diverse opinions while its news reporting no longer had the conservative slant it had in the mccormick years in early 1974 in a major feat of journalism the tribune published the complete 246000word text of the watergate tapes in a 44page supplement that hit the streets 24 hours after the transcripts release by the nixon white house not only was the tribune the first newspaper to publish the transcripts but it beat the us government printing offices published version and made headlines doing soclarification needed a week later after studying the transcripts the papers editorial board observed that the high dedication to grand principles that americans have a right to expect from a president is missing from the transcript record the tribunes editors concluded that nobody of sound mind can read the transcripts and continue to think that mr nixon has upheld the standards and dignity of the presidency and called for nixons resignation the tribune call for nixon to resign made news reflecting not only the change in the type of conservatism practiced by the paper but as a watershed event in terms of nixons hopes for survival in office the white house reportedly perceived the tribunes editorial as a loss of a longtime supporter and as a blow to nixons hopes to weather the scandal on december 7 1975 kirkpatrick announced in a column on the editorial page that rick soll a young and talented columnist for the paper whose work had won a following among many tribune readers over the last two years had resigned from the paper he had acknowledged that a november 23 1975 column he wrote contained verbatim passages written by another columnist in 1967 and later published in a collection kirkpatrick did not identify the columnist the passages in question kirkpatrick wrote were from a notebook where soll regularly entered words phrases and bits of conversation which he had wished to remember the paper initially suspended soll for a month without pay kirkpatrick wrote that further evidence was revealed came out that another of solls columns contained information which he knew was false at that point tribune editors decided to accept the resignation offered by soll when the internal investigation began28 after leaving soll married pam zekman a chicago newspaper and future tv reporter he worked for the shortlived chicago times magazine
