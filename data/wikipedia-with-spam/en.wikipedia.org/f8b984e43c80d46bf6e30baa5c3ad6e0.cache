hurt tito on “we can change the world jackie on “wait and marlon on “body” jermaine only sings colead vocals with michael on torture he also performs adlibs on wait and is additionally named as a background vocalist on one more chance and the hurt torture was originally planned to be a duet between michael and jackie the songs writer but when jermaine officially rejoined the group he took over the parts intended for jackie who can still be heard during the songs chorus and adlibs the album only had two videos — for the songs torture and body — and neither jermaine nor michael appeared in
