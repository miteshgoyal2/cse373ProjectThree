1979 he served as special counsel and ultimately as chief of staff for the thennew senator daniel moynihan growing dissatisfaction with president carters foreign policy led abrams to support ronald reagan in the 1980 presidential election9 through senator moynihan abrams was introduced to rachel decter the stepdaughter of moynihans friend norman podhoretz editor of commentary they were married from 1980 until her death in june 2013 the couple had three children jacob sarah and joseph10 assistant secretary of state 1980sedit abrams first came to national prominence when he served as reagans assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs in the early 1980s and later as assistant secretary for interamerican affairs his nomination to assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs was unanimously approved by the senate foreign relations committee on november 17 198111 abrams was reagans second choice for the position his first nominee ernest w lefever had been rejected by the senate foreign relations committee on june 5 198111 ronald reagan and elliott abrams 1981 during this time abrams clashed regularly with church groups and human rights organizations including human rights watch12 according to the washington post article in a 1984 appearance on the program nightline abrams clashed with aryeh neier13 the executive director of human rights watch14 and with the leader of amnesty international over the reagan administrations foreign policies they accused him of covering up atrocities committed by the military forces of usbacked governments such as those in el salvador honduras and guatemala and the rebel contras in nicaragua el salvadoredit in early 1982 when reports of the el mozote massacre of hundreds of civilians by the military in el salvador began appearing in us media abrams told a senate committee that the reports of hundreds of deaths at el mozote were not credible and that it appears to be an incident that is at least being significantly misused at the very best by the guerrillas15 the massacre had come at a time when the reagan administration was attempting to bolster the human rights image of the salvadoran military abrams implied that reports of a massacre were simply fmln propaganda and denounced us investigative reports of the massacre as misleading in march 1993 the salvadoran truth commission reported that over 500 civilians were deliberately and systematically executed in el mozote in december 1981 by forces affiliated with the salvadoran government16 also in 1993 documentation emerged suggesting that some reagan administration officials could have known about el mozote and other human rights violations from the beginning17 however in july 1993 an investigation commissioned by clinton secretary of state warren christopher into the state departments activities and conduct with regard to human rights in el salvador during the reagan years found that despite us funding of the salvadoran government that committed the massacre at el mozote individual us personnel performed creditably and occasionally with personal bravery in advancing human rights in el salvador18 unrepentant reaganite abrams claimed that washingtons policy in el salvador was a fabulous achievement19 nicaraguaedit when congress shut down funding for the contras efforts to overthrow nicaraguas sandinista government with the 1982 boland amendment members of the reagan administration began looking for other avenues for funding the group20 congress opened a couple of such avenues when it modified the boland amendment for fiscal year 1986 by approving 27 million in direct aid to the contras and allowing the administration to legally solicit funds for the contras from foreign governments21 neither the direct aid nor any foreign contributions could be used to purchase weapons21 guided by the new provisions of the modified boland amendment abrams flew to london in august 1986 and met secretly with bruneian defense minister general ibnu to solicit a 10million contribution from the sultan of brunei2223 ultimately the contras never received this money because a clerical error in oliver norths office a mistyped account number sent the bruneian money to the wrong swiss bank account22 irancontra affair and convictionsedit during investigation of the irancontra affair lawrence walsh the independent counsel tasked with investigating the case prepared multiple felony counts against abrams but never indicted him22 instead abrams cooperated with walsh and entered into a plea agreement wherein he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of withholding information from congress24 he was sentenced to a 50 fine probation for two years and 100 hours of community service abrams was pardoned by president george h w bush in december 1992 on february 5 1997 the dc court of appeals publicly censured abrams for giving false testimony on three occasions before congressional committees although a majority of the court voted to impose a public censure three judges in the majority would have imposed a suspension of six months and a fourth judge would have followed the recommendation of the board on professional responsibility that abrams be suspended for a yearcitation needed special assistant to president bushedit president george w bush appointed abrams to the post of special assistant to the president and senior director for democracy human rights and international operations at the national security council on june 25 200125 abrams was appointed special assistant to the president and the nscs senior director for near east and north african affairs on december 2 200226 some human rights groups and commentators considered his white house appointment repugnant due to his conviction in the iran–contra affair investigation and his role in overseeing the reagan administrations foreign policy in latin america which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands2728 in this capacity abrams played an important role in us–israel relations in an unannounced visit to ariel sharon in rome in 2003 abrams was the first member of the us government to discover that israel planned to pull out of gaza abrams was also witness to the growing tension between the two governments on account of the us effort to find a comprehensive peace settlement as abrams puts it what was not in the newspapers is the tension that is growing between the us and israel over this because we are constantly asking in my view for israeli concessions to kind of oil this mechanism of peace and the israelis are getting tired of it and they think you know this is not the way an ally should act bush is kind of above this with the prime minister so this is really condi with the israeli cabinet and the prime minister29 the observer has claimed that abrams had advance knowledge of and gave a nod to the venezuelan coup attempt of 2002 against hugo chávez30 advisor for global democracy strategyedit on february 2 2005 president george w bush appointed abrams deputy national security adviser for global democracy strategy31 where he served until the end of his

discussions relating to the 2006 israellebanon conflict32 2016presentedit on may 16 2016 abrams wrote a historical piece33 denouncing donald trump in which he drew parallels between the 2016 election to the 1972 election on december 23 2016 abrams a strong supporter of israel criticized obama for undermining israels elected government prevent its action against irans nuclear weapons program and
