settlement6 the town of skykomish was officially incorporated on june 5 1909 from the 1890s to 1974 skykomish was a maintenance and fueling station for the great northern railway which eventually became part of the burlington northern railroad and presently the bnsf railway it was also once the western terminus for electric operations 1909–56 on the cascade tunnel route all the way to wenatchee here steam or diesel locomotives were changed or coupled to electric locomotives7 waste disposal practices common during that era resulted in the contamination of its soil its groundwater and the skykomish river by oil and heavy metals bnsf then bn and the washington state department of ecology began remediation discussions in the mid1980s and in 2006 agreed to a plan whereby the railroad would pay up to 50 million to clean up the area over a threeyear period completed in 2009 this effort involved massive excavations—essentially removing the contaminated soil and replacing it with clean soil—and the rebuilding of a levee the eventual total cost of the cleanup exceeded 100 million twenty two of skykomishs buildings — both homes and business — were temporarily moved during the cleanup process after the contaminated soil under them was removed the buildings were moved back to their original locations on new foundations and utilities connections the town was restored with modern conveniences such as sidewalks and street lights but the historic character of skykomish was maintained the greatest benefit of the cleanup to every resident and business in town was the installation of the new waste water treatment system connected to every building geographyedit skykomish is located at 47°42′36″n 121°21′21″w﻿ ﻿4771000°n 12135583°w﻿ 4771000 12135583 47710048
