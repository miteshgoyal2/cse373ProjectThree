federal way purchased a downtown lot formerly used by a defunct amc theatres cinema and invited proposals from two developers united properties and alpert capital to develop a multiuse tower project in the downtown core adjacent to the recently built transit center such a project follows in the steps of similar multiuse developments such as kent station in nearby kent the city awarded the contract to united properties symphony project comprising four 15–22 story towers including 60000 square feet 5600 m2 of retail and office space 900 housing units and a large downtown park which would be relinquished to the city transfer of the land to united properties followed by construction of the first tower was scheduled to start in mid2008citation needed however in july 2008 united properties requested a oneyear extension on the terms of the purchase agreement citing difficulties in the credit and housing markets to acquire the necessary funds11 in august 2009 united suggested scrapping the symphony plan and instead building a performing arts center on the property a proposal the city rejected12 in september 2009 the south korean development firm lander korus joined onto the project with united13 korus proposed adding asian elements to the building in order to attract investment and interest from the citys influential korean population and foreign investment however by july 2010 after having granted united and korus five extensions to close on the project the city transferred the deal to another korean developer twin development14 which had planned a similar project on another lot the new developer brings a new design with two 45story and one 35story mixeduse towers as of 2011 the new developers have yet to close on the property citing financing difficulties and have received the seventh extension on the land from the city which expired on march 201115 the developers are banking on the citys recently granted eb5 visa qualification to encourage foreign investment in exchange for permanent resident status16 as of february 1 2011 this deal is also dead as the developer failed to make a required escrow deposit by the end of january17 in 2011 the city renewed its request for quotes for the undeveloped site and received three proposals the city ultimately chose a proposal by arcadd known as the crystal palace a densely packed glass multitower structure where some of the towers bend outward near the top under 20 stories with a larger retail and public space pavilion at the base18 the developers however were unable to obtain the funds by the initial deadline after extending the deadline eight months to allow arcadd to obtain the necessary earnest money and still seeing no progress the city decided to move on with a different plan19 as of may 2013 plans for a downtown park and plaza complex were underway20 in 2014 the lot was repaved leaving the amc theaters building foundation in place but filling inside its permiter with sod the lot was rechristened town square park and opened in early 2014 a plan for a more permanent park design on the site is being considered to the north of the downtown park an elevated lot which was formerly the location of a toys r us store has been purchased by the city which is slated to host a planned performing arts and civic center pacc the pacc proposal has been controversial largely over funding and selfsustaining concerns a similar city project the federal way community center opened in 2007 ran for most of its operational history in the red but has the support of city leaders also in 2014 ahead of veterans day the city introduced a 60foot 18 m flagpole on south 320th st between pacific highway south and 20th avenue south21 the pole holds a 15 by 25 foot 76 x 46 m flag22 while intended to be officially raised on veterans day a smaller flag was raised to half mast on the pole in late october in memory to state representative roger freeman who died october 29 of that year the portion of south 320th street from pacific highway to interstate 5 was dualnamed veterans way also in honor of veterans governmentedit the federal way city council consists of seven atlarge

include star lake and camelot neighborhoods in lakeland north also the neighborhoods of parkland lakeland and jovita in lakeland south all of these neighborhoods are located east of the city proper in 2004 the city annexed the northlake east redondo and parkway neighborhoods into the city adding over 2700 people and nearly 1 square mile 257 km² of area while federal way had previously considered auburns west hill auburn annexed that along with lea hill in 2007 in february 2007 the city announced formal plans to annex the majority of unincorporated land on its east border as one paa named east federal way comprising the star lake camelot lakeland and jovita neighborhoods2425 and a strip of peasley canyon road connecting the two areas annexation of the area would add 20000 people and nearly 7 sq mi 18 km² to the city creating the 6th largest city in washington by population at over 106000 residents and nearly 29 sq mi 75 km2 75 km²26 on august 21 2007 residents of the proposed east federal way annexation area rejected annexation to federal way by a 66 to 34 margin27 opponents of the plan favoring remaining under direct king county government asserted fears that increased density and higher taxes would result from annexation despite proponents showing studies that taxes and fees would be unchanged28 in 2011 opponents of annexation petitioned king county to designate this same area as a township a municipal structure that does not currently exist anywhere else in the state but which the state constitution provides for under the plan township status would prevent the annexation of the area which would be named peasley canyon township29 the king county council declined to act on the proposal and the county elections board denied the group a ballot item30
