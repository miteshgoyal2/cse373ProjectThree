history on august 20 1920 a meeting was held by representatives of the akron pros canton bulldogs cleveland indians rock island independents and dayton triangles at the jordan and hupmobile auto showroom in canton ohio8 this meeting resulted in the formation of the american professional football conference apfc a group who according to the canton evening repository intended to raise the standard of professional football in every way possible to eliminate bidding for players between rival clubs and to secure cooperation in the formation of schedules9 another meeting held on september 17 1920 resulted in the renaming of the league to the american professional football association apfa9 the league hired jim thorpe as its first president and consisted of 14 teams only two of these teams the decatur staleys now the chicago bears and the chicago cardinals now the arizona cardinals remain10 the akron pros won the first apfa nfl championship although the league did not maintain official standings for its 1920 inaugural season and teams played schedules that included nonleague opponents the apfa awarded the akron pros the championship by virtue of their 8–0–3 8 wins 0 losses and 3 ties record11 the first event occurred on september 26 1920 when the rock island independents defeated the nonleague st paul ideals 48–0 at douglas park812 on october 3 1920 the first full week of league play occurred1314 the following season resulted in the chicago staleys controversially winning the title over the buffalo allamericans15 on june 24 1922 the apfa changed its name to the national football league nfl1617 in 1932 the season ended with the chicago bears 6–1–6 and the portsmouth spartans 6–1–4 tied for first in the league standings18 at the time teams were ranked on a single table and the team with the highest winning percentage not including ties which were not counted towards the standings at the end of the season was declared the champion the only tiebreaker was that in the event of a tie if two teams played twice in a season the result of the second game determined the title the source of the 1921 controversy this method had been used since the leagues creation in 1920 but no situation had been encountered where two teams were tied for first the league quickly determined that a playoff game between chicago and portsmouth was needed to decide the leagues champion the teams were originally scheduled to play the playoff game officially a regular season game that would count towards the regular season standings at wrigley field in chicago but a combination of heavy snow and extreme cold forced the game to be moved indoors to chicago stadium which did not have a regulationsize football field playing with altered rules to accommodate the smaller playing field the bears won the game 9–0 and thus won the championship fan interest in the de facto championship game led the nfl beginning in 1933 to split into two divisions with a championship game to be played between the division champions19 the 1934 season also marked the first of 12 seasons in which african americans were absent from the league the de facto ban was rescinded in 1946 following public pressure and coinciding with the removal of a similar ban in major league baseball20 the nfl was always the foremost professional football league in the united states it nevertheless faced a large number of rival professional leagues through the 1930s and 1940s rival leagues included at least three separate american football leagues and the allamerica football conference aafc on top of various regional leagues of varying caliber three nfl teams trace their histories to these rival leagues including the los angeles rams who came from a 1936 iteration of the american football league the cleveland browns and san francisco 49ers the last two of which came from the aafc by the 1950s the nfl had an effective monopoly on professional football in the united states its only competition in north america was the professional canadian football circuit which formally became the canadian football league cfl in 1958 with canadian football being a different football code than the american game the cfl established a niche market in canada and still survives as an independent league a new professional league the fourth american football league afl began play in 1960 the upstart afl began to challenge the established nfl in popularity gaining lucrative television contracts and engaging in a bidding war with the nfl for free agents and draft picks the two leagues announced a merger on june 8 1966 to take full effect in 1970 in the meantime the leagues would hold a common draft and championship game the game the super bowl was held four times before the merger with the nfl winning super bowl i and super bowl ii and the afl winning super bowl iii and super bowl iv21 after the league merged it was reorganized into two conferences the national football conference nfc consisting of most of the premerger nfl teams and the american football conference afc consisting of all of the afl teams as well as three premerger nfl teams22 today the nfl is consideredclarification needed the most popular sports league in north america much of its growth is attributed to former commissioner pete rozelle who led the league from 1960 to 1989 overall annual attendance increased from three million at the beginning of his tenure to seventeen million by the end of his tenure and 400 million viewers watched 1989s super bowl xxiii the nfl established nfl properties in 1963 the leagues licensing wing nfl properties earns the league billions of dollars annually rozelles tenure also marked the creation of nfl charities and a national partnership with united way23 paul tagliabue was elected as commissioner to succeed rozelle his seventeenyear tenure which ended in 2006 was marked by large increases in television contracts and the addition of four expansion teams24 as well as the introduction of league initiatives to increase the number of minorities in league and team management roles25 the leagues current commissioner roger goodell has focused on reducing the number of illegal hits and making the sport safer mainly through fining or suspending players who break rules26 these actions are among many the nfl is taking to reduce concussions and improve player safety27 season and playoff development main article list of national football league seasons from 1920 to 1934 the nfl did not have a set number of games for teams to play instead setting a minimum the league mandated a 12game regular season for each team beginning in 1935 later shortening this to 11 games in 1937 and 10 games in 1943 mainly due to world war ii after the war ended the number of games returned to 11 games in 1946 and to 12 in 1947 the nfl went to a 14game schedule in 1961 which it retained until switching to the current 16game schedule in 197828 proposals to increase the regular season to 18 games have been made but have been rejected in labor negotiations with the national football league players association nflpa29 the nfl operated in a twoconference system from 1933 to 1966 where the champions of each conference would meet in the nfl championship game if two teams tied for the conference lead they would meet in a onegame playoff to determine the conference champion in 1967 the nfl expanded from 15 teams to 16 teams instead of just evening out the conferences by adding the expansion new orleans saints to the sevenmember western conference the nfl realigned the conferences and split each into two fourteam divisions the four division champions would meet in the nfl playoffs a tworound playoff30 the nfl also operated the playoff bowl officially the bert bell benefit bowl from 1960 to 1969 effectively a thirdplace game pitting the two conference runnersup against each other the league considers playoff bowls to have been exhibitions rather than playoff games the league discontinued the playoff bowl in 1970 due to its perception as a game for losers31 following the addition of the former afl teams into the nfl in 1970 the nfl split into two conferences with three divisions each the expanded league now with twentysix teams22 would also feature an expanded eightteam eight playoff the participants being the three division champions from each conference as well as one wild card team the team with the best win percentage from each conference in 1978 the league added a second wild card team from each conference bringing the total number of playoff teams to ten and a further two wild card teams were added in 1990 to bring the total to twelve when the nfl expanded to 32 teams in 2002 the league realigned changing the division structure from three divisions in each conference to four divisions in each conference as each division champion gets a playoff bid the number of wild card teams from each conference dropped from three to two32 corporate structure see also history of the nfl commissioner nfl commissioner roger goodell at the corporate level the national football league considers itself a trade association made up of and financed by its 32 member teams33 up until 2015 the league was an unincorporated nonprofit 501c6 association34 section 501c6 of the internal revenue code provides an exemption from federal income taxation for business leagues chambers of commerce realestate boards boards of trade or professional football leagues whether or not administering a pension fund for football players not organized for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual35 in contrast each individual team except the nonprofit green bay packers36 is subject to tax because they make a profit37 the nfl gave up the tax exempt status in 2015 following public criticism in a letter to the club owners commissioner roger goodell labeled it a distraction saying the effects of the tax exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years every dollar of income generated through television rights fees licensing agreements sponsorships ticket sales and other means is earned by the 32 clubs and is taxable there this will remain the case even when the league office and management council file returns as taxable entities and the change in filing status will make no material difference to our business as a result the league office might owe around us10 million in income taxes but it is no longer required to disclose the salaries of its executive officers38 the league has three defined officers the commissioner secretary and treasurer each conference has one defined officer the president which is essentially an honorary position with few powers and mostly ceremonial duties such as awarding the conference championship trophy the commissioner is elected by affirmative vote of twothirds or 18 whichever is greater of the members of the league while the president of each conference is elected by an affirmative vote of threefourths or ten of the conference members39 the commissioner appoints the secretary and treasurer and has broad authority in disputes between clubs players coaches and employees he is the principal executive officer40 of the nfl and also has authority in hiring league employees negotiating television contracts disciplining individuals that own part or all of an nfl team clubs or employed individuals of an nfl club if they have violated league bylaws or committed conduct detrimental to the welfare of the league or professional football40 the commissioner can in the event of misconduct by a party associated with the league suspend individuals hand down a fine of up to us500000 cancel contracts with the league and award or strip teams of draft picks40 in extreme cases the commissioner can offer recommendations to the nfls executive committee up to and including the cancellation or forfeiture40 of a clubs franchise or any other action he deems necessary the commissioner can also issue sanctions up to and including a lifetime ban from the league if an individual connected to the nfl has bet on games or failed to notify the league of conspiracies or plans to bet on or fix games40 the current commissioner of the national football league is roger goodell who was elected in 2006 after paul tagliabue the previous commissioner retired41 according to economist richard wolff the nfl redistributes its wealth to all nfl teams equally in contravention of the typical corporate structure by redistributing profits to all teams the nfl is ensuring that one team will not dominate the league through excessive earnings42

preseason games are exhibition matches and do not count towards regularseason totals67 because the preseason does not count towards standings teams generally do not focus on winning games instead they are used by coaches to evaluate their teams and by players to show their performance both to their current team and to other teams if they get cut29 the quality of preseason games has been criticized

highlighted in green finished in first place in the afc east thus in 2017 the patriots will play two games against each of its division rivals highlighted in light blue one game against each team in the afc west and nfc south highlighted in yellow and one game each against the firstplace finishers in the afc north and afc south highlighted in orange currently the thirteen opponents each team faces over the 16game regular season schedule are set using a predetermined formula69 the national football league runs a seventeenweek 256game regular season since 2001 the season has begun the week after labor day first monday in september and concluded the week after christmas70 the opening game of the season is normally a primetime home game for the leagues defending champion71 most nfl games are played on sundays with a monday night game typically held at least once a week and thursday night games occurring on most weeks as well71 nfl games are not normally played on fridays or saturdays until late in the regular season as federal law prohibits professional football leagues from competing with college or high school football because high school and college teams typically play games on friday and saturday respectively the nfl cannot hold games on those days until the third friday in december72 nfl games are rarely scheduled for tuesday or wednesday and those days have only been used twice since 1948 in 2010 when a sunday game was rescheduled to tuesday due to a blizzard and in 2012 when the kickoff game was moved from thursday to wednesday to avoid conflict with the democratic national convention7374 nfl regular season matchups are determined according to a scheduling formula within a division all four teams play fourteen out of their sixteen games against common opponents – two games home and away are played against the other three teams in the division while one game is held against all the members of a division from the nfc and a division from the afc as determined by a rotating cycle three years for the conference the team is in and four years in the conference they are not in the other two games are intraconference games determined by the standings of the previous year – for example if a team finishes first in its division it will play two other firstplace teams in its conference while a team that finishes last would play two other lastplace teams in the conference75 in total each team plays sixteen games and has one bye week where they do not play any games76 although the teams any given club will play are known by the end of the previous years regular season the exact dates times and homeaway status for nfl games are not determined until much later because the league has to account for among other things the major league baseball postseason and local events that could pose a scheduling conflict with nfl games during the 2010 season over 500000 potential schedules were created by computers 5000 of which were considered playable schedules and were reviewed by the nfls scheduling team after arriving at what they felt was the best schedule out of the group nearly 50 more potential schedules were developed to try and ensure that the chosen schedule would be the best possible one77 postseason main articles nfl playoffs pro bowl and super bowl the seeding bracket for the nfl playoffs following the conclusion of the regular season a twelveteam single elimination tournament the nfl playoffs is held six teams are selected from each conference the winners of each of the four divisions as well as two wild card teams the two remaining teams with the best overall record these teams are seeded according to overall record with the division champions always ranking higher than either of the wild card teams78 the top two teams seeded one and two from each conference are awarded a bye week while the remaining four teams seeded 3–6 from each conference compete in the first round of the playoffs the wild card round with the third seed competing against the sixth seed and the fourth seed competing against the fifth seed the winners of the wild card round advance to the divisional round which matches the lower seeded team against the first seed and the higher seeded team against the second seed the winners of those games then compete in the conference championships with the higher remaining seed hosting the lower remaining seed the afc and nfc champions then compete in the super bowl to determine the league champion the only other postseason event hosted by the nfl is the pro bowl the leagues allstar game since 2009 the pro bowl has been held the week before the super bowl in previous years the game was held the week following the super bowl but in an effort to boost ratings the game was moved to the week before79 because of this players from the teams participating in the super bowl are exempt from participating in the game the pro bowl is not considered as competitive as a regularseason game because the biggest concern of teams is to avoid injuries to the players80 trophies and awards main article list of national football league awards team trophies main articles vince lombardi trophy ed thorp memorial trophy and brunswickbalke collender cup the national football league has used three different trophies to honor its champion over its existence the first trophy the brunswickbalke collender cup was donated to the nfl then apfa in 1920 by the brunswickbalke collender corporation the trophy the appearance of which is only known by its description as a silver loving cup was intended to be a traveling trophy and not to become permanent until a team had won at least three titles the league awarded it to the akron pros champions of the inaugural 1920 season however the trophy was discontinued and its current whereabouts are unknown81 a second trophy the ed thorp memorial trophy was issued by the nfl from 1934 to 1969 the trophys namesake ed thorp was a referee in the league and a friend to many early league owners upon his death in 1934 the league created the trophy to honor him in addition to the main trophy which would be in the possession of the current league champion the league issued a smaller replica trophy to each champion who would maintain permanent control over it the current location of the ed thorp memorial trophy like that of its predecessor is unknown the predominant theory is that the minnesota vikings the last team to be awarded the trophy somehow misplaced it after the 1969 season82 the current trophy of the nfl is the vince lombardi trophy the super bowl trophy was officially renamed in 1970 after vince lombardi who as head coach led the green bay packers to victories in the first two super bowls unlike the previous trophies a new vince lombardi trophy is issued to each years champion who maintains permanent control of it lombardi trophies are made by tiffany co out of sterling silver and are worth anywhere from us25000 to us30000083 additionally each player on the winning team as well as coaches and personnel are awarded super bowl rings to commemorate their victory the winning team chooses the company that makes the rings each ring design varies with the nfl mandating certain ring specifications which have a degree of room for deviation in addition to requiring the super bowl logo be on at least one side of the ring84 the losing team are also awarded rings which must be no more than half as valuable as the winners rings but those are almost never worn85 the conference champions receive trophies for their achievement the champions of the nfc receive the george halas trophy86 named after chicago bears founder george halas who is also considered as one of the cofounders of the nfl the afc champions receive the lamar hunt trophy87 named after lamar hunt the founder of the kansas city chiefs and the principal founder of the american football league players on the winning team also receive a conference championship ring8889 player and coach awards see also categorynational football league trophies and awards the nfl recognizes a number of awards for its players and coaches at

respective englishlanguage sister networks games101102 the leagues contracts do not cover preseason games which individual teams are free to sell to local stations directly a minority of preseason games are distributed among the leagues national television partners through the 2014 season the nfl had a blackout policy in which games were blacked out on local television in the home teams area if the home stadium was not sold out clubs could elect to set this requirement at only 85 but they would have to give more ticket revenue to the visiting team teams could also request a specific exemption from the nfl for the game the vast majority of nfl games were not blacked out only 6 of games were blacked out during the 2011 season103 and only two games were blacked out in 2013 and none in 2014104 the nfl announced in march 2015 that it would suspend its blackout policy for at least the 2015 season104 according to nielsen the nfl regular season since 2012 was watched by at least 200 million individuals accounting for 80 of all television households in the united states and 69 of all potential viewers in the united states nfl regular season games accounted for 31 out of the top 32 mostwatched programs in the fall season and an nfl game ranked as the mostwatched television show in all 17 weeks of the regular season at the local level nfl games were the highestranked shows in nfl markets 92 of the time105 super bowls account for the 22 mostwatched programs based on total audience in us history including a record 167 million people that watched super bowl xlviii the conclusion to the 2013 season106 in addition to radio networks run by each nfl team select nfl games are broadcast nationally by westwood one known as dial global for the 2012 season these games are broadcast on over 500 networks giving all nfl markets access to each primetime game the nfls deal with westwood one was extended in 2012 and will run through 2017107 some broadcasting innovations have either been introduced or popularized during nfl telecasts among them the skycam camera system was used for the first time in a live telecast at a 1984 preseason nfl game in san diego between the chargers and 49ers and televised by cbs108 commentator john madden famously used a telestrator during games between the early 1980s to the mid2000s boosting the devices popularity109 the nfl as a onetime experiment distributed the october 25 2015 international series game from wembley stadium in london between the buffalo bills and jacksonville jaguars the game was live streamed on the internet exclusively via yahoo except for overtheair broadcasts on the local cbstv affiliates in the buffalo and jacksonville markets110111112 in 2015 the nfl began sponsoring a series of public service announcements to bring attention to domestic abuse and sexual assault in response to what was seen as poor handling of incidents of violence by players113 draft main article national football league draft each april excluding 2014 when it took place in may the nfl holds a draft of college players the draft consists of seven rounds with each of the 32 clubs getting one pick in each round114 the draft order for nonplayoff teams is determined by regularseason record among playoff teams teams are first ranked by the furthest round of the playoffs they reached and then are ranked by regularseason record for example any team that reached the divisional round will be given a higher pick than any team that reached the conference championships but will be given a lower pick than any team that did not make the divisional round the super bowl champion always drafts last and the losing team from the super bowl always drafts nexttolast115 all potential draftees must be at least three years removed from high school in order to be eligible for the draft116 underclassmen that have met that criterion to be eligible for the draft must write an application to the nfl by january 15 renouncing their remaining college eligibility117 clubs can trade away picks for future draft picks but cannot trade the rights to players they have selected in previous drafts118 rams quarterback jared goff the first overall draft pick in the 2016 nfl draft aside from the 32 picks each club gets compensatory draft picks are given to teams that have lost more compensatory free agents than they have gained these are spread out from rounds 3 to 7 and a total of 32 are given119 clubs are required to make their selection within a certain period of time the exact time depending on which round the pick is made in if they fail to do so on time the clubs behind them can begin to select their players in order but they do not lose the pick outright this happened in the 2003 draft when the minnesota vikings failed to make their selection on time the jacksonville jaguars and carolina panthers were able to make their picks before the vikings were able to use theirs120 selected players are only allowed to negotiate contracts with the team that picked them but if they choose not to sign they become eligible for the next years draft121 under the current collective bargaining contract all contracts to drafted players must be fouryear deals with a club option for a fifth contracts themselves are limited to a certain amount of money depending on the exact draft pick the player was selected with122 players who were draft eligible but not picked in the draft are free to sign with any club114 the nfl operates several other drafts in addition to the nfl draft the league holds a supplemental draft annually clubs submit emails to the league stating the player they wish to select and the round they will do so and the team with the highest bid wins the rights to that player the exact order is determined by a lottery held before the draft and a successful bid for a player will result in the team forfeiting the rights to its pick in the equivalent round of the next nfl draft123 players are only eligible for the supplemental draft after being granted a petition for special eligibility124 the league holds expansion drafts the most recent happening in 2002 when the houston texans began play as an expansion team125 other drafts held by the league include an allocation draft in 1950 to allocate players from several teams that played in the dissolved allamerica football conference126 and a supplemental draft in 1984 to give nfl teams the rights to players who had been eligible for the main draft but had not been drafted because they had signed contracts with the united states football league or canadian football league127 like the other major sports leagues in the united states the nfl maintains protocol for a disaster draft in the event of a near disaster less than 15 players killed or disabled that caused the club to lose a quarterback they could draft one from a team with at least three quarterbacks in the event of a disaster 15 or more players killed or disabled that results in a clubs season being cancelled a restocking draft would be held neither of these protocols has ever had to be implemented128 free agency free agents in the national football league are divided into restricted free agents who have three accrued seasons and whose current contract has expired and unrestricted free agents who have four or more accrued seasons and whose contract has expired an accrued season is defined as six or more regularseason games on a clubs activeinactive reservedinjured or reservephysically unable to perform lists129 restricted free agents are allowed to negotiate with other clubs besides their former club but the former club has the right to match any offer if they choose not to they are compensated with draft picks unrestricted free agents are free to sign with any club and no compensation is owed if they sign with a different club129 clubs are given one franchise tag to offer to any unrestricted free agent the franchise tag is a oneyear deal that pays the player 120 of his previous contract or no less than the average of the five highestpaid players at his position whichever is greater there are two types of franchise tags exclusive tags which do not allow the player to negotiate with other clubs and nonexclusive tags which allow the player to negotiate with other clubs but gives his former club the right to match any offer and two firstround draft picks if they decline to match it130 clubs also have the option to use a transition tag which is similar to the nonexclusive franchise tag but offers no compensation if the former club refuses to match the offer131 due to that stipulation the transition tag is rarely used132 even with the removal of the poison pill strategy offering a contract with stipulations that the former club would be unable to match that essentially ended the usage of the tag leaguewide133 each club is subject to a salary cap which is set at us14328 million for the 2015 season us10 million more than in 2014 and us20 million more than in 2013134 the salary cap for the 2016 nfl season was 15527 million135the salary cap for the 2017 nfl season will be 167 million136 members of clubs practice squads despite being paid by and working for their respective clubs are also simultaneously a kind of free agent and are able to sign to any other clubs active roster provided their new club is not their previous clubs next opponent within a set number of days without compensation to their previous club practice squad players cannot be signed to other clubs practice squads however unless released by their original club first137 see also american football portal national football league portal united states portal national football league 1902 list of
