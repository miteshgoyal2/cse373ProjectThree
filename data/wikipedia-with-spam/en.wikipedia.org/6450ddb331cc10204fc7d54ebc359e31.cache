conservative in his religion to the point of opposing a divorce law and a lifelong teetotaler2 indeed he was teetotal to the point where he had the customers of his store buy their liquor direct from visiting ship captains so that he would not be involved in the transactions11 he was a political conservative and a cautious and conservative businessman and investor2 denny in his memoir described his decision to head north from portland to puget sound as a desperate venture lorraine mcconaghy historian at seattles museum of history and industry agrees but characterizes it further as the only one he ever undertook9 womens suffrageedit denny supported the right of women to vote going so far as to introduce legislation in 1854 to allow white women of 18 years and older the right to vote12 the resolution was voted down12 argument over landedit arthur a denny home this dour man is nonetheless remembered for at least one example of his wit also in his memoir recounting his failure in 1853 to reach agreement with david swinson doc maynard over what was intended to be a joint plat of the town of seattle he wrote it was found that the doctor who occasionally stimulated a little had that day taken enough to cause him to feel that he was not only monarch of all he surveyed but what boren and i had surveyed as well13 it was later shown in a review done by a professional engineering firm on behalf of the city that it was in fact denny that was wrong about the direction the streets should run and had actually violated the law in his plat of the citycitation needed worksedit pioneer
