rival leagues however in 1960 it encountered its most serious competitor when the american football league afl was formed the afl vied heavily with the nfl for both players and fans but by the middle of the decade the strain of competition led to serious merger talks between the two leagues prior to the 1966 season the nfl and afl reached a merger agreement that was to take effect for the 1970 season as part of the merger the champions of the two leagues agreed to meet in a world championship game for professional american football until the merger was effected a bowl game is a postseason college football game the original bowl game was the rose bowl game in pasadena california which was first played in 1902 as the tournament eastwest football game as part of the pasadena tournament of roses and moved to the new rose bowl stadium in 1923 the stadium got its name from the fact that the game played there was part of the tournament of roses and that it was shaped like a bowl much like the yale bowl in new haven connecticut the tournament of roses football game itself eventually came to be known as the rose bowl game exploiting the rose bowl games popularity postseason college football contests were created for miami the orange bowl new orleans the sugar bowl and el paso texas the sun bowl in 1935 and for dallas the cotton bowl in 1937 by the time the first super bowl was played the term bowl for any major american football game was well established the packers defeated the chiefs in the first afl–nfl championship game super bowl i lamar hunt owner of the afls kansas city chiefs first used the term super bowl10 to refer to the nflafl championship game in the merger meetings hunt later said the name was likely in his head because his children had been playing with a super ball toy11 a vintage example of the ball is on display at the pro football hall of fame in canton ohio in a july 25 1966 letter to nfl commissioner pete rozelle hunt wrote i have kiddingly called it the super bowl which obviously can be improved upon the leagues owners chose the name afl–nfl championship game12 but in july 1966 the kansas city star quoted hunt in discussing the super bowl — thats my term for the championship game between the two leagues13 and the media immediately began using the term14 although the league stated in 1967 that not many people like it asking for suggestions and considering alternatives such as merger bowl and the game the associated press reported that super bowl grew and grew and grewuntil it reached the point that there was super week super sunday super teams super players ad infinitum12 super bowl became official beginning with the third annual game15 roman numerals were first affixed for the fifth edition in january 197116 the jets were the first afl team to win a super bowl super bowl iii defeating the colts after the nfls green bay packers won the first two super bowls some team owners feared for the future of the merger at the time many doubted the competitiveness of afl teams compared with their nfl counterparts though that perception changed when the afls new york jets defeated the nfls baltimore colts in super bowl iii in miami one year later the afls kansas city chiefs defeated the nfls minnesota vikings 23–7 in super bowl iv in new orleans which was the final aflnfl world championship game played before the

following lombardis death in september 1970 the trophy was named the vince lombardi trophy the first trophy awarded under the new name was presented to the baltimore colts following their win in super bowl v in miami dateedit the super bowl is currently played on the first sunday in february this is due to the nfl current schedule which consists of the opening weekend of the season being held immediately after labor day the first monday in september the 17week regular season where teams each play 16 games and have one bye the first three rounds of the playoffs and the super bowl two weeks after the two conference championship games this schedule has been in effect since super bowl xxxviii in february 2004 the date of the super bowl can thus be determined from the date of the preceding labor day for example labor day in 2015 occurred on september 7 therefore the next super bowl was scheduled exactly five months later on february 7 2016 originally the game took place in early to midjanuary for super bowl i there was only one round of playoffs the premerger nfl and afl championship games the addition of two playoff rounds first in 1967 and then in 1978 an increase in regular season games from 14 to 16 1978 and the establishment of one byeweek per team 1990 have caused the super bowl to be played later partially offsetting these seasonlengthening effects simultaneous with the addition of two regular season games in 1978 the season was started earlier prior to 1978 the season started as late as september 21 now since labor day is always the first monday of september september 13 is the latest possible date for the first full sunday set of games since 2002 the regular season has started with the kickoff game on the thursday after labor day game historyedit for a

miami area ten times and the greater los angeles area seven times no market or region without an nfl franchise has ever hosted a super bowl and the presence of an nfl team in a market or region is now a de jure requirement for bidding on the game4142 the winning market is not however required to host the super bowl in the same stadium that its nfl team uses and nine super bowls have been held in a stadium other than the one the nfl team in that city was using at the time los angeless last five super bowls were all played at the rose bowl no team has ever played the super bowl in its home stadium two teams have played the super bowl in their home market the san francisco 49ers who played super bowl xix in stanford stadium instead of candlestick park and the los angeles rams who played super bowl xiv in the rose bowl instead of the los angeles memorial coliseum in both cases the stadium in which the super bowl was held was perceived to be a better stadium for a large highprofile event than the stadiums the rams and 49ers were playing in at the time this situation has not arisen since 1993 in part because the league has traditionally awarded the super bowl in modern times to the newest stadiums besides those two the only other super bowl venue that was not the home stadium to an nfl team at the time was rice stadium in houston the houston oilers had played there previously but moved to the astrodome several years prior to super bowl viii the orange bowl was the only afl stadium to host a super bowl and the only stadium to host consecutive super bowls hosting super bowls ii and iii traditionally the nfl does not award super bowls to stadiums that are located in climates with an expected average daily temperature less than 50 °f 10 °c on game day unless the field can be completely covered by a fixed or retractable roof43 five super bowls have been played in northern cities two in the detroit area—super bowl xvi at pontiac silverdome in pontiac michigan and super bowl xl at ford field in detroit one in minneapolis—super bowl xxvi one in indianapolis at lucas oil stadium for super bowl xlvi and one in the new york area—super bowl xlviii at metlife stadium only metlife stadium did not have a roof be it fixed or retractable but it was still picked as the host stadium for super bowl xlviii in an apparent waiver of the warmclimate rule a sixth super bowl is planned in a northern city as minneapolis has been picked to host super bowl lii in 2018 in the roofed us bank stadium44 there have been a few instances where the league has rescinded the super bowl from cities super bowl xxvii in 1993 was originally awarded to sun devil stadium in tempe arizona but after arizona voters elected not to recognize martin luther king jr day as a paid stateemployees holiday in 1990 the nfl moved the game to the rose bowl in pasadena california45 when voters in arizona opted to create such a legal holiday in 1992 super bowl xxx in 1996 was awarded to tempe super bowl xxxiii was awarded first to candlestick park in san francisco but when plans to renovate the stadium fell through the game was moved to pro player stadium in greater miami super bowl xxxvii was awarded to a new stadium not yet built in san francisco when that stadium failed to be built the game was moved to san diego super bowl xliv slated for february 7 2010 was withdrawn from new york citys proposed west side stadium because the city state and proposed tenants new york jets could not agree on funding super bowl xliv was then eventually awarded to sun life stadium in miami gardens florida super bowl xlix in 2015 was originally given to arrowhead stadium in kansas city missouri but after two sales taxes failed to pass at the ballot box and opposition by local business leaders and politicians increased kansas city eventually withdrew its request to host the game46 super bowl xlix was then eventually awarded to university of phoenix stadium in glendale arizona in 2011 texas attorney general greg abbott said its commonly known as the single largest human trafficking incident in the united states according to forbes 10000 prostitutes were brought to miami in 2010 for the super bowl47 snopes research in 2015 determined that the actual number of prostitutes involved in a typical super bowl weekend is less than 100 not statistically higher than any other time of the year and that the notion of mass increases in human trafficking around the super bowl was a politicians myth48 selection processedit the location of the super bowl is chosen by the nfl well in advance usually three to five years before the game cities place bids to host a super bowl and are evaluated in terms of stadium renovation and their ability to host4349 in 2014 a document listing the specific requirements of super bowl hosts was leaked giving a clear list of what was required for a super bowl host50 much of the cost of the super bowl is to be assumed by the host community although some costs are enumerated within the requirements to be assumed by the nfl some of the host requirements include the host stadium must be in a market that hosts an nfl team and must have a minimum of 70000 seats with the media and electrical amenities necessary to produce the super bowl stadiums may include temporary seating for super bowls but seating must be approved by the league stadiums where the average game day temperature is below 50° fahrenheit must either have a roof or a waiver given by the league there must be a minimum of 35000 parking spaces within one mile of the stadium the host stadium must have space for the gameday experience a large pregame entertainment area within walking distance of the stadium the host city must have space for the nfl experience the interactive football theme park which is operated the week prior to the super bowl an indoor venue for the event must have a minimum of 850000 square feet and an outdoor venue must have a minimum of 1000000 square feet additionally there must be space nearby for the media center and space for all other events involved in the super bowl week including golf courses and bowling alleys the necessary infrastructure must be in place around the stadium and other super bowl facilities including parking security electrical needs media needs communication needs and transportation needs there must be a minimum number of hotel spaces within one hours drive of the stadium equaling 35 of the stadiums capacity along with hotels for the teams officials media and other dignitaries for super bowl xxxix the city of jacksonville docked several luxury cruise liners at their port to act as temporary hotel space51 there must be practice space of equal and comparable quality for both teams within a 20minute drive of the team hotels and rehearsal space for all events within a reasonable distance to the stadium the practice facilities must have one grass field and at least one field of the same surface as the host stadium the stadium must have a minimum of 70000 fixed seats including club and fixed suite seating during regular season operations the nfl owners meet to make a selection on the site usually three to five years prior to the event in 2007 nfl commissioner roger goodell suggested that a super bowl might be played in london perhaps at wembley stadium52 the game has never been played in a region that lacks an nfl franchise seven super bowls have been played in los angeles but none were held there in the 21year period when the league had no team in the area new orleans the site of the 2013 super bowl invested more than 1 billion in infrastructure improvements in the years leading up to the game53 home team designationedit the designated home team alternates between the nfc team in oddnumbered games and the afc team in evennumbered games5455 this alternation was initiated with the first super bowl when the green bay packers were the designated home team regardless of being the home or away team of record each team has their team wordmark painted in one of the end zones designated away teams have won 30 of 51 super bowls to date approximately 59 percent the redskins are one of five home teams that choose to wear their white jersey in super bowl xvii since super bowl xiii in january 1979 the home team is given the choice of wearing their colored or white jerseys originally the designated home team had to wear their colored jerseys which resulted in dallas donning their less exposed dark blue jerseys for super bowl v while most of the home teams in the super bowl have chosen to wear their colored jerseys there have been five exceptions the cowboys during super bowl xiii and xxvii the washington redskins during super bowl xvii the pittsburgh steelers during super bowl xl and the denver broncos in super bowl 50 the cowboys since 1964 worn white jerseys at home the redskins wore white at home under coach joe gibbs starting in 1981 through 1992 continued by richie petitbon and norv turner through 2000 then again when gibbs returned from 2004 through 2007 meanwhile the steelers who have always worn their black jerseys at home since the aflnfl merger in 1970 opted for the white jerseys after winning three consecutive playoff games on the road wearing white the steelers decision was compared with the new england patriots in super bowl xx the patriots had worn white jerseys at home during the 1985 season but after winning road playoff games against the new york jets and miami dolphins wearing red jerseys new england opted to switch to red for the super bowl as the designated home team for the broncos in super bowl 50 denver general manager john elway simply stated weve had super bowl success in our white uniforms they previously had been 0–4 in super bowls when wearing their orange jerseys5657 the broncos decision is also perceived to be made out of superstition losing all super bowl games with the orange jerseys in terrible fashion whiteshirted teams have won 32 of 50 super bowls to date 64 percent including 11 of the last 12 super bowls the 49ers as part of the leagues 75th

game has never been played in a region that lacked an nfl franchise london england has occasionally been mentioned as a host city for a super bowl in the near future61 wembley stadium has hosted several nfl games as part of the nfl international series and is specifically designed for large individual events nfl commissioner roger goodell has openly discussed the possibility on different occasions62636465 time zone complications are a significant obstacle to a super bowl in london a typical 630 pm eastern time start would result in the game beginning at 1130 pm local time in london an unusually late hour to be holding spectator sports the nfl has never in its history started a game later than 915 pm local time65 as bids have been submitted for all super bowls through super bowl lvi the soonest that any stadium outside the nfls footprint could serve as host would be super bowl lvii in 2023 super bowl trademarkedit the nfl is very active on stopping what it says is unauthorized commercial use of its trademarked terms nfl super bowl and super sunday66 as a result many events and promotions tied to the game but not sanctioned by the nfl are asked to refer to it with colloquialisms such as the big game or other generic descriptions67 a radio spot for planters nuts parodied this by saying it would be superto have a bowlof planters nuts while watching the big game and comedian stephen colbert began referring to the game in 2014 as the superb owl in 2015 the nfl filed opposition with the uspto trademark trial and appeal board to a trademark application submitted by an arizonabased nonprofit for superb owl68 the nfl claims that the use of the phrase super bowl implies an nfl affiliation and on this basis the league asserts broad rights to restrict how the game may be shown publicly for example the league says super bowl showings are prohibited in churches or at other events that promote a message while venues that do not regularly show sporting events cannot show the super bowl on any television screen larger than 55 inches69 some critics say the nfl is exaggerating its ownership rights by stating that any use is prohibited as this contradicts the broad doctrine of fair use in the united states69 legislation was proposed by utah senator orrin hatch in 2008 to provide an exemption from exclusive rights in copyright for certain nonprofit organizations to display live football games and for other purposes70 in 2004 the nfl started issuing cease and desist letters to casinos in las vegas that were hosting superbowl parties superbowl is a registered trademark owned by the nfl and any other business using that name for profitmaking ventures is in violation of federal law according to the letters in reaction to the letters many vegas resorts rather than discontinue the popular and lucrative parties started referring to them as big game parties717273 in 2006 the nfl made an attempt to trademark the big game as well however it withdrew the application in 2007 due to growing commercial and publicrelations opposition to the move mostly from stanford university and the university of california berkeley and their fans as the stanford cardinal football and california golden bears football teams compete in the big game which has been played since 1892 28 years before the formation of the nfl and 75 years before super bowl

nonamericans7677 others feel the title is fitting since it is the only professional league of its kind78 the practice by the us major leagues of using the world champion moniker originates from the
