librarian of congress was paid two dollars per day and was required to also serve as the clerk of the house of representatives6 the small congressional library was housed in the united states capitol for most of the 19th century until the early 1890s most of the original collection had been destroyed by the british in 1814 during the war of 1812 to restore its collection in 1815 the library bought from former president thomas jefferson his entire personal collection of 6487 books after a period of slow growth another fire struck the library in its capitol chambers in 1851 again destroying a large amount of the collection including many of jeffersons books after the american civil war the library of congress grew rapidly in both size and importance which sparked a campaign to purchase replacement copies for volumes that had been burned from other sources collections and libraries which had started to appear throughout the burgeoning united states the library received the right of transference of all copyrighted works to have two copies deposited of books maps illustrations and diagrams printed in the united states it also began to build its collections of british and other european works and then of works published throughout the englishspeaking world this development culminated in the construction between 1888 and 1894 of a separate extensive library building across the street from the capitol in the beaux arts style with fine decorations murals paintings marble halls columns and steps carved hardwoods and a stained glass dome it included several stories built underground of steel and cast iron stacks the librarys primary mission of researching inquiries made by members of congress is carried out through the congressional research service traces its origin

historyedit construction of the thomas jefferson building from july 8 1888 to may 15 1894 1800–51 origins and jeffersons contributionedit james madison is credited with the idea for creating a congressional library first making such a proposition in 17837 the library of congress was established april 24 1800 when president john adams signed an act of congress providing for the transfer of the seat of government from philadelphia to the new capital city of washington part of the legislation appropriated 5000 for the purchase of such books as may be necessary for the use of congress and for fitting up a suitable apartment for containing them8 books were ordered from london and the collection consisting of 740 books and 3 maps was housed in the new capitol9 as president thomas jefferson played an important role in establishing the structure of the library of congress on january 26 1802 he signed a bill that allowed the president to appoint an overseer of the library of congress the librarian of congress and for the establishment of a joint committee on the library to regulate and oversee the library the new law also extended to the president and vice president the ability to borrow books1011 in the midst of the war of 1812 invading british regulars led a burning of washington in august 1814 including the capitol and destroyed the library of congress and its collection of 3000 volumes9 these volumes had been left in the senate wing of the capitol11 one of the few congressional volumes to survive was a government account book of receipts and expenditures for the year 181012 it was taken as a souvenir by the british commander admiral george cockburn whose family later returned it to the united states government in 194013 within a month former president jefferson offered to sell his personal library1415 as a replacement in january 1815 congress accepted jeffersons offer appropriating 23950 to purchase his 6487 books9 some members of the house of representatives opposed the outright purchase including daniel webster a new hampshire representative who wanted to return all books of an atheistical irreligious and immoral tendency16 jefferson had spent 50 years accumulating a wide variety of books in several languages and in many subjects including philosophy science literature architecture law religion and mathematics he had also collected books on topics not normally viewed as part of a legislative library such as cookbooks however he believed all subjects had a place in the library of congress he remarked i do not know that it contains any branch of science which congress would wish to exclude from their collection there is in fact no subject to which a member of congress may not have occasion to refer16 jeffersons collection was unique in that it was a working collection of a scholar not a gentlemans collection for display jeffersons original collection was organized into a scheme based on francis bacons organization of knowledge specifically he grouped his books into memory reason and imagination which broke down into 44 more subdivisions the library followed jeffersons organization scheme until the late 19th century when librarian herbert putnam began work on a more flexible library of congress classification structure that now applies to more than 138 million items in 1851 a fire destroyed two thirds of the jefferson collection with only 2000 books remaining in 2008 after working for ten years the librarians at the library of congress had found replacements for all but 300 of the works that were in jeffersons original collection17 1851–65 weakeningedit the antebellum period was difficult for the library during the 1850s the smithsonian institutions librarian charles coffin jewett aggressively tried to move that organization towards becoming the united states national library his efforts were blocked by the smithsonian secretary joseph henry who advocated a focus on scientific research and publication and favored the library of congress development into the national library henrys dismissal of jewett in july 1854 ended the smithsonians attempts to become the national library and in 1866 henry transferred the smithsonian institutions library of forty thousand volumes to the library of congress9 december 24 1851 the largest fire in the librarys history destroyed 35000 books about two–thirds of the librarys 55000 book collection including twothirds of jeffersons original transfer congress in 1852 quickly appropriated 168700 to replace the lost books but not for the acquisition of new materials this marked the start of a conservative period in the librarys administration by librarian john silva meehan and joint committee chairman james a pearce who worked to restrict the librarys activities in 1857 congress transferred the librarys public document distribution activities to the department of the interior and its international book exchange program to the department of state abraham lincolns political appointment of john g stephenson as librarian of congress in 1861 further weakened the library stephensons focus was on nonlibrary affairs including service as a volunteer aidedecamp at the battles of chancellorsville and gettysburg during the american civil war by the conclusion of the war the library of congress had a staff of seven for a collection of 80000 volumes9 the centralization of copyright offices into the united states patent office in 1859 ended the librarys thirteenyear role as a depository of all copyrighted books and pamphlets 1865–97 spoffords expansionedit the west façade of the library of congress in 1898 the library of congress inside the us capitol building c 1890 the library of congress reasserted itself during the latter half of the 19th century under librarian ainsworth rand spofford who directed the library from 1865 to 1897 aided by an overall expansion of the federal government and a favorable political climate spofford built broad bipartisan support for the library as a national library and a legislative resource began comprehensively collecting americana and american literature and led the construction of a new building to house the library and transformed the librarian of congress position into one of strength and independence between 1865 and 1870 congress appropriated funds for the construction of the thomas jefferson building placed all copyright registration and deposit activities under the librarys control and restored the librarys international book exchange the library also acquired the vast libraries of both the smithsonian and historian peter force strengthening its scientific and americana collections significantly by 1876 the library of congress had 300000 volumes and was tied with the boston public library as the nations largest library when the library moved from the capitol building to its new headquarters in 1897 it had over 840000 volumes 40 of which had been acquired through copyright deposit9 some of the library of congress holdings awaiting shelving inside the newly opened thomas jefferson building in 1897 a year before the librarys move to its new location the joint library committee held a session of hearings to assess the condition of the library and plan for its future growth and possible reorganization spofford and six experts sent by the american library association including future librarian of congress herbert putnam and melvil dewey of the new york state library testified before the committee that the library should continue its expansion towards becoming a true national library based on the hearings and with the assistance of senators justin morrill of vermont and daniel voorhees of indiana congress more than doubled the librarys staff from 42 to 108 and established new administrative units for all aspects of the librarys collection congress also strengthened the office of librarian of congress to govern the library and make staff appointments as well as requiring senate approval for presidential appointees to the position9 1897–1939 postreorganizationedit the library of congress in 1898 the library of congress spurred by the 1897 reorganization began to grow and develop more rapidly spoffords successor john russell young though only in office for two years overhauled the librarys bureaucracy used his connections as a former diplomat to acquire more materials from around the world and established the librarys first assistance programs for the blind and physically disabled youngs successor herbert putnam held the office for forty years from 1899 to 1939 entering into the position two years before the library became the first in the united states to hold one million volumes9 putnam focused his efforts on making the library more accessible and useful for the public and for other libraries he instituted the interlibrary loan service transforming the library of congress into what he referred to as a library of last resort18 putnam also expanded library access to scientific investigators and duly qualified individuals and began publishing primary sources for the benefit of scholars9 putnams tenure also saw increasing diversity in the librarys acquisitions in 1903 he persuaded president theodore roosevelt to transfer by executive order the papers of the founding fathers from the state department to the library of congress putnam expanded foreign acquisitions as well including the 1904 purchase of a fourthousand volume library of indica the 1906 purchase of g v yudins eightythousand volume russian library the 1908 schatz collection of early opera librettos and the early 1930s purchase of the russian imperial collection consisting of 2600 volumes from the library of the romanov family on a variety of topics collections of hebraica and chinese and japanese works were also acquired congress even took the initiative to acquire materials for the library in one occasion when in 1929 congressman ross collins of mississippi successfully proposed the 15 million purchase of otto vollbehrs collection of incunabula including one of three remaining perfect vellum copies of the gutenberg bible199 a copy of the gutenberg bible on display at the library of congress in 1914 putnam established the legislative reference service as a separative administrative unit of the library based in the progressive eras philosophy of science as a problemsolver and modeled after successful research branches of state legislatures the lrs would provide informed answers to congressional research inquiries on almost any topic in 1965 congress passed an act allowing the library of congress to establish a trust fund board to accept donations and endowments giving the library a role as a patron of the arts the library received the donations and endowments of prominent individuals such as john d rockefeller james b wilbur and archer m huntington gertrude clarke whittall donated five stradivarius violins to the library and elizabeth sprague coolidges donations paid for a concert hall within the library of congress building and the establishment of an honorarium for the music division a number of chairs and consultantships were established from the donations the most wellknown of which is the poet laureate consultant9 the librarys expansion eventually filled the librarys main building despite shelving expansions in 1910 and 1927 forcing the library to expand into a new structure congress acquired nearby land in 1928 and approved construction of the annex building later the john adams building in 1930 although delayed during the depression years it was completed in 1938 and opened to the public in 19399 1939–present modern historyedit erotica mural painting by george randolph barse 1861–1938 in the library of congress elihu vedders minerva of peace mosaic when putnam retired in 1939 president franklin d roosevelt appointed archibald macleish as his successor occupying the post from 1939 to 1944 during the height of world war ii macleish became the most visible librarian of congress in the librarys history macleish encouraged librarians to oppose totalitarianism on behalf of democracy dedicated the south reading room of the adams building to thomas jefferson commissioning artist ezra winter to paint four themed murals for the room and established a democracy alcove in the main reading room of the jefferson building for important documents such as the declaration constitution and the federalist papers the library of congress even assisted during the war effort ranging from the storage of the declaration of independence and the united states constitution in fort knox for safekeeping to researching weather data on the himalayas for air force pilots macleish resigned in 1944 to become assistant secretary of state and president harry truman appointed luther h evans as librarian of congress evans who served until 1953 expanded the librarys acquisitions cataloging and bibliographic services as much as the fiscalminded congress would allow but his primary achievement was the creation of library of congress missions around the world missions played a variety of roles in the postwar world the mission in san francisco assisted participants in the meeting that established the united nations the mission in europe acquired european publications for the library of congress and other american libraries and the mission in japan aided in the creation of the national diet library9 evans successor l quincy mumford took over in 1953 mumfords tenure lasting until 1974 saw the initiation of the construction of the james madison memorial building the third library of congress building mumford directed the library during a period of increased educational spending the windfall of which allowed the library to devote energies towards establishing new acquisition centers abroad including in cairo and new delhi in 1967 the library began experimenting with book preservation techniques through a preservation office which grew to become the largest library research and conservation effort in the united states mumfords administration also saw the last major public debate about the library of congress role as both a legislative library and a national library a 1962 memorandum by douglas bryant of the harvard university library compiled at the request of joint library committee chairman claiborne pell proposed a number of institutional reforms including expansion of national activities and services and various organizational changes all of which would shift the library more towards its national role over its legislative role bryant even suggested possibly changing the name of the library of congress which was rebuked by mumford as unspeakable violence to tradition debate continued within the library community until the legislative reorganization act of 1970 shifted the library back towards its legislative roles placing greater focus on research for congress and congressional committees and renaming the legislative reference service to the congressional research service9 after mumford retired in 1974 gerald ford appointed daniel j boorstin as librarian boorstins first challenge was the move to the new madison building which took place between 1980 and 1982 the move released pressures on staff and shelf space allowing boorstin to focus on other areas of library administration such as acquisitions and collections taking advantage of steady budgetary growth from 116 million in 1975 to over 250 million by 1987 boorstin actively participated in enhancing ties with scholars authors publishers cultural leaders and the business community his active and prolific role changed the post of librarian of congress so that by the time he retired in 1987 the new york times called it perhaps the leading intellectual public position in the nation president ronald reagan nominated james h billington as the 13th librarian of congress in 1987 and the us senate unanimously confirmed the appointment20 under billingtons

available on laserdiscs and cds that would be distributed to schools and libraries after realizing that this plan would be too expensive and inefficient and with the rise of the internet the library decided to instead make digitized material available over the internet this project was made official in the national digital library program ndlp created in october 1994 by 1999 the ndlp had succeeded in digitizing over 5 million objects and had a budget of 12 million the library has kept the american memory name for its public domain website which today contains 15 million digital

the library can be consulted directly on its web site librarians all over the world consult these catalogs through the web or through other media better suited to their needs when they need to catalog for their collection a book published in the united states they use the library of congress control number to make sure of the exact identity of the book digital images are also available at snapshots of the past which provides archival prints55 the library has a budget of between 6–8 million each year for digitization meaning that not all works can be digitized it makes determinations about what objects to prioritize based on what is especially important to congress or potentially interesting for the public the 15 million digitized items represent less than 10 of the librarys total 160million item collection the library has chosen not to participate in other digital library projects such as google books and the digital public library of america although it has supported the internet
