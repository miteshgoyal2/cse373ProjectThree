etymology of london the name london may derive from the river thames the etymology of london is uncertain53 it is an ancient name attested already in the first century ce usually in the latinised form londinium53 for example handwritten roman tablets recovered in the city originating from ad 657080 include the word londinio in london54 over the years the name has attracted many mythicising explanations the earliest attested appears in geoffrey of monmouths historia regum britanniae written around 113653 this had it that the name originated from a supposed king lud who had allegedly taken over the city and named it kaerlud55 modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources latin usually londinium old english usually lunden and welsh usually llundein with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages it is agreed that the name came into these languages from british celtic recent work tends to reconstruct the lost celtic form of the name as londonjon or something similar this was adapted into latin as londinium and borrowed into west germanic the ancestorlanguage of english already before english had become widely spoken in britain56 however the etymology and original meaning of the british celtic form is much debated a prominent explanation was richard coatess 1998 argument that the name derived from preceltic old european plowonida meaning river too wide to ford coates suggested that this was a name given to the part of the river thames which flows through london from this the settlement gained the celtic form of its name lowonidonjon57 however most work has accepted a celtic origin for the name and recent studies have favoured an explanation along the lines of a celtic derivative of an protoindoeuropean root lendh sink cause to sink combined with the celtic suffix injo or onjo used to form placenames peter schrijver has specifically suggested on these grounds that the name originally meant place that floods periodically tidally5856 until 1889 the name london officially applied only to the city of london but since then it has also referred to the county of london and now to greater london59 london is sometimes abbreviated as ldon or ldn60 history main articles history of london and timeline of london prehistory two recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the thames in the london area in 1999 the remains of a bronze age bridge were found on the foreshore north of vauxhall bridge61 this bridge either crossed the thames or gave access to a now lost island in the river dendrochronology dated the timbers to ca 1500 bc61 in 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure dated to ca 4500 bc were found on the thames foreshore south of vauxhall bridge62 the function of the mesolithic structure is not known both structures are on the south bank at a natural crossing point where the river effra flows into the river thames62 roman london in 1300 the city was still confined within the roman walls although there is evidence of scattered brythonic settlements in the area the first major settlement was founded by the romans after the invasion of 43 ad63 this lasted only until around 61 when the iceni tribe led by queen boudica stormed it burning it to the ground64 the next heavily planned incarnation of londinium prospered and it superseded colchester as the capital of the roman province of britannia in 100 at its height in the 2nd century roman london had a population of around 6000065 anglosaxon london and viking period with the collapse of roman rule in the early 5th century london ceased to be a capital and the walled city of londinium was effectively abandoned although roman civilisation continued in the st martininthefields area until around 45066 from around 500 an anglosaxon settlement known as lundenwic developed in the same area slightly to the west of the old roman city67 by about 680 it had revived sufficiently to become a major port although there is little evidence of largescale production of goods from the 820s the town declined because of repeated viking invasions there are three recorded viking assaults on london two of these were successful in 851 and 886 although the vikings were defeated during another attack in 99468 the lancastrian siege of london in 1471 is attacked by a yorkist sally the vikings established danelaw over much of the eastern and northern part of england with its boundary roughly stretching from london to chester it was an area of political and geographical control imposed by the viking incursions which was formally agreed by the danish warlord guthrum and the west saxon king alfred the great in 886 the anglosaxon chronicle recorded that alfred refounded london in 886 archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old roman walls london then grew slowly until about 950 after which activity increased dramatically69 by the 11th century london was beyond all comparison the largest town in england westminster abbey rebuilt in the romanesque style by king edward the confessor was one of the grandest churches in europe winchester had previously been the capital of anglosaxon england but from this time on london became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war in the view of frank stenton it had the resources and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political selfconsciousness appropriate to a national capital7071 middle ages westminster abbey as seen in this painting by canaletto 1749 is a world heritage site and one of londons oldest and most important buildings after winning the battle of hastings william duke of normandy was crowned king of england in the newly completed westminster abbey on christmas day 106672 william constructed the tower of london the first of the many norman castles in england to be rebuilt in stone in the southeastern corner of the city to intimidate the native inhabitants73 in 1097 william ii began the building of westminster hall close by the abbey of the same name the hall became the basis of a new palace of westminster7475 in the 12th century the institutions of central government which had hitherto accompanied the royal english court as it moved around the country grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place for most purposes this was westminster although the royal treasury having been moved from winchester came to rest in the tower while the city of westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms its distinct neighbour the city of london remained englands largest city and principal commercial centre and it flourished under its own unique administration the corporation of london in 1100 its population was around 18000 by 1300 it had grown to nearly 10000076 disaster struck in the form of the black death in the mid14th century when london lost nearly a third of its population77 london was the focus of the peasants revolt in 138178 early modern map of london in 1593 there is only one bridge across the thames but parts of southwark on the south bank of the river have been developed during the tudor period the reformation produced a gradual shift to protestantism and much of london passed from church to private ownership79 woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from london to the nearby shores of the low countries where it was considered indispensable80 but the reach of english maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of northwest europe the commercial route to italy and the mediterranean sea normally lay through antwerp and over the alps any ships passing through the strait of gibraltar to or from england were likely to be italian or ragusan upon the reopening of the netherlands to english shipping in january 1565 there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity81 the royal exchange was founded82 mercantilism grew and monopoly trading companies such as the east india company were established with trade expanding to the new world london became the principal north sea port with migrants arriving from england and abroad the population rose from an estimated 50000 in 1530 to about 225000 in 160579 in the 16th century william shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in london at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre by the end of the tudor period in 1603 london was still very compact there was an assassination attempt on james i in westminster in the gunpowder plot on 5 november 160583 vertues 1738 plan of the lines of communication built during the english civil war in the english civil war the majority of londoners supported the parliamentary cause after an initial advance by the royalists in 1642 culminating in the battles of brentford and turnham green london was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the lines of communication the lines were built by up to 20000 people and were completed in under two months84 the fortifications failed their only test when the new model army entered london in 164785 and they were levelled by parliament the same year86 london was plagued by disease in the early 17th century87 culminating in the great plague of 1665–1666 which killed up to 100000 people or a fifth of the population88 the great fire of london destroyed many parts of the city in 1666 the great fire of london broke out in 1666 in pudding lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings89 rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by robert hooke909192 as surveyor of london93 in 1708 christopher wrens masterpiece st pauls cathedral was completed during the georgian era new districts such as mayfair were formed in the west new bridges over the thames encouraged development in south london in the east the port of london expanded downstream londons development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 1700s in 1762 george iii acquired buckingham house and it was enlarged over the next 75 years during the 18th century london was dogged by crime and the bow street runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force94 in total more than 200 offences were punishable by death95 including petty theft96 most children born in the city died before reaching their third birthday97 view to the royal exchange in the city of london in 1886 the coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas with growing literacy and the development of the printing press making news widely available and fleet street became the centre of the british press following the invasion of amsterdam by napoleonic armies many financiers relocated to london especially a large jewish community and the first london international issueclarification needed was arranged in 1817 around the same time the royal navy became the

as greater london is one of nine regions of england and the toplevel subdivision covering most of the citys metropolisnote 5 the small ancient city of london at its core once comprised the whole settlement but as its urban area grew the corporation of london resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs causing london to be defined in a number of ways for different purposes147 forty per cent of greater london is covered by the london post town within which london forms part of postal addresses148149 the london telephone area code 020 covers a larger area similar in size to greater london although some outer districts are excluded and some places just outside are included the greater london boundary has been aligned to the m25 motorway in places150 outward urban expansion is now prevented by the metropolitan green belt151 although the builtup area extends beyond the boundary in places resulting in a separately defined greater london urban area beyond this is the vast london commuter belt152 greater london is split for some purposes into inner london and outer london153 the city is split by the river thames into north and south with an informal central

status as the capital of england and later the united kingdom has never been granted or confirmed officially—by statute or in written formnote 6 its position was formed through constitutional convention making its status as de facto capital a part of the uks unwritten constitution the capital of england was moved to london from winchester as the palace of westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court and thus the political capital of the nation161 more recently greater london has been defined as a region of england and in this context is known as london14 topography london from primrose hill greater london encompasses a total area of 1583 square kilometres 611 sq mi an area which had a population of 7172036 in 2001 and a

square kilometres 3236 sq mi has a population of 13709000 and a population density of 1510 inhabitants per square kilometre 3900sq mi162 modern london stands on the thames its primary geographical feature a navigable river which crosses the city from the southwest to the east the thames valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including parliament hill addington hills and primrose hill historically london grew up at the lowest bridging point on the thames the thames was once a much broader shallower river with extensive marshlands at high tide its shores reached five times their present width163 since the victorian era the thames has been extensively embanked and many of its london tributaries now flow underground the thames is a tidal river and london is vulnerable to flooding164 the threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level by the slow tilting of britain up in the north and down in the south caused by postglacial rebound165 in 1974 a decade of work began on the construction of the thames barrier across the thames at woolwich to deal with this threat while the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070 concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being discussed166 climate main article climate of london average summertime day temperatures range between 20
