change detection and notification from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search change detection and notification cdn refers to automatic detection of changes made to world wide web pages and notification to interested users by email or other means whereas search engines are designed to find web pages cdn systems are designed to monitor changes to web pages before change detection and notification it was necessary for users to manually check for web page changes either by revisiting web sites or periodically searching again efficient and effective change detection and notification is hampered by the fact that most servers do not accurately track content changes through lastmodified or etag headers contents 1 history 2 architectural approaches 21 server based 22 client based 3 considerations 4 references historyedit in 1996 netmind developed the first change detection and notification tool known as mindit which ran for six years this spawned new services such as changedetection 1999 changedetect 2002 and google alerts 2003 historically change polling has been done either by a server which sent email notifications or a desktop program which audibly alerted the user to a change change alerting is also possible directly to mobile devices and through push notifications webhooks and http callbacks for application integration monitoring options vary by service or product and range from monitoring a single web page at a time to entire web sites what is actually monitored also varies by service or product with the possibilities of monitoring text links documents scripts images or screen shots with the notable exception of googles patent filings related to google alerts intellectual property activity by change detection and notification vendors is minimal1 no one vendor has successfully leveraged exclusive rights to change detection and notification technology through patents or other legal meanscitation needed this has resulted in significant functional overlap between products and services architectural approachesedit change detection and notification services can be categorized by the software architecture they use two principal approaches can be distinguished server basededit a server polls content tracks changes and logs data sending alerts in the form of email notifications webhooks rss typically there will also be an associated website which the user can manage their configuration some services also have a mobile device application which connects to a cloud server and provides alerts to the mobile device client basededit a local client application with a graphical user interface polls content tracks changes and logs data considerationsedit some web pages change regularly due to the inclusion of adverts or feeds in the presented page this can trigger falsepositives in the changedetection since users are often only interested in changes to the main content some approaches to mitigate this issue exist create a metric of difference between two versions of a page calculated for example from change in total size changes in html file or changes in the dom tree and ignore changes below some threshold the threshold may be set by the user or estimated automatically by comparing some early versions of the page content extraction for popular sites or sites running popular software content may be actively separated from chaff by selecting a subtree of the dom for example using xpath another typical method is the use of regular expressions to extract only the text the user is interested in referencesedit he created google alerts now hes an almond farmer cnn retrieved 9 september 2016  chakravarthy s hara s c h 2006 automating change detection and notification of web pages invited
