presented 43 oral arguments including nine before the united states supreme court364250 cruzs record of having argued before the supreme court nine times is more than any practicing lawyer in texas or any current member of congress51 cruz has commented on his nine cases in front of the us supreme court we ended up year after year arguing some of the biggest cases in the country there was a degree of serendipity in that but there was also a concerted effort to seek out and lead conservative fights51 in 2003 while cruz was texas solicitor general the texas attorney generals office declined to defend texas sodomy law in lawrence v texas where the us supreme court decided that state laws banning homosexual sex as illegal sodomy were unconstitutional52 in the landmark case of district of

the state of texas against an attempt to reopen the cases of 51 mexican nationals all of whom were convicted of murder in the united states and were on death row36404250 with the support of the george

convictions for delivery of a controlled substance and attempted robbery he was sentenced as a habitual offender under texas law to sixteen and a half years in prison it later came to light that haleys robbery offense occurred three days before his conviction on the controlled substance charge was finalized so the habitual offender statute might not have applied the habitual offender issue was discovered after haley had exhausted his appeals as solicitor general cruz declined to vacate the sentence saying i think justice is being done because he had a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his errors61 the supreme court later remanded the case to lower courts based on haleys ineffective assistance of counsel claim during oral argument cruz conceded that haley had a very strong argument for ineffective assistance of counsel since haleys attorney failed to recognize the sentencing error and that he would not move to have haley reincarcerated during the appeal

transportation subcommittee on aviation operations safety and security subcommittee on science and space chairman committee on rules and administration special committee on aging comments on president obama in a november 2014 senate speech cruz accused the president of being openly desirous to destroy the constitution and this republic121 in the same speech cruz invoked the speeches of the ancient roman senator cicero against catiline to denounce obamas planned executive actions on immigration reform121 classics professor jesse weiner writing in the atlantic said that cruzs analogy was deeply disquieting because in casting obama in the role of catiline cruz unsubtly suggests that the sitting president was not lawfully elected and is the perpetrator of a violent insurrection to overthrow the government in effect he accuses the president of high treason regardless of ones views on immigration reform and the obama administration at large this is dangerous rhetoric121 cruz has repeatedly said that the 2015 international nuclear agreement with iran will make the obama administration the worlds leading financier of radical islamic terrorism122 in response obama called cruzs statements an example of outrageous attacks from republican critics that crossed the line of responsible discourse weve had a sitting senator who also happens to be running for president suggest that im the leading state sponsor of terrorism maybe this is just an effort to push mr trump out of the headlines but its not the kind of leadership that is needed for america right now122 former republican presidential nominee mitt romney also criticized cruz for his remarks writing that although he too was opposed to the iran agreement cruzs statement connecting obama to terrorism was way over the line and hurts the cause123124 after the death of associate justice antonin scalia cruz expressed his view that the winner of the 2016 us presidential election rather than president obama should appoint a new justice125 in june 2016 cruz blamed the obama administration for the 2016 orlando nightclub shooting reasoning that it did not track the perpetrator omar mateen properly while he was on the terrorist watch list126 following the terrorist attack on nice france cruz said in a statement that the country was at risk as a result of the obama administration having a willful blindness in regards to radical islamists127 with the passing of fidel castro in november cruz charged obama with celebrating and lionizing castro in public statements he made addressing the death128 on december 28 after secretary of state john kerry gave a speech defending the uss decision to allow a un resolution to pass which condemned israeli settlements on land meant to be part of a future palestinian state cruz denounced the speech as disgraceful and that history would preserve both obama and kerry as relentless enemies of israel cruz also accused the obama administration of having a radical antiisrael agenda129 comments on president trump in late january after president trump announced neil gorsuch as his supreme court nominee cruz praised gorsuch as brilliant and immensely talented in a

while negotiating the american health care act133 on april 6 shortly after the shayrat missile strike cruz released a statement displaying his interest in having president trump appeal to congress to take military action in syria for the prevention of radical islamic terrorist acquiring weapons stored in syria134 friction with fellow republican members of congress cruz has used harsh rhetoric against fellow republican politicians and his relationships with various republican members of congress have been strained135136 in 2013 cruz referred to republicans who he thought were insufficiently resistant to the proposals of president obama as a surrender caucus135 cruz also called fellow republicans out as squishes on guncontrol issues during a tea party rally135 cruzs role in the united states federal government shutdown of 2013 in particular attracted criticism from a number of republican colleagues136 republican senator john mccain is reported to particularly dislike cruz in a senate floor speech in 2013 mccain denounced cruzs reference to nazis when discussing the affordable care act136 in march 2013 mccain also called cruz and others wacko birds whose beliefs are not reflective of the views of the majority of republicans136 during the 2016 republican presidential primaries john boehner described cruz as lucifer in the flesh137 while during an interview lindsey graham was quoted as saying if you killed ted cruz on the floor of the senate and the trial was in the senate nobody would convict you138 in a heated senate floor speech in july 2015 cruz accused senate republican leader mitch mcconnell of telling a flatout lie over his intentions to reauthorize the exportimport bank of the united states which cruz opposes what we just saw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every republican senator but what he told the press over and over and over again was a simple lie cruz said of senate republican leader mcconnell139 cruzs incendiary outburst was unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the senate according to reuters139140 in the same speech cruz assailed the republican majority in both houses of congresses for what cruz termed an insufficiently conservative record140 cruzs speech and especially his accusation against mcconnell was condemned by various senior republican senators with john mccain saying that the speech was outside the realm of senate behavior and a very wrong thing to do141 orrin hatch expressed a similar opinion i dont condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie and i know the leader didnt lie142 cruz had alleged that mcconnell scheduled a vote on the exim bank as part of a deal to persuade democrats like maria cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill whereas mcconnell denied there was any deal and that denial is what cruz termed a lie hatch says mcconnell did pledge to help cantwell get a vote on the exim bank143 among cruzs few close allies in the senate is mike lee of utah144145 cruz has expressed pride in his reputation for having few allies saying in june 2015 that he has been vilified for fighting the washington cartel146 when boehner announced in september 2015 that he would step down and resign from the house cruz expressed his concern that before resigning boehner may have cut a deal with nancy pelosi to fund the obama administration for the rest of its tenure147 the following month the budget agreement passed in the house by a vote of 266 to 187 with unanimous support from democrats and from boehner lifting the debt ceiling through march 2017 and cruz called the agreement complete and utter surrender148 2016 presidential campaign main article ted cruz presidential
