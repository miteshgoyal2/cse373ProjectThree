is a genre of popular africanamerican music that originated in the 1940s1 the term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban african americans at a time when urbane rocking jazz based music with a heavy insistent beat was becoming more popular2 in the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s the bands usually consisted of piano one or two guitars bass drums saxophone and sometimes background vocalists rb lyrical themes often encapsulate the africanamerican experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy3 the lyrics in this genre of music focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships freedom economics aspirations and sex the term rhythm and blues has undergone a number of shifts in meaning in the early 1950s it was frequently applied to blues records4 starting in the mid1950s after this style of music contributed to the development of rock and roll the term rb became used to refer to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues as well as gospel and soul music in the 1960s several british rock bands such as the rolling stones the who and the animals were referred to and promoted as being rnb bands posters for the whos residency at the marquee club in 1964 contained the slogan maximum rb5 this tangent of rnb is now known as british rhythm and blues by the 1970s the term rhythm and blues changed again and was used as a blanket term for soul and funk in the 1980s a newer style of rb developed becoming known as contemporary rb it combines elements of rhythm and blues soul funk pop hip hop and dance popular rb vocalists at the end of the 20th century included michael jackson prince r kelly stevie wonder6 whitney houston678 and

coining the term rhythm and blues as a musical term in the united states in 194811 the term was used in billboard as early as 19431213 it replaced the term race music which originally came from within the black community but was deemed offensive in the postwar world1415 the term rhythm and blues was used by billboard in its chart listings from june 1949 until august 1969 when its hot rhythm blues singles chart was renamed as best selling soul singles16 before the rhythm and blues name was instated various record companies had already begun replacing the term race music with sepia series17 writer and producer robert palmer defined rhythm blues as a catchall term referring to any music that was made by and for black americans18 he has used the term rb as a synonym for jump blues19 however allmusic separates it from jump blues because of its stronger gospelesque backbeat20 lawrence cohn author of nothing but the blues writes that rhythm and blues was an umbrella term invented for industry convenience according to him the term embraced all black music except classical music and religious music unless a gospel song sold enough to break into the charts14 well into the 21st century the term rb continues in use in some contexts to categorize music made by black musicians as distinct from styles of music made by other musicians in the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s the bands usually consisted of piano one or two guitars bass drums and saxophone arrangements were rehearsed to the point of effortlessness and were sometimes accompanied by background vocalists simple repetitive parts mesh creating momentum and rhythmic interplay producing mellow lilting and often hypnotic textures while calling attention to no individual sound while singers are emotionally engaged with the lyrics often intensely so they remain cool relaxed and in control the bands dressed in suits and even uniforms a practice associated with the modern popular music that rhythm and blues performers aspired to dominate lyrics often seemed fatalistic and the music typically followed predictable patterns of chords and structure21 historyedit precursorsedit louis jordan new york ny ca july 1946 william p gottlieb 04721 the migration of african americans to the urban industrial centers of chicago detroit new york los angeles and elsewhere in the 1920s and 1930s created a new market for jazz blues and related genres of music these genres of music were often performed by fulltime musicians either working alone or in small groups the precursors of rhythm and blues came from jazz and blues which overlapped in the late1920s1930s through the work of musicians such as the harlem hamfats with their 1936 hit oh red as well as lonnie johnson leroy carr cab calloway count basie and tbone walker there was also increasing emphasis on the electric guitar as a lead instrument as well as the piano and saxophone22 late 1940sedit in 1948 rca victor was marketing black music under the name blues and rhythm in that year louis jordan dominated the top five listings of the rb charts with three songs and two of the top five songs were based on the boogiewoogie rhythms that had come to prominence during the 1940s23 jordans band the tympany five formed in 1938 consisted of him on saxophone and vocals along with musicians on trumpet tenor saxophone piano bass and drums2425 lawrence cohn described the music as grittier than his boogieera jazztinged blues14173 robert palmer described it as urbane rocking jazzbased music with a heavy insistent beat2 jordans cool music along with that of big joe turner roy brown billy wright and wynonie harris is now also referred to as jump blues already paul gayten roy brown and others had had hits in the style now referred to as rhythm and blues in 1948 wynonie harris remake of browns 1947 recording good rockin tonight hit the charts in the 2 spot following band leader sonny thompsons long gone at 12627 in 1949 the term rhythm and blues replaced the billboard category harlem hit parade14 also in that year the hucklebuck recorded by band leader and saxophonist paul williams was the number 1 rb tune remaining on top of the charts for nearly the entire year written by musician and arranger andy gibson the song was described as a dirty boogie because it was risque and raunchy28 paul williams and his hucklebuckers concerts were sweaty riotous affairs that got shut down on more than one occasion their lyrics by roy alfred who later cowrote the 1955 hit the rock and roll waltz were mildly sexually suggestive and one teenager from philadelphia said that hucklebuck was a very nasty dance2930 also in 1949 a new version of a 1920s blues song aint nobodys business was a 4 hit for jimmy witherspoon and louis jordan and the tympany five once again made the top 5 with saturday night fish fry31 many of these hit records were issued on new independent record labels such as savoy founded 1942 king founded 1943 imperial founded 1945 specialty founded 1946 chess founded 1947 and atlantic founded 194822 afrocuban rhythmic influenceedit african american music began incorporating afrocuban rhythmic motifs in the 1800s with the popularity of the cuban contradanza known outside of cuba as the habanera32 the habanera rhythm can be thought of as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat the habanera rhythm shown as tresillo lower notes with the backbeat upper note for the more than quartercentury in which the cakewalk ragtime and protojazz were forming and developing the cuban genre habanera exerted a constant presence in african american popular music33 jazz pioneer jelly roll morton considered the tresillohabanera rhythm which he called the spanish tinge to be an essential ingredient of jazz34 there are examples of tresillolike rhythms in some african american folk musics such as the hand clapping and foot stomping patterns in ring shout postcivil war drum and fife music and new orleans second line music35 wynton marsalis considers tresillo to be the new orleans clave although technically the pattern is only half a clave36 tresillo is the most basic duplepulse rhythmic cell in subsaharan african music traditions and its use in african american music is one of the clearest examples of african rhythmic retention in the united states37 the use of tresillo was continuously reinforced by the consecutive waves of cuban music which were adopted into north american popular culture in 1940 bob zurke released rhumboogie a boogie woogie with a tresillo bass line and lyrics proudly declaring the adoption of cuban rhythm harlems got a new rhythm man its burning up the dance floors because its so hot they took a little rhumba rhythm and added boogie woogie and now look what they got rhumboogie its harlems new creation with the cuban syncopation its the killer just plant your both feet on each side let both your hips and shoulder glide then throw your body back and ride theres nothing like rhumbaoogie rhumboogie boogie woogie in harlem or havana you can kiss the old savannah its a killer although originating in the metropolis at the mouth of the mississippi river new orleans blues with its afrocaribbean rhythmic traits is distinct from the sound of the mississippi delta blues38 in the late 1940s new orleans musicians were especially receptive to cuban influences precisely at the time when rb was first forming39 the first use of tresillo in rb occurred in new orleans robert palmer recalls fats domino in 1956 new orleans producerbandleader dave bartholomew first employed this figure as a saxophonesection riff on his own 1949 disc country boy and subsequently helped make it the most overused rhythmic pattern in 1950s rock n roll on numerous recordings by fats domino little richard and others bartholomew assigned this repeating threenote pattern not just to the string bass but also to electric guitars and even baritone sax making for a very heavy bottom he recalls first hearing the figure – as a bass pattern on a cuban disc40 in a 1988 interview with palmer bartholomew who had the first rb studio band41 revealed how he initially superimposed tresillo over swing rhythm i heard the bass playing that part on a rumba record on country boy i had my bass and drums playing a straight swing rhythm and wrote out that rumba bass part for the saxes to play on top of the swing rhythm later especially after rock n roll came along i made the rumba bass part heavier and heavier id have the string bass an electric guitar and a baritone all in unison42 bartholomew referred to the cuban son by the misnomer rumba a common practice of that time listen country boy by dave bartholomew 1949 on youtube fats dominos blue monday produced by bartholomew is another example of this now classic use of tresillo in rb listen fats dominos blue monday 1956 on youtube on bartholomews 1949 tresillobased oh cubanas we clearly hear an attempt to blend african american and afrocuban music the word mambo larger than any of the other text is placed prominently on the 45 label in his composition misery new orleans pianist professor longhair henry roeland byrd plays a habaneralike figure in his left hand the deft use of triplets is a characteristic of longhairs style misery by professor longhair 1957 gerhard kubik notes that with the exception of new orleans early blues lacked complex polyrhythms and there was a very specific absence of asymmetric timeline patterns key patterns in virtually all earlytwentiethcentury african american music only in some new orleans genres does a hint of simple time line patterns occasionally appear in the form of transient socalled stomp patterns or stoptime chorus these do not function in the same way as african time lines43 in the late 1940s this changed somewhat when the twocelled time line structure was brought into the blues new orleans musicians such as bartholomew and longhair incorporated cuban instruments as well as the clave pattern and related twocelled figures in songs such as carnival day bartholomew 1949 and mardi gras in new orleans longhair 1949 while some of these early experiments were awkward fusions the afrocuban elements were eventually integrated fully into the new orleans sound robert palmer reports that in the 1940s professor longhair listened to and played with musicians from the islands and fell under the spell of perez prados mambo records44 he was especially enamored with afrocuban music michael campbell states professor longhairs influence was far reaching in several of his early recordings professor longhair blended afrocuban rhythms with rhythm and blues the most explicit is longhairs blues rhumba where he overlays a straightforward blues with a clave rhythm45 longhairs particular style was known locally as rumbaboogie46 in his mardi gras in new orleans the pianist employs the 2–3 clave onbeatoffbeat motif in a rumba boogie guajeo below47 2–3 clave is written above the piano excerpt for reference piano excerpt from the rumba boogie mardi gras in new orleans 1949 by professor longhair 2–3 clave is written above for rhythmic reference the syncopated but straight subdivision feel of cuban music as opposed to swung subdivisions took root in new orleans rb during this time alexander stewart states that the popular feel was passed along from new orleans—through james browns music to the popular music of the 1970s adding the singular style of rhythm blues that emerged from new orleans in the years after world war ii played an important role in the development of funk in a related development the underlying rhythms of american popular music underwent a basic yet generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes48 concerning the various funk motifs stewart states this model it should be noted is different from a time line such as clave and tresillo in that it is not an exact pattern but more of a loose organizing principle49 johnny otis released the rb mambo mambo boogie in january 1951 featuring congas maracas claves and mambo saxophone guajeos in a blues progression50 listen mambo boogie by johnny otis 1951 on youtube ike turner recorded cubano jump 1954 an electric guitar instrumental which is built around several 2–3 clave figures adopted from the mambo listen cubano jump by ike turner 1954 on youtube the hawketts in mardi gras mambo 1955 featuring the vocals of a young art neville make a clear reference to perez prado in their use of his trademark unhh in the break after the introduction51 listen mardi gras mambo by the hawketts 1955 on youtube ned sublette states the electric blues cats were very well aware of latin music and there was definitely such a thing as rhumba blues you can hear muddy waters and howlin wolf playing it52 he also cites otis rush ike turner and ray charles as rb artists who employed this feel52 the use of clave in rb coincided with the growing dominance of the backbeat and the rising popularity of cuban music in the us in a sense clave can be distilled down to tresillo threeside answered by the backbeat twoside53 32 clave written in two measures in cuttime tresillo answered by the backbeat the essence of clave in african american music the bo diddley beat 1955 is perhaps the first true fusion of 32 clave and rbrock n roll watch hey bo diddley performed live by bo diddley 1965 on youtube bo diddley has given different accounts of the riffs origins sublette asserts in the context of the time and especially those maracas heard on the record bo diddley has to be understood as a latintinged record a rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only rhumba on the track sheets54 johnny otis willie and the hand jive 1958 is another example of this successful blend of 3–2 clave and rb watch hand jive performed by johnny otis the johnny otis show on youtube otis used the cuban instruments claves and maracas on the song bo diddleys bo diddley beat is a clavebased motif afrocuban music was the conduit by which african american music was reafricanized through the adoption of twocelled figures like clave and afrocuban instruments like the conga drum bongos maracas and claves according to john storm roberts rb became the vehicle for the return of cuban elements into mass popular music55 ahmet ertegun producer for atlantic records is reported to have said that afrocuban rhythms added color and excitement to the basic drive of rb56 as ned sublette points out though by the 1960s with cuba the object of a united states embargo that still remains in effect today the island nation had been forgotten as a source of music by the time people began to talk about rock and roll as having a history cuban music had vanished from north american consciousness57 early to mid1950sedit ray charles in 1971 photo heinrich klaffs at first only african americans were buying rb discs according to jerry wexler of atlantic records sales were localized in africanamerican markets there was no white sales nor white radio play during the early 1950s more white teenagers started to become aware of rb and to purchase the music for example 40 of 1952 sales at dolphins of hollywood record shop located in an africanamerican area of los angeles were to whites eventually white teens across the country turned their music taste towards rhythm and blues58 johnny otis who had signed with the newark new jerseybased savoy records produced many rb hits in 1951 including double crossing blues mistrustin blues and cupids boogie all of which hit number one that year otis scored ten top ten hits that year other hits include gee baby mambo boogie and all nite long59 the clovers a vocal trio who sang a distinctive sounding combination of blues and gospel60 had the 5 hit of the year with dont you know i love you on atlantic records596162 also in july 1951 cleveland ohio dj alan freed started a latenight radio show called the moondog rock roll house party on wjw 850 am63not in citation given freeds show was sponsored by fred mintz whose rb record store had a primarily african american clientele freed began referring to the rhythm and blues music he played as rock and roll in 1951 little richard penniman began recording for rca records in the jump blues style of late 1940s stars roy brown and billy wright however it was not until he prepared a demo in 1954 that caught the attention of specialty records that the world would start to hear his new uptempo funky rhythm and blues that would catapult him to fame in 1955 and help define the sound of rock n roll a rapid succession of rhythm and blues hits followed beginning with tutti frutti64 and long tall sally which would influence performers such as james brown65 elvis presley66 and otis redding67 ruth brown on the atlantic label placed hits in the top 5 every year from 1951 through 1954 teardrops from my eyes five ten fifteen hours mama he treats your daughter mean and what a dream60 faye adamss shake a hand made it to 2 in 1952 in 1953 the rb recordbuying public made willie mae thorntons original recording of leiber and stollers hound dog68 the 3 hit that year ruth brown was very prominent among female rb stars ruth browns popularity most likely derived because of her deeply rooted vocal delivery in african american tradition69 70 that same year the orioles a doowop group had the 4 hit of the year with crying in the chapel71 fats domino made the top 30 of the pop charts in 1952 and 1953 then the top 10 with aint that a shame7273 ray charles came to national prominence in 1955 with i got a woman74 big bill broonzy said of charles music hes mixing the blues with the spirituals i know thats wrong14173 in 1954 the chords shboom75 became the first hit to cross over from the rb chart to hit the top 10 early in the year late

popularized bo diddleys own original rhythm and blues clavebased vamp that would become a mainstay in rock and roll77 at the urging of leonard chess at chess records chuck berry had reworked a country fiddle tune with a long history entitled ida red78 the resulting maybellene was not only a 3 hit on the rb charts in 1955 but also reached into the top 30 on the pop charts alan freed who had moved to the much larger market of new york city in 1954 helped the record become popular with white teenagers freed had been given part of the writers credit by chess in return for his promotional activities a common practice at the time79 late 1950sedit della reese in 1956 an rb top stars of 56 tour took place with headliners al hibbler frankie lymon and the teenagers and carl perkins whose blue suede

gordys motown records84 brook benton was at the top of the rb charts in 1959 and 1960 with one 1 and two 2 hits benton had a certain warmth in his voice that attracted a wide variety of listeners and his ballads led to comparisons with performers such as cole sinatra and tony bennett85 lloyd price who in 1952 had a 1 hit with lawdy miss clawdy regained predominance with a version of stagger lee at

was labeled blue eyed soul9192 motown records had its first millionselling single in 1960 with the miracles shop around93 and in 1961 stax records had its first hit with carla thomas gee whiz look at

development of ska979899 in 1969 black culture and rhythm and blues reached another great achievement when the grammys first added the rhythm and blues category giving academic recognition to the category this category was created 10 years after the first grammy awards took place by the 1970s the term rhythm and blues was being used as a blanket term for soul funk and disco100 around the same time earlier rb was an influence on british pub rock and later the mod revival now the term rb is almost always used instead of the full rhythm and blues and mainstream use of the term usually refers to contemporary rb which is a newer version of soul and funkinfluenced pop music that originated as disco faded from popularity 1980s to presentedit main article contemporary rb r kelly in the late 1980s and early 1990s hiphop started to capture the imagination of americas youth rb started to become homogenized with a group of high profile producers responsible for most rb hits it was hard for rb artists of the era to sell their music or even have their music heard because of the rise of hiphop but some adopted a hiphop image were marketed as such and often featured rappers on their songs newer artists such as usher r kelly tlc aaliyah beyoncé christina aguilera and mary j blige enjoyed success la reid the ceo of laface records was responsible for some of rbs greatest successes in the 1990s in the form of usher tlc and toni braxton later reid successfully marketed boyz ii men101 in 2004 80 of the songs that topped the rb charts were also on top of the hot 100 that period was the alltime peak for rb and hip hop on the billboard hot 100 and on top 40 radio102 from about 2005 to 2013 rb sales declined103 however since 2010 hiphop has started to take from the rb sound choosing to adopt a softer smoother sound incorporating that of traditional rb with rappers such as drake and fetty wap who have opened an entire new door for the genre this sound has gained in popularity and created great controversy for both hiphop and rb in how to identify it 104 british rhythm and bluesedit main article british rhythm and blues eric burdon the animals 1964 british rhythm and blues developed in the early 1960s largely as a response to the recordings of american artists often brought over by african american servicemen stationed in britain during the cold war or merchant seamen visiting ports such as london liverpool newcastle upon tyne and belfast105106 many bands particularly in the developing london club scene tried to emulate black rhythm and blues performers resulting in a rawer or grittier sound than the more popular beat groups107 initially developing out of the trad jazz skiffle and folk club scenes early artists tended to focus on major blues performers and standard forms particularly alexis korner who acted as a mentor to members of the rolling stones the yardbirds manfred mann the graham bond organisation and the kinks107 although this purist interest in the blues would influence major british rock musicians including eric clapton jeff beck peter green and jimmy page other artists adopted an interest in a wider range of rhythm and blues styles107 most successful were the rolling stones whose first eponymously titled album in 1964 largely consisted of rhythm and blues standards they soon established themselves as the second most popular uk band after the beatles108 and led a second wave of the british invasion of the us pop charts107 in addition to chicago blues numbers the rolling stones also covered songs by chuck berry and bobby and shirley womack with the latters its all over now giving them their first uk number one in 1964109 blues songs and influences continued to surface in the rolling stones music in later years other londonbased bands included the yardbirds the kinks manfred mann and the pretty things beside more jazzinfluenced acts like the graham bond organisation georgie fame and zoot money107 bands to emerge from other major british cities included the animals from newcastle upon tyne110 the moody blues and spencer davis group from birmingham and them from belfast107 none of these bands played exclusively rhythm and blues but it remained at the core of their early albums107 the music of the british mod subculture grew out of rhythm and blues and later soul performed by artists that were not available to the small london clubs where the scene originated111 as a result a number of bands emerged to fill this gap including small faces the creation and most successfully the who111 the whos early promotional material tagged them as producing maximum rhythm and blues but by about 1966 they moved from attempting to emulate american rb to producing songs that reflected the mod lifestyle111 many of these bands enjoyed national success in the uk but found it difficult to break into the american market111 the british rb bands produced music which was very different in tone from that of africanamerican artists often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy107 they have been criticized for exploiting the massive catalogue of africanamerican music but it has also been noted that they both popularized that music bringing it to british world and in some cases american audiences and helped to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists107 most of these bands rapidly moved on from recording and performing american standards to writing and recording their own music often leaving their rb roots behind107 many helped pioneer psychedelic and eventually progressive and hard rock having a major influence on the nature and sound of rock music making rhythm and blues a major component of its sound107 see alsoedit rb and soul music portal
