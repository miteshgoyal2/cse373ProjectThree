also economic conservatism or conservative economics is a politicaleconomic philosophy regarding fiscal policy and fiscal responsibility advocating low taxes reduced government spending and minimal government debt1 free trade deregulation of the economy lower taxes and privatization are the defining qualities of fiscal conservatism fiscal conservatism follows the same philosophical outlook of classical liberalism and economic liberalism 2 the term has its origins in era of the new deal during the 1930s as a result of the policies of the initiated by reform or modern liberals many classical liberals started calling themselves conservatives as they did not wish to be identified with what was passing for liberalism3 in the united states the term liberalism has become associated with the welfare state and expanded regulatory policies created as a result of the new deal and its offshoots from the 1930s onwards4 fiscal conservatives form one of the three legs of the traditional conservative movement in the united states together with social conservatism and national defense conservatism5 many americans who are classical liberals also tend to identify as libertarian6 holding more socially liberal views and advocating a noninterventionist foreign policy while supporting lower taxes and less government spending5 contents 1 overview 11 principles 12 factions or subgroups 2

parties 3 rest of the world 4 see also 5 notes 6 references 7 further reading 8 external links overviewedit principlesedit fiscal conservatism is the economic philosophy of prudence in government spending and debt7 fiscal conservatives advocate the avoidance of deficit spending the reduction of overall government spending and national debt and ensuring balanced budgets in other words fiscal conservatives are against the government expanding beyond its means through debt but will usually choose debt over tax increases edmund burke in his reflections on the revolution in france argued that a government does not have the right to run up large debts and then throw the burden on the taxpayer it is to the property of the citizen and not to the demands of the creditor of the state that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged the claim of the citizen is prior in time paramount in title superior in equity the fortunes of individuals whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community were no part of the creditors security expressed or implied  the public whether represented by a monarch or by a senate can pledge nothing but the public estate and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large factions or subgroupsedit although all fiscal conservatives agree generally on a smaller and less expensive government there are disagreements over priorities5 there are three main factions or subgroups each advocating for a particular emphasis deficit hawks emphasize balancing government budgets and reducing the size of government debt and view government debt as economically damaging and morally dubious since it passes on obligations on to future generations who have played no part in presentday tax and spending decisions5 deficit hawks are willing to consider tax increases if the additional revenue is used to reduce debt rather than increase spending5 a second group put their main emphasis on tax cuts rather than spending cuts or debt reduction many embrace supplyside economics arguing that as high taxes discourage economic activity and investment tax cuts would result in economic growth leading in turn to higher government revenues5 these additional government revenues would in the long term reduce debt they also argue for reducing taxes even if it were to lead to short term increases in the deficit5 some supplysiders have even advocated that the increases in revenue through tax cuts make drastic cuts in spending unnecessary5 however the congressional budget office has consistently reported that income tax cuts increase deficits and debt and do not pay for themselves for example the cbo estimated that the bush tax cuts added about 15 trillion to deficits and debt from 200220118 and would have added nearly 3 trillion to deficits and debt over the 20102019 decade if fully extended at all income levels9 a third group makes little distinction between debt and taxes this group emphasizes reduction in spending rather than tax policy or debt reduction10 they argue that the true cost of government is the level of spending not how that spending is financed5 every dollar that the government spends is a dollar taken from american workers regardless whether it is from debt or taxes taxes simply redistribute purchasing power doing so in a particularly inefficient manner reducing the incentives to produce or hire and borrowing simply forces businesses and investors to anticipate higher taxes later on10 historyedit late 18th centuryedit the democraticrepublican party of thomas jefferson supported a weak central government and a more laissezfaire approach than that of the federalist party of jeffersons rival alexander hamilton they opposed hamiltons plan to pay off the debts owed by the states for the expense of the american revolution because some of the debt was held by financiers and speculators rather than the original holders and because most of the debt was held by northern states hamilton passed his legislation and set up taxes to pay the debts in exchange he agreed to let jefferson move the nations capital to washington dc early 19th centuryedit jefferson strongly opposed having any national debt but he relented in 1803 for the sake of the louisiana purchase james madison and james monroe were elected by the democraticrepublican party but after the fiscal disasters of the war of 1812 they came to support most federalist positions and decided that the nation needed a central bank and a steady income flow from tariffs early to mid 20th centuryedit in the early 20th century fiscal conservatives were often at odds with progressives who desired economic reform during the 1920s president calvin coolidges probusiness economic policies were credited for the successful period of economic growth known as the roaring twenties his actions however may have been due more to a sense of federalism than fiscal conservatism robert sobel notes as governor of massachusetts coolidge supported wages and hours legislation opposed child labor imposed economic controls during world war i favored safety measures in factories and even worker representation on corporate boards11 the conservative economic and fiscal policies of herbert hoover are often popularly contrasted with the new deal deficit spending of franklin d roosevelt and republican party opposition to roosevelts government spending was a unifying cause for a significant caucus of republicans through even the presidencies of truman and eisenhower barry goldwater was a famous champion of both the socially and fiscally conservative republicans reagan eraedit reagan spent the most of any recent president measured as annual average  gdp main article reaganomics fiscal conservatism was rhetorically promoted during the presidency of ronald reagan 1981–1989 during reagans tenure the top personal income tax bracket dropped from 70 to 2812 while payroll taxes and the effective tax rates on the lower two income quintiles increased1314 real gdp growth recovered strongly after the 1982 recession growing at an annual rate of 34 for the rest of his time in office15 unemployment dropped after peaking at over 107 percent in 1982 and inflation decreased significantly16 federal tax receipts nearly doubled from 517 billion in 1980 to 1032 billion in 1990 employment grew at about the same rate as population according to a united states department of the treasury nonpartisan economic study the major tax bills enacted under reagan caused federal revenue to fall by an amount equal to roughly 1 of gdp17 by the end of reagans second term the national debt held by the public increased by almost 60 and the total debt equalled 26 trillion in fewer than eight years the us went from being the worlds largest creditor nation to the worlds largest debtor nation18 ross perotedit main article ross perot presidential campaign 1992 in the 1992 presidential election ross perot a successful american businessman ran as a thirdparty candidate despite significant campaign stumbles and the uphill struggles involved in mounting a thirdparty candidacy perot received 189 of the popular vote the largest percentage of any thirdparty candidate in modern history largely on the basis of his central platform plank of limitedgovernment balancedbudget fiscal conservatism clinton eraedit main article clintonomics the ominibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 increased the average federal tax rates for the top 1 while lowering average tax rates for the middle class president obama also raised tax rates for higher income persons starting in 2013 through the partial expiration of the bush tax cuts the clinton and obama tax increases lowered deficits relative to cbo policy baselines without them while the mantle of fiscal conservatism is most commonly claimed by republicans and libertarians it is also claimed in some ways by many centrist or moderate democrats who often refer to themselves as new democrats though not supportive of the wide range tax cut policies that were often enacted during the reagan and bush administrations1920 the new democrat coalitions primary economic agenda differed from the traditional tax and spend philosophy held among liberal democrats and sided with the fiscal conservative belief that certain things needed to be cut in order to balance the federal budget20 former president bill clinton who was a new democrat and part of the somewhat fiscally conservative third way advocating democratic leadership council is a prime example of this as his administration along with the democraticmajority congress of 1993 passed on a partyline vote the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 which cut government spending created a 36 individual income tax bracket raised the top tax bracket which encompassed the top 12 earning taxpayers from 31 to 396 and created a 35 income tax rate for corporations21 the 1993 budget act also cut taxes for fifteen million lowincome families and 90 of small businesses additionally during the clinton years the paygo payasyougo system originally introduced with the passing of the budget enforcement act of 1990 which required that all increases in direct spending or revenue decreases be offset by other spending decreases or revenue increases and was very popular with deficit hawks had gone into effect and was used regularly until the systems expiration in 2002 in the 1994 midterm elections republicans ran on a platform that included fiscal responsibility drafted by thencongressman newt gingrich called the contract with america which advocated such things as balancing the budget providing the president with a lineitem veto and welfare reform after the elections gave the republicans a majority in the house of representatives newly minted speaker of the house gingrich pushed aggressively for reduced government spending which created a confrontation with the white house that climaxed in the 1995–1996 government shutdown after clintons reelection in 1996 they were able to cooperate and pass the taxpayer relief act of 1997 which lowered the top capital gains tax rate from 28 to 20 and the 15 rate to 10 after this combination of tax hikes and spending reductions the united states was able to create the largest federal budget surplus 236 billion in fiscal year 2000 as well as the longest period of sustained economic growth in united states history222324 modern fiscal conservatism in the united statesedit comparison of annual federal deficits cbo 10year forecast from prior to inauguration vs the actual amount during the obama and gw bush presidencies bush added far more to the debt relative to the cbo 2001 forecast than obama added relative to the cbo 2009 forecast modern fiscal conservatives remain wary of government spending they believe strongly in free trade and are committed to lowering the federal budget paying off national debt and acquiring a balanced budget25 where fiscal conservatism gets more diverse in ideals is what steps should be taken to balance the budget deficit hawks are more willing to increase taxes in addition to cutting spending to balance the budget than libertarians who want to starve the beast by cutting taxes for the purpose of decreasing tax revenue which they hope will cause the government to spend less and supplysiders who believe that government revenue will increase by lowering taxes american businessman politician and former mayor of new york city michael bloomberg considers himself a fiscal conservative and expressed his definition of the term at the 2007 united kingdom conservative party conference “ to me fiscal conservatism means balancing budgets – not running deficits that the next generation cant afford it means improving the efficiency of delivering services by finding innovative ways to do more with less it means cutting taxes when possible and prudent to do so raising them overall only when necessary to balance the budget and only in combination with spending cuts it means when you run a surplus you save it you dont squander it and most importantly being a fiscal conservative means preparing for the inevitable economic downturns – and by all indications weve got one coming —michael bloomberg26 ” fiscal conservative partiesedit republican party libertarian party democratic party rest of the worldedit as a result of the expansion of the welfare state and increased regulatory policies by the roosevelt administration beginning in the 1930s the term liberalism in the united states today has become associated with modern rather than classical liberalism4 in western europe however the expanded welfare states created after the second world war were created by socialist or social democratic parties such as the british labour party rather than liberal parties4 as a result many liberal parties in western europe tend to adhere to classical liberalism the free democratic party in germany being one example4 the liberal democrats in the uk have a classical and a social liberal wing of the party in many countries liberalism or neoliberalism is used to describe what americans call fiscal conservatism4272 fiscal conservatism in the uk was arguably most popular during the premiership of margaret thatcher who after a number of years of deficit spending under the previous labour government advocated spending cuts and selective tax increases to balance the budget in 2010 as a result of the deterioration in the uks public finances—according to fiscal conservatives caused by another spate of deficit spending under the previous labour government the late2000s recession and by the european sovereign debt crisis—the liberal democratconservative coalition embarked on an austerity programme featuring a combination of spending cuts and tax rises in an attempt to halve the deficit and completely eliminate the structural deficit over the fiveyear parliament28 in canada the rise of the socialist cooperative commonwealth federation ccf pushed the liberal party to create and expand the welfare state before and after world war ii4 fiscal conservatism in canada is generally referred to as blue toryism when it is present within the conservative party of canada29 in alberta fiscal conservatism is represented by the wildrose party30 see alsoedit austerity balance of payments balance of trade capitalism classical liberalism criticisms of
