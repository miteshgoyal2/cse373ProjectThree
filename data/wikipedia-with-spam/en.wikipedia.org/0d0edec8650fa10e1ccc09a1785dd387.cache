part of an itv documentary living with michael jackson which uri geller a friend of jacksons had arranged following the broadcast which was viewed by 14 million in the uk and 38 million in the us jackson complained to the independent television commission and the broadcasting standards commission accusing bashir of yellow journalism in response jackson and his personal cameraman released a rebuttal interview which showed bashir complimenting jackson for the spiritual quality of the neverland ranch bashir defended the documentary stating i dont believe that ive betrayed michael jackson at all i agreed that we would make an honest film about his life the film was fair to his musical achievement and gave him every opportunity to explain himself im not accusing anybody of being a child molester or a paedophile8 dieter wiesner the pop stars manager from 1996 to 2003 said of bashirs documentary “ it broke jackson it killed him he took a long time to die but it started that night previously the drugs were a crutch but after that they became a necessity9 ” bashir later said during abcs coverage of jacksons death “ i think all of us were shocked and deeply saddened by the news today i was actually out running in central park when i heard and came home showered and came into the office many of us were excited about the prospect of him performing in london thousands of people had bought tickets from all over the world and now to hear this news is very very sad i think its worth remembering he was probably singly the greatest dancer and musician the world has ever seen certainly when i made the documentary there was a small part of that which contained a controversy concerning his relationship with other young people but the truth is that he was never convicted of any crime i never saw any wrongdoing myself and whilst his lifestyle may have been a bit unorthodox i dont believe it was criminal and i think the world has now lost the greatest entertainer its probably ever known10 ” juju chang comments and suspension at abc newsedit in 2008 while working as a reporter for nightline bashir was suspended from abc news after making comments considered crude and sexist during a dinner speech at the asian american journalists association convention in chicago211 during the speech he stated im happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes im happy that the podium covers me from the waist down11 he continued and said that a speech should be like a dress on a beautiful woman – long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep your interest – like my colleague jujus11 referring to bashirs abc news colleague juju chang a reporter for 202011 abc news suspended him11 he wrote an apology to the journalist association which stated upon reflection it was a tasteless remark that i now bitterly regret i … hope that the continuing work of the organization will not be harmed or undermined by my moment of stupidity11 sarah palin comments and resignation from msnbcedit on 15 november 2013 bashir criticized sarah palin for comments that she made comparing the federal debt to slavery12 bashir attempted to counter palins comparison by referencing the punishment of slaves described by slave overseer thomas thistlewood specifically a punishment called derbys dose which involved forcing slaves to defecate or urinate into the mouth of another slave as punishment bashir then concluded by saying if anyone truly qualified for a dose of discipline from thomas thistlewood she would be the outstanding candidate1314 after manycitation needed complaints bashir apologized on 18 november stating among other things my words were wholly unacceptable they were neither accurate nor fair they were unworthy of anyone who would claim to have an interest in politics1415 on 2 december bashir was suspended by the network and then resigned two days later3141617 he issued a statement upon his resignation that said i deeply regret
