academy of television arts sciences atas established the emmy award as part of an imagebuilding and public relations opportunity3 the first emmy awards ceremony took place on january 25 1949 at the hollywood athletic club but solely to honor shows produced and aired locally in the los angeles area shirley dinsdale has the distinction of receiving the very first emmy award for most outstanding television personality during that first awards ceremony3 the term “emmy” is a french alteration of the television crew slang term “immy” the nickname for an “image orthicon” a camera tube used in tv production 4 in the 1950s the atas expanded the emmys into a national event presenting the awards to shows aired nationwide on broadcast television in 1955 the national academy of television arts and sciences natas was formed in new york city as a sister organization to serve members on the east coast and help to also supervise the emmys the natas also established regional chapters throughout the united states with each one developing their own local emmy awards show for local programming3 the atas still however maintained its separate regional ceremony honoring local programming in the los angeles area5 originally there was only one emmy awards ceremony held per year to honor shows nationally broadcast in the united states in 1974 the first daytime emmy awards ceremony was held to specifically honor achievement in national daytime programming other areaspecific emmy awards ceremonies soon followed also the international emmy awards honoring television programs produced and initially aired outside the us was established in the early 1970s3 meanwhile all emmys awarded prior to the emergence of these separate areaspecific ceremonies are listed along with the primetime emmy awards in the atas official records6 in 1977 due to various conflicts the atas and the natas agreed to split ties however they also agreed to share ownership of the emmy statue and trademark with each responsible for administering a specific set of award ceremonies3 there was an exception regarding the engineering awards those honoring individuals companies or to scientific or technical organizations in recognition of significant developments and contributions to the engineering and technological aspects of television the natas continues to administer the technology engineering emmy awards while the atas holds the separate primetime engineering emmy awards with the rise of cable television in the 1980s cable programs first became eligible for the primetime emmys in 19887 and the daytime emmys in 19898 in 2011 the abc television network cancelled the soap operas all my children and one life to live and sold the two shows licensing rights to the production company prospect park so they could be continued on web television this prompted natas to create a new daytime emmys category for the 2013 ceremony to honor such webonly series9 the atas also began accepting original onlineonly web television programs in 201310 emmy statuetteedit the emmy statuette depicting a winged woman holding an atom was designed by television engineer louis mcmanus who used his wife as the model the tv academy rejected a total of fortyseven proposals before settling on mcmanus design in 1948 the statuette has since become the symbol of the tv academys goal of supporting and uplifting the art and science of television the wings represent the muse of art the atom the electron of science11 when deciding a name for the award academy founder syd cassyd originally suggested ike the nickname for the television iconoscope tube however ike was also the popular nickname of world war ii hero and future us president dwight d eisenhower and the academy members wanted something unique finally television engineer and the third academy president harry lubcke suggested the name immy a term commonly used for the image orthicon tube used in the early cameras11 after immy was chosen it was later feminized to emmy to match their female statuette11 each primetime emmy statuette weighs six pounds twelveandahalf ounces 308 kg and is made of copper nickel silver and gold the statue stands 155 inches 39 cm tall with a base diameter of 75 inches 19 cm and weight of 88 oz 25 kg the regional emmy award statuette is 115 inches 29 cm tall with a base diameter of 55 inches 14 cm and weight of 48 oz 14 kg each takes five and a half hours to make and is handled with white gloves to prevent fingerprints the regional emmy awards are made by society awards a new yorkbased company that also makes the golden globe awards the primetime emmy statues are manufactured by rs owens company based out of chicago illinois which is also charged with manufacturing the academy award statues1213 as its trademark owners the atas and the natas hold firm rules on the use of the emmy image as well as its name for example the emmy statuette must always appear facing left any copyright notice for the statue should read atasnatas listing both academies academy members must also obtain permission to use the statue image or name for promotional uses even though they are winners of the award furthermore dvds of emmywinning shows may reference the fact that they received an emmy but cannot use the statue image unless it is capable of being removed from all copies after one year after the award is presented1415 areaspecific ceremoniesedit actress dana delany holding a primetime emmy award in 1992 tv producer and writer bradley bell accepting daytime emmy awards for his work on the daytime soap opera the bold and the beautiful in 2010 the emmys are presented in various areaspecific ceremonies held annually throughout the calendar year ranging from honoring nationally televised shows to regionally and locally produced programs each ceremony has its own set of award categories nominating and voting procedures and rules regarding voting committees it is not uncommon for one ceremony to have some of the same category names that other emmy ceremonies use eg primetime emmy for outstanding drama series and daytime emmy award for outstanding drama series a show that enters into one of the national emmy competitions cannot also be entered into any of the others for example syndicated shows whose air times vary between media markets may be eligible for both the daytime and primetime emmys but cannot enter in both16 in general a show is considered national if it reaches more than 50 percent of us households programs that do not reach at least 50 percent of the country may enter into the regional emmys instead web television shows are treated similar to syndicated shows they must be available for downloading or streaming by more than 50 percent of the us
