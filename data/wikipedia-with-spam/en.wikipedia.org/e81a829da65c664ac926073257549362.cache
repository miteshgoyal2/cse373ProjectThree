world tour live in seoul the recording is a performance of the bad world tour performing songs from the album bad the music video for the song another part of me features footage from other concerts in wembley as well as paris this particular concert took place on july 16 1988 at wembley stadium in wembley london to a soldout crowd of 72000 which included diana princess of wales and charles prince of wales jackson originally removed dirty diana from this nights performance worried that he would offend princess diana or the royal family however the princess informed jackson it was her favorite song in an interview jackson stated that he was unable to put the song into the set which led some fans to believe dirty diana was not performed on july 16 however leaked audio snippets prove that the song was readded to the setlist12 in addition to the full july 16 concert the dvd also includes the way you make me feel from the previous night on july 15 the song was not performed on july 16 due to a late start of the show and i just cant stop loving you and bad performed on september 26 1987 in yokohama japan the bad 25 deluxe package also contains a cd of the audio from the july 16

october 2012 learn how and when to remove this template message according to the official bad 25 statement released by the estate of michael jackson the video is sourced from jacksons personal vhs copy of the show the only known copy in existence the audio however has been sourced by a highquality multitrack recording snippets of which have leaked online in mid2011 to positive fan reception some of this is from the preceding concert on july 15 both the july 15 and 16 concerts are the only known multitrack audio recordings of the bad tour some fans have taken concern over the video quality of the dvd after a portion of jacksons performance of bad from the dvd was shown on itv on may 31 2012 coheads of jacksons estate john mcclain and john branca released an official statement regarding the quality concerns it was revealed that due to poor storage and possible carelessness dozens of umatic performance masters including those from wembley could not be located confirming that jacksons vhs copy is the only known copy of the concert mcclain and branca also revealed that multiple umatic masters of other performances from the tour did exist but were unusable one of the few usable master recordings the estate possesses from the bad tour was the performance in yokohama japan in 1987 however the estate opted not to release this as they considered it to be nothing more than an modified version of the victory tour with three extra songs this concert also aired on japanese television and goodquality bootleg dvds exist as a result the estate stated that a video enhancement lab was hired to restore the vhs copy of wembley34 critical receptionedit this article is incomplete please help to improve it or discuss the issue on the talk page september 2012 critical reception on the concert itself has mostly been positive chaz lipp described the concert as simply incredible from start to finish there has still been a mixed reaction among some fans with regard to the quality of the video some felt that the original umatic video elements should have been located before the release was authorized randall roberts of the los angeles times criticized the audio mix its a solid if thinly recorded document that lacks sonic heft the rhythm section sounds a mile away and lacks the pop of a wellrecorded concert5 michael jones of blog critics had this to say these two recordings just exude pure energy and while watching it i’m thunderstruck by how effortless this lithe little man seems to make spending over two hours singing and dancing his absolute heart out for thousands of adoring fans i get tired just lipsyncing and trying to do the occasional move with just my arms while watching 6 the second disc had a glowing review of the wembley dvd saying the picture quality is clearly that of a videocassette but it doesn’t detract from a stunning performance and the camera work is generally strong with wellchosen angles within moments of opening with “wanna be startin’ somethin’” jackson is posing gyrating spinning kicking stomping and slithering with a sleek fleetness of foot that whips the audience into a frenzied state he’s both graceful and sexually charged and he is the productionwhile the singer appears to be lipsynching to a handful of the songs his performance is largely overwhelming and frequently playful the remarkably wellsequenced concert shows jackson as an utterly comfortable presence smiling and taking the stage with ease there’s very little patter as he prefers to concentrate on his angular bob fosseinthefuture choreographic moves and unstoppable anthems by the time he dons his famous glove and launches into that mesmerizing moonwalk on “billie jean” it seems that jackson can’t possibly give any more but he does dancing with a chorus line of kids in the closing “bad” and literally dropping to the floor for the encore of “man in the mirror” 7 evan sawdey of popmatters gave a positive review of the dvd giving it a 7 out of 10 saying here jackson is at the peak of his powers absolutely bursting with energy extended dance breaks are added into the songs his backing quartet of dancers are extremely precise and yes that’s 80s sheryl crow coming out to duet with him on “i just can’t stop loving youyet the show is remarkably fun and relatively fastpaced there are multiple costume changes throughout with jackson wearing whatever jacket is appropriate for the song he’s singing a letterman jacket for “thriller” a white coat and fedora for “smooth criminal” that signature black leather for “bad” at first he and his dancers could not be tighter they exude energy and perhaps what’s most remarkable is how jackson is able to still singsustain notes while doing his numerous laserprecise moves by the time he starts moonwalking during “billie jean” and let there be no mistake this is as spectacular and smooth as he has ever executed the move the alreadynuts crowd simply goes into overdrive8 chaz lipp of the morton report had this to say about jacksons performance perhaps the best part of bad 25 is the full concert recorded live at london’s wembley stadium july 16 1988 this is simply prime michael jackson he’s in fantastic voice throughout always in control of his instrument—even during the most delicate moments such as “she’s out of my life” i’d list some highlights but at the risk of sounding hyperbolic the whole thing functions as a highlight this concert is relatively stripped down visually making it a perfect contrast to the more elaborately produced live in bucharest the dangerous tour dvd jackson’s dancing is as mesmerizing as ever on full display during tunes such as “smooth criminal” and of course “billie jean” 9 track listingedit no title writers length 1 wanna be startin
