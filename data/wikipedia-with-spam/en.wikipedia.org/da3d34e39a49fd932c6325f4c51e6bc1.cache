rhythms samples and production techniques of hip hop and dancepop with the urban contemporary sound of rb the new jack swing style developed as many previous music styles did by combining elements of older styles with newer sensibilities it used rb style vocals sung over hip hop and dancepop style influenced instrumentation the sound of new jack swing comes from the hip hop swing beats created by
