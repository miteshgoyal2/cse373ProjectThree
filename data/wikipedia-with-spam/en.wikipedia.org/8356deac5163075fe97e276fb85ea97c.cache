worldwide15 the years between off the wall and thriller were a transitional period for jackson a time of increased independence16 the period saw the singer become deeply unhappy jackson explained even at home im lonely i sit in my room sometimes and cry its so hard to make friends i sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night just hoping to find someone to talk to but i just end up coming home17 when jackson turned 21 in august 1979 he hired john branca as his manager18 jackson confided in branca that he wanted to be the biggest star in show business and the wealthiest jackson was upset about what he perceived to be the underperformance of off the wall stating it was totally unfair that it didnt get record of the year and it can never happen again19 he also felt undervalued by the music industry in 1980 when jackson asked the publicist of rolling stone if they would be interested in doing a cover story on him the publicist declined to which jackson responded ive been told over and over that black people on the cover of magazines doesnt sell copies just wait someday those magazines are going to be begging me for an interview maybe ill give them one and maybe i wont19 recordingedit quincy jones continued his collaboration with jackson by producing thriller jackson reunited with off the wall producer quincy jones to record his sixth studio album his second under the epic label the pair worked together on 30 songs nine of which were eventually included20 thriller was recorded at westlake recording studios in los angeles california with a production budget of 750000 us1861293 in 2016 dollars21 the recording for thriller commenced on april 14 1982 at 1200 noon with jackson and paul mccartney recording the girl is mine and the album was completed with the final day of mixing on november 8 198222 several members of the band toto were also involved in the albums recording and production20 jackson wrote four songs for the record wanna be startin somethin the girl is mine beat it and billie jean23 unlike many artists jackson did not write these songs on paper instead he would dictate into a sound recorder when recording he would sing from memory2425 the relationship between jackson and jones became strained during the albums recording jackson spent much of his time rehearsing dance steps alone25 when the albums nine songs were completed both jones and jackson were unhappy with the result and remixed every song spending a week on each25 jackson was inspired to create an album where every song was a killer and developed thriller with that in mind2627 jones and songwriter rod temperton gave detailed accounts of what occurred for the 2001 reissue of the album jones discussed billie jean and why it was so personal to jackson who struggled to deal with a number of obsessed fans jones wanted the long introduction on the song to be shortened however jackson insisted that it remain because it made him want to dance23 the ongoing backlash against disco made it necessary to move in a different musical direction from the discoheavy off the wall27 jones and jackson were determined to make a rock song that would appeal to all tastes and spent weeks looking for a suitable guitarist for the song beat it eventually they found steve lukather of toto to play the rhythmguitar parts and eddie van halen of the rock band van halen to play the solo2325 when rod temperton wrote the song thriller he originally wanted to call it starlight or midnight man but settled on thriller because he felt the name had merchandising potential25 always wanting a notable person to recite the closing lyrics jones brought in actor vincent price who was an acquaintance of jones wife who completed his part in two takes temperton wrote the spoken portion in a taxi on the way to the recording studio jones and temperton said that some recordings were left off the final cut because they did not have the edginess of other album tracks23 songs recorded by jackson for consideration included carousel written by michael sembello got the hots written by michael jackson and quincy jones nite line written by glen ballard trouble aka shes trouble written by terry britten bill livsey and sue shifrin and hot street written by rod temperton and aka slapstick jackson also cut a version of starlight demos of all these songs exist and have leaked onto the internet carousel got the hots and hot street were completed but left off the final version of the album a short clip of carousel appeared as a bonus track on the 2001 reissue of the album the full version was later released on itunes in 2013 as part of the ultimate fan extras collection music and lyricsedit thriller excerpt of the albums title track and one of jacksons signature pieces thriller released as a single in 1984 jackson uses cinematic sound effects horror film motifs and vocal trickery to convey a sense of danger28 human nature human nature a top ten hit single in the us it is the most notable ballad on the album praised for its moody introspective lyrics and sound billie jean billie jean a number one hit single in many countries the song was written and coproduced by jackson the track mixed uptempo funk and disco with the somber themes of paranoia and obsession29 problems playing these files see media help thriller explores different music genres including pop postdisco rock and funk303132 according to steve huey of allmusic it refined the strengths of jacksons previous album off the wall the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful33 the album includes the ballads the lady in my life human nature and the girl is mine the funk pieces billie jean and wanna be startin somethin and the disco set baby be mine and pyt pretty young thing29303334 and has a similar sound to the material on off the wall wanna be startin somethin is accompanied by a bass and percussion background and the songs centerpiece a climaxing africaninspired chant often misidentified as swahili but actually syllables based on duala35 gave the song an international flavor36 the girl is mine tells of two friends fight over a woman arguing over who loves her more and concludes with a spoken rap2536 the albums songs have a tempo ranging from 80 beats per minute on the girl is mine to 138 on beat it37 despite the light pop flavor of these two records thriller more so than off the wall displayed foreshadowings of the contradictory thematic elements that would come to characterize jacksons subsequent works38 with thriller jackson would begin his association with the subliminal motif of paranoia and darker themes including supernatural imagery in the albums title track29 this is evident on the songs billie jean wanna be startin somethin and thriller30 in billie jean jackson sings about an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered a child of hers in wanna be startin somethin he argues against gossips and the media2933 in the former song jones had jackson sing vocal overdubs through a sixfootlong cardboard tube and brought in jazz saxophonist tom scott to play a rare instrument the lyricon a windcontrolled analog synthesizer bassist louis johnson ran through his part on a yamaha bass guitar the song opens with a long bassanddrums introduction39 in the song thriller sound effects such as creaking door thunder feet walking on wooden planks winds and howling dogs can be heard25 the antigangviolence beat it became a homage to west side story and was jacksons first successful rock crossover piece3340 jackson later said of beat it the point is no one has to be the tough guy you can walk away from a fight and still be a man you dont have to die to prove youre a man36 human nature cowritten by steve porcaro of the band toto41 is moody and introspective as conveyed in lyrics such as looking out across the morning the citys heart begins to beat reaching out i touch her shoulder im dreaming of the street36 by the late 1970s jacksons abilities as a vocalist were well regarded allmusic described him as a blindingly gifted vocalist13 rolling stone critic stephen holden likened his vocals to the breathless dreamy stutter of stevie wonder and wrote that jacksons featherytimbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful it slides smoothly into a startling falsetto thats used very daringly14 with the release of thriller jackson could sing low—down to a basso low c—but he preferred to sing higher because pop tenors have more range to create style42 rolling stone critic christopher connely wrote that jackson was now singing in a fully adult voice that was tinged by sadness29 pyt pretty young thing credited to james ingram and quincy jones and the lady in my life by rod temperton both gave the album a stronger rb direction the latter song was described as the closest jackson has come to crooning a sexy soulful ballad after his motown years by j randy taraborrelli36 the singer had already adopted a vocal hiccup first used in 1973 on its too late to change the time43 which he continued to implement in thriller the purpose of the hiccup—somewhat like a gulping for air or gasping—is to help invoke a certain emotion be it excitement sadness or fear44 release and receptionedit professional ratings review scores source rating allmusic 30 christgaus record guide a45 encyclopedia of popular music 46 entertainment weekly a47 musichound rb 5548 q 49 rolling stone 29 the rolling stone album guide 50 slant magazine 34 the village voice a–51 thriller was released on november 30 1982 and sold one million copies worldwide per week at its peak42 seven singles were released from the album beginning with the girl is mine the duet with paul mccartney which was criticized at the time as a poor choice for the lead release and led some critics to believe that the album would be a disappointment and to suggestions that jackson was bowing to a white audience36 the girl is mine was followed by the hit single billie jean which made thriller a charttopper5253 success continued with the single beat it which featured guitarists eddie van halen and steve lukather54 the albums title track was released as a single and also became a hit internationally36 the cover for thriller features jackson in a white suit that belonged to photographer dick zimmerman the gatefold sleeve reveals a tiger cub at jacksons leg which zimmerman reported the singer mostly kept away from his face fearing he would be scratched55 another picture from the shoot with jackson embracing the cub was used for the 2001 special edition of thriller56 in a contemporary review for rolling stone christopher connelly called thriller a zesty lp with a harrowing dark message he compared the songs on the album with the life challenges that the 24yearold jackson had faced since off the wall while observing that he dropped the boyish falsetto and was facing his challenges headon with a feisty determination and a full adult voice29 john rockwell wrote in the new york times that perhaps jackson was a sometimes too practiced performer that at times quincy jones may depersonalize his individuality with his slightly anonymous production and that jackson may be hiding his true emotions behind layers of impenetrable gauzy veils he nonetheless deemed thriller a wonderful pop record the latest statement by one of the great singers in popular music today and that there are hits here too lots of them rockwell believed it helped breach the destructive barriers that spring up regularly between white and black music especially as white publications and radio stations that normally avoid black music seem willing to pretend he isnt black after all57 in the village voice robert christgau said this is virtually a hitsplusfiller job but at such a high level its almost classic anyway51 he later wrote in retrospect what we couldnt know is how brilliantly every hit but pyt would thrive on mass exposure and public pleasure45 a year after the albums release time summed up the three main singles from the album saying the pulse of america and much of the rest of the world moves irregularly beating in time to the tough strut of billie jean the asphalt aria of beat it the supremely cool chills of thriller42 in 1989 toronto star music critics reflected on the albums they had reviewed in the past ten years in order to create a list judging them on the basis of commercial impact to social import to strictly musical merit thriller was placed at number 1 on the list where it was referred to as his master work and that commercial success has since overshadowed jacksons artistic accomplishments on thriller and thats a pity it was a record for the times brimming with breathless anticipation and a dread fear of the adult world a brilliant fantasy that pumped with sexual heat yet made room for serious reflection58 the album won a recordbreaking eight grammy awards in 1984 including album of the year jackson won seven of the grammys for the album while the eighth grammy went to bruce swedien596061 that same year jackson won eight american music awards the special award of merit and three mtv video music awards62 thriller was recognized as the worlds bestselling album on february 7 1984 when it was inducted into the guinness book of world records63 it is one of four albums to be the bestseller of two years 1983–1984 in the us64 on december 16 2015 thriller was certified 30× platinum by the recording industry association of america for shipments of at least 30 million units in the us6566 after the inclusion of streaming and tracks sales into the riaa album awards in 2017 thriller was recertified 33× platinum for a total of 33 million albumequivalent units9 the album topped the charts in many countries sold 42 million copies in the uk67 25 million in japan68 and was certified 15× platinum in australia69 still popular today thriller sells an estimated 130000 copies in the us per year it reached number two in the us catalog charts in february 2003 and number 39 in the uk in march 200762 influence and legacyedit music industryedit thriller platinum record on display at the hard rock cafe hollywood in universal city california blender described jackson as the late 20th centurys preeminent pop icon while the new york times gave the opinion that he was a musical phenomenon and that in the world of pop music there is michael jackson and there is everybody else3970 jackson changed the way the industry functioned both as an artistic persona and as a financial profitable entity his attorney john branca observed that jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point approximately 2 us461 in 2016 dollars21 for each album sold as a result jackson earned recordbreaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary the making of michael jacksons thriller produced by jackson and john landis funded by mtv the film sold over 350000 copies in its first few months in a market then driven by singles thriller raised the significance of albums yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album33 the era saw the arrival of novelties like the michael jackson doll that appeared in stores in may 1984 at a price of 12 us28 in 2016 dollars2142 thriller retains a position in american culture biographer j randy taraborrelli explains at some point thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine a toy tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple71 at the time of the albums release a press statement from gil friesen the then president of am records read that the whole industry has a stake in this success42 time magazine speculated that the fallout from thriller has given the music business its best years since the heady days of 1978 when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of 41 billion42 time summed up thrillers impact as a restoration of confidence for an industry bordering on the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop the publication described jacksons influence at that point as star of records radio rock video a oneman rescue team for the music business a songwriter who sets the beat for a decade a dancer with the fanciest feet on the street a singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too42 when thriller and billie jean were searching to reach their market demographic mtv and cable tv had a smaller market share than the much larger reach of broadcast television stations in the united states a national broadcast tv audience on abc nbc and cbs affiliate stations as well as major independent tv stations was desired by cbsepic records to promote thriller the national broadcast tv premiere of the thriller albums first video billie jean was during the week of halloween in october 1984 and was the idea of video concert hall executive producers charles henderson and jerry crowe7273 video concert hall the first nationwide music video tv network taped the onehour special in hollywood and atlanta where the tv studios of video concert hall were located74757677 the thriller tv special was hosted by thriller video costar vincent price distributed by hendersoncrowe syndications inc and aired in the top 20 tv markets and much of the united states including tv stations wnew new york wfld chicago kttv los angeles wplg miami wqtv boston and wxia atlanta for a total of 150 tv stations7273 from the moment thriller was released it set the standard for the music industry artists record labels producers marketers and even choreographers the music video was ahead of its time and it is considered a monumental one—not only in jacksons career but also in the history of pop music epic records approach to creating a song and video that would appeal to the mass market ended up influencing the way that professionals now market and release their songs78 john landiss production of a minimovie rather than the usual short music video would raise the bar for other directors and producers79 music videos and racial equalityedit thrillers music videos and singles—including the paul mccartney duet the girl is mine—are credited with helping promote racial equality in the united states before the success of thriller many felt jackson had struggled to get mtv airing because he was black39 in an effort to attain air time for jackson cbs records president walter yetnikoff pressured mtv and declared im not going to give you any more videos and im going to go public and fucking tell them about the fact you dont want to play music by a black guy39 his position persuaded mtv to begin airing billie jean and later beat it along with princes little red corvette which led to a long partnership and later helped other black music artists to gain mainstream recognition80 mtv denies claims of racism in their broadcasting81 the popularity of his videos such as beat it and billie jean helped to place the young channel on the map and mtvs focus shifted in favor of pop and rb8082 jackson transformed the medium of music video into an art form and promotional tool through the use of complex story lines dance routines special effects and cameo appearances by well known personalities33 when the 14minutelong thriller video aired mtv ran it twice an hour to meet demand83 the short film marked an increase in scale for music videos and has been routinely named the best music video ever33 the popularity of the video sent the album back to number one in the album chart but jacksons label did not support the release of the third music video from the album they were already pleased with its success so jackson convinced mtv to fund the project2583 author music critic and journalist nelson george wrote in 2004 its difficult to hear the songs from thriller and disengage them from the videos for most of us the images define the songs in fact it could be argued that michael is the first artist of the mtv age to have an entire album so intimately connected in the public imagination with its imagery28 short films like thriller largely remained unique to jackson while the group dance sequence in beat it has been frequently imitated23 the choreography in thriller has become a part of global pop culture replicated everywhere from bollywood to prisons in the philippines8485 for a black artist in the 1980s to that point jacksons success was unprecedented according to the washington post thriller paved the way for other africanamerican artists to achieve mainstream recognition such as prince86 christgau credited the girl is mine for giving radio exposure to the idea of interracial love45 time noted jackson is the biggest thing since the beatles he is the hottest single phenomenon since elvis presley he just may be the most popular black singer ever42 contemporary appealedit today thriller is still viewed in a positive light by critics some three decades later stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic wrote that the record had something to interest everyone he believed it showcased harder funk and hard rock while remaining undeniably fun he went on to compliment billie jean and wanna be startin somethin and said the records two best songs billie jean and the delirious wanna be startin somethin the freshest funk on the album but the most claustrophobic scariest track jackson ever recorded erlewine gave the opinion that it was an improvement on the artists previous album although he was critical of the title track describing it as ridiculous and as having the effect of arriving in the middle of the record and sucking out its momentum30 in the new rolling stone album guide 2004 jon pareles commented that jackson doubled his ambitions and multiplied his audience with the album and wrote of its legacy thriller had extramusical help in becoming the bestselling noncompilation album of all time jacksons dancing feet and dazzling stage presence amplified by the newfound promotional reach of music video and the reagan eras embrace of glossy celebrity but especially in the albums seven hit singles out of nine songs the music stands on its own87 sputnikmusic reviewer tyler fisher noted that thriller stands one of jacksons greatest efforts giving him an eternal legacy in pop music88 culture critic nelson george wrote that jackson has educated r kelly usher justin timberlake and countless others with thriller as a textbook89 as a sign of the albums longevity in 2003 thriller was ranked at number 20 on the rolling stone 500 greatest albums of all time list and was listed by the national association of recording merchandisers at number three of the definitive 200 albums of all time1290 in 2008 25 years after its release the record was inducted into the grammy hall of fame and a few weeks later was among 25 recordings preserved by the library of congress to the national recording registry as culturally significant9192 in 2009 music critics for mtv base and vh1 both listed thriller as the best album released since
