international trade business process business statistics business and economics portal v t e a conglomerate also named as chaebol keireitsu or the cohong is the combination of two or more corporations engaged in entirely different businesses that fall under one corporate group usually involving a parent company and many subsidiaries often a conglomerate is a multiindustry company conglomerates are often large and multinational conglomerates were popular in the 1960s due to a combination of low interest rates and a repeating bearbull market which allowed the conglomerates to buy companies in leveraged buyouts sometimes at temporarily deflated values famous examples from the 1960s include lingtemcovought1 itt corporation1 litton industries1 textron1 teledyne1 because of low interest on the loans the overall return on investment of the conglomerate appeared to grow also the conglomerate had a better ability to borrow in the money market or capital market than the smaller firm at their community bankcitation needed for many years this was enough to make the companys stock price rise as companies were often valued largely on their return on investment the aggressive nature of the conglomerators themselves was enough to make many investors who saw a powerful and seemingly unstoppable force in business buy their stock high stock prices allowed them to raise more loans based on the value of their stock and thereby buy even more companies this led to a chain reaction which allowed them to grow very rapidly however all of this growth was somewhat illusory and when interest rates rose to offset inflation conglomerate profits fell investors noticed that the companies inside the conglomerate were growing no faster than before they were purchased whereas the rationale for buying a company was that synergies would provide efficiency by the late 1960s they were shunned by the market and a major selloff of their shares ensued to keep the companies going many conglomerates were forced to shed the industries they had recently purchased and by the mid1970s most had been reduced to shells2 the conglomerate fad was subsequently replaced by newer ideas like focusing on a companys core competency in other cases conglomerates are formed for genuine interests of diversification rather than manipulation of paper return on investment companies with this orientation would only make acquisitions or start new branches in other sectors when they believed this would increase profitability or stability by sharing risks flush with cash during the 1980s general electric also moved into financing and financial services which in 2005 accounted for about 45 of the companys net earnings ge formerly owned a minority interest in nbcuniversal which owns the nbc television network and several other cable networks in some ways ge is the opposite of the typical 1960s conglomerate in that the company was not highly leveraged and when interest rates went up they were able to turn this to their advantage it was often less expensive to lease from ge than buy new equipment using loans united technologies has also proven to be a successful conglomerate with the spread of mutual funds especially index funds since 1976 investors could more easily obtain diversification by owning a small slice of many companies in a fund rather than owning shares in a conglomerate another example of a successful conglomerate is warren buffetts berkshire hathaway a holding company which used surplus capital from its insurance subsidiaries to invest in a variety of manufacturing and service businesses contents 1 international 2 advantages and disadvantages of conglomerates 21 advantages 22 disadvantages 3 media conglomerates 31 internet conglomerates 4 food conglomerates 5

section contains a pro and con list which is sometimes inappropriate please help improve it by integrating both sides into a more neutral presentation or remove this template if you feel that such a list is appropriate for this article march 2017 advantagesedit diversification results in a reduction of investment risk a downturn suffered by one subsidiary for instance can be counterbalanced by stability or even expansion in another division for example if berkshire hathaways construction materials business has a good year the profit might be offset by a bad year in its insurance business this advantage is enhanced by the fact that the business cycle affects industries in different ways financial conglomerates have very different compliance requirements from insurance or reinsurance solo entities or groups there are very important opportunities that can be exploited to increase shareholder value a conglomerate creates an internal capital market if the external one is not developed enough through the internal market different parts of conglomerate allocate capital more effectively a conglomerate can show earnings growth by acquiring companies whose shares are more discounted than its own in fact teledyne ge and berkshire hathaway have delivered high earnings growth for a time4 disadvantagesedit the extra layers of management increase costs5 accounting disclosure is less useful information many numbers are disclosed grouped rather than separately for each business the complexity of a conglomerates accounts make them harder for managers investors and regulators to analyze and makes it easier for management to hide things conglomerates can trade at a discount to the overall individual value of their businesses because investors can achieve diversification on their own simply by purchasing multiple stocks the whole is often worth less than the sum of its parts culture clashes can destroy value67 inertia prevents development of innovation8 lack of focus and inability to manage unrelated businesses equally well9 brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment product area or quality price or cachet too big to fail some cite the decreased cost of conglomerate stock a phenomenon known as conglomerate discount as evidential of these disadvantages while other traders believe this tendency to be a market inefficiency which undervalues the true strength of these stocks10 media conglomeratesedit further information media conglomerate and concentration of media ownership in her 1999 book no logo naomi klein provides several examples of mergers and acquisitions between media companies designed to create conglomerates for the purposes of creating synergy between them time warner included several tenuously linked businesses during the 1990s and 2000s including internet access content film cable systems and television their diverse portfolio of assets allowed for crosspromotion and economies of scale however the company has sold or spun off many of these businesses – including warner music group warner books aol time warner cable and time inc – since 2004 clear channel communications a public company at one point owned a variety of tv and radio stations and billboard operations together with a large number of concert venues across the us and a diverse portfolio of assets in the uk and other countries around the world the concentration of bargaining power in this one entity allowed it to gain better deals for all of its business units for example the promise of playlisting allegedly sometimes coupled with the threat of blacklisting on its radio stations was used to secure better deals from artists performing in events organized by the entertainment division these policies have been attacked as unfair and even monopolistic but are a clear advantage of the conglomerate strategy on december 21 2005 clear channel completed the divestiture of live nation and in 2007 the company divested their television stations to other firms some which clear channel holds a small interest in live nation owns the events and concert venues previously owned by clear channel communications quebecor media a canadian company controlling a subset of tv and radio stations print magazines and newspaper software company and a 4play telecom company impact of conglomerates on the media the six major media conglomerates in the united states are the walt disney company general electric news corporation viacom time warner and cbs the walt disney company is linked with abc television group creating the largest media corporation with revenue equal roughly thirty six billion dollars since walt disney owns abc it directly controls what shows and news is shown general electric owns nbc and does not allow any negative reporting against general electric on air viacom’s chief executive sumner redstone considers himself a “liberal democrat” and most of the programs shown have a primarily liberal perspective11 media conglomerate impact on journalism it leads to opinionated journalism versus traditional journalism opinionated journalism is a journalist adding his or her ideologies on a matter on top of reporting it to the public the coverage that conglomerates have of issues especially political is not necessarily objective and fails to report both sides of an issue if not taking a neutral stance12 this is known as media bias media bias is ”the intentional or unintentional slanting of news reporting toward one side due political views or cultural beliefs of journalists producers or owners of a media outlet11” internet conglomeratesedit although a relatively new development internet conglomerates such as alphabet googles parent company13 belong to the modern media conglomerate group and play a major role within various industries such as brand management in most cases internet conglomerates consist of corporations who own several mediumsized online or hybrid onlineoffline projects in many cases newly joined corporations get higher returns on investment access to business contacts and better rates on loans from
