booklet contains many images from the history world tour and ghosts film towards the end of the booklet jackson pays respect to friends such as elizabeth taylor and elton john his family employees and fans11 the album was released by epic records on may 20 1997 history on film volume ii was released on the same day—a video collection of jacksons music videos and television performances from the history era of 1995–199712 by jacksons prior standards it was not widely promoted upon release457 the new york times described the us promotional effort as subdued creating hardly a sound and perplexing to many people in the industry jacksons label epic records refuted allegations they were not promoting the album sufficiently in the united states saying we are completely behind the albummichael is certainly one of our superstars and is treated as suchwe just went into this one with our global hats on the new york times acknowledged that promotion was stronger internationally where jackson had more commercial force and popularity jackson effectively no longer needed the us market to have a hit record by june 1997 only ten percent of sales from jacksons prior studio album came from within the united states13 the singer released a film entitled ghosts which he unveiled at the cannes film festival as part of the album promotion it was released theatrically in the united states in october 1996 as for the united kingdom it debuted at the odeon leicester square in may 1997 the uk event attracted fans media and business organizations it was released on cassette in most parts of the world4514 the film was written by jackson and stephen king and directed by stan winston the story was based loosely on the events and isolation jackson felt after he was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993 in the plot the maestro—played by jackson—is nearly chased out of his town by the residents and the mayor—who deliberately looks very similar to tom sneddon—because they believe him to be a freak the film had similar imagery and themes to that of thriller it features many special effects and dance moves choreographed to original music which jackson himself authored the film includes several songs and music videos from the albums history and blood on the dance floor history in the mix ghosts is over thirtyeight minutes long and holds the guinness world record as the worlds longest music video it won the bob fosse award for best choreography in a music video514151617 the album was also promoted with the singles blood on the dance floor and historyghosts as well as three corresponding music videos the video for blood on the dance floor premiered on top of the pops18 it centered on susie seducing jackson in a courtship dance before opening a switchblade the lead single peaked at number one in several countries including the united kingdom1419 the double aside historyghosts was promoted with a video for each song history was set in a nightclub in a futuristic era and recalled jacksons filmography ghosts was a fiveminute clip taken from the much longer film ghosts the double aside would become a top five hit in the united kingdom but did not chart as highly elsewhere1420 commercial receptionedit initial sales in the united states were seen as disappointing for jackson it peaked at number 24 on the us billboard 200 chart and after four weeks the record had sold 92000 copies despite this long term sales were stronger it was certified platinum in may 2000 for shipments of at least a million units21 it was certified gold in canada for a minimum of 50000 shipments22 in europe the record has been certified for shipments of at least two million copies23 blood on the dance floor history in the mix debuted atop the uk album chart by july 1997 it had sold 250000 units in the united kingdom and 445000 units in germany513 the album also peaked at number one in france belgium spain and new zealand1324 since its debut the album has sold an estimated six million copies worldwide making it the best selling remix album ever released25 critical responseedit professional ratings review scores source rating allmusic 26 entertainment weekly c−27 new york daily news negative28 the atlanta journal and the atlanta constitution d29 the new york times positive30 the virginianpilot positive31 rolling stone 32 jim farber of new york daily news labeled the albums theme predatory women jealous underlings and the evil media continue to obsess him hes once again playing victim—the worlds most powerless billionaire it seems—mewling about forces conspiring against his heavenly self he said of the lead single jackson coughs up a series of strangulated mutters and munchkin hiccups in lieu of a vocal while its chilly fauxindustrial music proves as appealing as a migraine he continued ghosts and is it scary boast a few innovative sounds but no real melodies33 thor christensen of the dallas morning news noted the album focused on angry tales about a coldhearted superfly sister or the backstabbing women in ghosts and blood on the dance floor three of the five new songs on this remix albuminvolve mean psychotic exlovers he observed the dark cryptic morphine is easily one of the most ambitious songs hes ever recorded he fuels the song with narcotic industrial funk—look out trent reznor—but then dilutes it by sticking in 90 seconds of goopy stringladen balladry1 neil strauss of the new york times gave the album a positive review saying the record put mr jackson halfway on the road to a very interesting concept album there is real pain and pathos in these new songshe frets about painkillers sexual promiscuity and public image in many of them mr jackson seems like the elephant man screaming that he is a human beingwith beats crashing like metal sheets and synthesizer sounds hissing like pressurized gas this is industrial funk he favorably compared jacksons performance of is it scary to rock singer marilyn manson and noted the lyrics if you want to see eccentric oddities ill be grotesque before your eyes strauss suggested that the predatory woman susie from the title track was a metaphor for aids finally he described morphine as chilling mr jackson sings seductively from the point of view of the drug itselfhe intones sweetly 34 roger catlin of the hartford courant stated the most intriguing pairing is ghosts and is it scary in which he asks those whove only read about him in tabloids if he seems monstrous35 the cincinnati post described the lead single as a lackluster first releasedated playedout dance track but gave the album an overall favorable analysis the review described ghosts and is it scary as classic jackson paranoia anthony violenti of the buffalo news said of the lead single it is laced with teddy rileys new jack swing sound and a pounding techno beat violenti added superfly sister ghosts and is it scary are programmed plastic soul that makes you wonder how someone as talented as jackson can churn out such tracks he said of morphine it has more synthesized beats and quickly fades into jacksons current indistinguishable style2 william ruhlman of allmusic said of the lead track blood on the dance floor is an uptempo jackson song in the increasingly hysterical tradition of billie jean and smooth criminal with jackson huffing puffing and yelping through some nonsense about a stabbingover a fairly generic electronic dance track36 stephen thomas erlewine also of allmusic had a negative reaction to the record he said that all five new tracks were embarrassingly weak sounding tired predictable and well bloodless he described blood on the dance floor as a bleak reworking of jam and scream37 chris dickinson of st louis postdispatch noted superfly sister comes on like a classic michael dance track with michael and bryan loren playing all the instrumentsblood on the dance floor album is definitely a dance record its not thriller or bad or even off the wall and its not trying to be38 jaeha kim of chicago suntimes noted is it scary shows a darker side of jackson than even the tabloids would have you believewith the hypnotic morphine he sounds like a seductive cousin of trent reznors39 sonia murray of the atlanta journal and the atlanta constitution gave the album a d grade she claimed that ghosts pounds with funk until jacksons weak vocals come in she described morphine as an overblown rock hiss29 the virginianpilot gave the album a positive review also expressing the opinion that morphine sounded eerily like state of shock and continued scream louder a remix of his hit duet with sister janet is better than the original only because it takes away the overpowering guitar twangs40 the washington post described superfly sister as sex funk adding morphine apparently told from the drugs point of view and featuring both the andrae crouch singers and an orchestra alternates between hardedged rock and operatic pop41 contemporary viewedit a longtime commentator on jacksons public life j randy taraborrelli gave a retrospective analysis of the album in the biography the magic the madness taraborrelli explained michaels 1997 album containedkickass dance remixesseveral of the other songs on blood are also memorable ghosts stands out perhaps because its so evocative of michaels spellbinding ghosts longstyled videoits classic mustsee michael jacksonthe collection was not a success in america it was dismissed by critics and much of his audience who seemed confused as to whether it was a new release or some kind of hybrid combination of songs he expressed the opinion that the project was a major hit in the united kingdom tabarorrelli said that blood on the dance floor was one of jacksons best songs a song that us fans dont even know exists the reporter concluded that the us public were more interested in the controversial tabloid stories about his personal life15 william ruhlman of allmusic agreed that part of the blame for a perceived commercial disappointment in the united states could be attributed to the ongoing public interest in the singers private life nonetheless ruhlman still felt the album was artistically disappointing36 in 2005 j t griffith of allmusic believed that in hindsight blood on the dance floor was actually a good song he explained it is a secondrate mixture of beat it and thriller but jacksons missteps are better than most pop music out there this track showcases all the artists trademarks the ooohing the grunts and funky basslines it is hard to hear blood on the dance floor and not want to moonwalk or dance like a ghoul42 track listingedit no title writers length 1 blood on the dance floor michael jackson teddy riley 413 2 morphine guitar performance by slash
