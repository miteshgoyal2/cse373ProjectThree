creating software and to improve the quality of the delivered product software applicationsedit software engineers build software applications operating systems system software that people use applications influence software engineering by pressuring developers to solve problems in new ways for example consumer software emphasizes low cost medical software emphasizes high quality and internet commerce software emphasizes rapid development business software accounting software analytics data mining closely related to database decision support systems airline reservations banking

cryptography databases support almost every field embedded systems both software engineers and traditional engineers write software control systems for embedded products automotive software avionics software heating ventilating and air conditioning hvac software medical device software telephony telemetry engineering all traditional engineering branches use software extensively engineers use spreadsheets more than they ever used calculators engineers use custom software tools to design analyze and simulate their own projects like bridges and power lines these projects resemble software in many respects because the work exists as electronic documents and goes through analysis design implementation and testing phases software tools for engineers use the tenets of computer science as well
