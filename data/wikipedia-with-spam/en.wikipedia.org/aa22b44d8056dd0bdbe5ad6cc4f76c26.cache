february 8 2008 conservative radio host rush limbaugh mentioned on his syndicated show that jindal could be a possible choice for the republican vice presidential nomination in 2008 he said that jindal might be perceived as an asset to john mccains campaign because he has wide support in the conservative and moderate wings of the republican party and his immigrant past offsets mccains white heritage if mccain had won the presidency he would have been the oldest president ever inaugurated to a first term85 heightening the speculation mccain invited jindal gov charlie crist of florida gov tim pawlenty of minnesota and mccains former rivals mitt romney and mike huckabee to meet at mccains home in arizona on may 23 2008 according to a republican familiar with the decision romney huckabee and pawlenty all of whom were already well acquainted with mccain declined because of prior commitments86 the meeting may have served a different purpose such as consideration of jindal for the opportunity to speak at the 2008 republican national convention in a similar fashion to barack obama at the 2004 democratic national convention cementing a place for him in the party and opening the gate for a future run for the presidency87 speculation was fueled by simultaneous july 21 2008 reports that mccain was making a sudden visit to louisiana to confer again with jindal and that mccain was readying to name his running mate within a week however on july 23 2008 jindal said that he would not be the republican vice presidential nominee in 200888 jindal added that he never talked to the

some members of both the democratic and the republican parties referring to jindal as devoid of substantive ideas for governing the country political commentator rachel maddow summarized jindals katrina remark as follows jindal states that since government failed during hurricane katrina we should understand not that government should not be allowed to fail again but that governmentnever works that government cant work and therefore we should stop seeking a functioning government93 david johnson a republican political strategist criticized jindals mention of hurricane katrina stating the one thing republicans want to forget is katrina94 while jindals speech was poorly received by several democratic and republican critics others argued that the speech should be judged on substance rather than delivery style9596 jindals story of meeting lee in the immediate aftermath of hurricane katrina was questioned following the speech as jindal was not in new orleans at the time97 on
