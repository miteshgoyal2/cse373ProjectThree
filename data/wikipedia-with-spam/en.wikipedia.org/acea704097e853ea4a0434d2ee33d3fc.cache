a naval task force in combat19 while serving in afghanistan as a brigadier general he was known as an officer who engaged his men with real leadership a young marine officer named nathaniel fick cited an example of that leadership when he witnessed mattis in a fighting hole talking with a sergeant and lance corporal no one would have questioned mattis if hed slept eight hours each night in a private room to be woken each morning by an aide who ironed his uniforms and heated his mres but there he was in the middle of a freezing night out on the lines with his marines30 iraq waredit letter written by mattis on the eve of the 2003 invasion of iraq addressed to members of the 1st marine division as a major general mattis commanded the 1st marine division during the 2003 invasion of iraq

deliberate on whether or not to bomb the location describing the wedding as implausible he said how many people go to the middle of the desert to hold a wedding 80 miles 130km from the nearest civilization these were more than two dozen militaryage males lets not be naive32 the associated press obtained video footage appearing to show a wedding party although the occurrence of a wedding was disputed by military officials33 following a department of defense survey that showed only 55 of american soldiers and 40 of marines would report a colleague for abusing civilians mattis told marines in may 2007 that whenever you show anger or disgust toward civilians its a victory for alqaeda and other insurgents reflecting an understanding of the need for restraint in war as key to defeating an insurgency he added that every time you wave at an iraqi civilian alqaeda rolls over in its grave34 a city street in fallujah heavily damaged by the fighting november 2004 mattis popularized the 1st marine divisions motto no better friend no worse enemy a paraphrase of the famous selfmade epitaph for the roman dictator lucius cornelius sulla35 in his open letter to all men within the division for

unable or unwilling to relieve underperforming or incompetent officers during the divisions push to baghdad mattis relieved colonel joe d dowdy commander of regimental combat team1 it was such a rare occurrence in the modern military that it made the front page of newspapers despite this mattis declined to comment on the matter publicly other than to say that the practice of officer relief remains alive or at least we are doing it in the marines30 later interviews of dowdys officers and men revealed that the colonel was doomed partly by an ageold wartime tension men versus mission—in which he favored his men while mattis insisted on execution of the mission to seize baghdad swiftly42 combat development commandedit after being promoted to lieutenant general mattis took command of marine
