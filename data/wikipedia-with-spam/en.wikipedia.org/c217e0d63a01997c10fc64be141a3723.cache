usersubmitted travel times and route details while downloading locationdependent information over a mobile telephone network waze describes its app as a communitydriven gps navigation app which is free to download and use the app was first developed and popularized by waze mobile an israeli company founded by ehud shabtai amir shinar and uri levine funded by two israeli venture capital firms magma and vertex and an earlystage american venture capital firm bluerun ventures waze mobile was acquired in 2013 by google waze won the best overall app award at the 2013 mobile world congress beating dropbox flipboard and others1 waze supports android and iphone while symbian blackberry 10 except blackberry q102 windows phone 83 and windows mobile from version 5 4 were deprecated in july 2013 waze said they planned to support both iphone and android and would consider supporting new platforms as older platforms symbian wm blackberry do not support either a full native ui or other application programming interfaces they rely on they claimed they could not support them any more although existing versions would continue to work5 currently only 13 countries have a full base map the others are incompletely mapped as of 2013update waze has a complete base map for the united states philippines canada united kingdom france germany italy netherlands belgium israel claimed to be the best map for that country6 south africa7 colombia ecuador chile and panama but the company has plans to complete maps for other countries in europe and elsewhere89 contents 1 overview 2 interaction with government 3 criticism 4 patents and licensing 5 history 51 development 52 acquisition by google 6 crowdsourcing 7 see also 8 references 9 external links overviewedit the waze app with visible users traffic volume and noted redlight cameras waze collects map data travel times and traffic information from users and transmits it to the waze server at no cost to waze10 waze users or wazers can report accidents traffic jams speed and police traps and from the online map editor can update roads landmarks house numbers etc waze sends anonymous information including users speed and location back to its database to improve the service as a whole based on the information collected waze is then in a position to provide routing and realtime traffic updates waze can also identify the cheapest fuel station near a user or along their route provided waze has enabled fuel prices for that country waze can be used anywhere in the world but requires enough initial users to create the maps and continuously update data to make it useful currently only 13 countries have a full base map the others are incompletely mapped requiring users to record roads and edit maps waze offers turnbyturn voice navigation realtime traffic and other locationspecific alerts waze encourages users to report traffic or road hazards by offering points11 addons expand the functions and personalize this interaction with the app for example addons can integrate foursquare and facebook friends to waze or notify the user when driving through a highcrime area12 interaction with governmentedit waze invented and initiated the connected citizens program ccp a free data sharing program used by over 200 governments departments of transportation and municipalities for traffic analysis road planning and emergency work force dispatching13 waze both contributes to government data and also collects government data to use in 2014 rio de janeiro started collecting data for its traffic management system rio collects realtime data both from drivers who use the waze navigation app and pedestrians who use the publictransportation app moovit rio was also talking to the owners of cycling app strava to monitor movements of cyclists it was noted that though initially the data the apps were sharing was all anonymous more specific identifying details were possible if people agreed to being monitored through their smartphones if they saw benefits for them14 criticismedit concerns have been expressed that the app located on smartphones can be used to monitor movements by identifiable individuals14 some roadsafety advocates have voiced concern over the prospect of more drivers using waze which they say has the potential to distract them with a flurry of icons and notifications and put them at greater risk of an accident15 in march 2014 a successful attempt was made by students from technionisrael institute of technology to fake a traffic jam16 in december 2014 in a letter sent to google los angeles police department chief charlie beck complained about the police locator feature claiming it could be misused by those with criminal intent to endanger police officers and the community it was alleged that ismaaiyl brinsley who shot and killed two nypd officers that month in retaliation for the police killings of eric garner and michael brown had used the waze app prior to the murders and had posted a screenshot from the app on his instagram account hours before the shootings17 users are able to mark the presence of an officer with a small icon and indicate if the officer is visible or hidden the lapd among other police agencies pressured google to disable the feature on the application google states that knowing the whereabouts of an officer promotes safer driving1819 patents and licensingedit waze mobile ltd holds several patents including us patent 7936284 system and method for parking time estimations issued may 3 2011 us patent 8271057 conditionbased activation shutdown and management of applications of mobile devices issued september 18 2012 us patent 8612136 system and method for road map creation issued december 17 2013 with priority date of august 27 2008 this patent was mentioned in the class action suit filed in 2014 the waze v2x software was distributed under gnu general public license v2 which did not extend to map data20 freemap21 data was not published under open content licenses even before the shift to waze project ehud shabtai who initiated and developed freemap and waze continuously insisted to crowdsource data without using external sources or projects like openstreetmap that would restrict commercialization of the waze map data22 starting with waze v3 the application was rewritten and as such switched to a proprietary license23 the last open source client version for the iphone and android is 2400 and for windows mobile 202425 a class action suit was filed in march 2014 by accountant roey gorodish against waze claiming intellectual property violation for the use of opensource freemap map and code from the opensource roadmap software26 a project that ehud shabtai had contributed for the windows pocketpc version in 2006272829 the lawsuit was dismissed on march 5 2017 with a clear cut decision that there was no basis for a class action suit in this case historyedit developmentedit in 2006 freemap israel was a project founded and developed by ehud shabtai as a community project which aimed to create with the crowd sourcing assistance of community users a free digital database of the map of israel in hebrew and to ensure its free content update and distribution30 in 2008 shabtai formed a company called waze to commercialize the project31 the company name was changed to waze mobile ltd in 2009 in december 2011 waze employed 80 people composed of 70 at raanana israel and 10 in palo alto california32333435 in 2010 the company raised 25 million in the second round of funding36 in 2011 the company which planned to monetize through locationbased advertising and to expand into asia raised an additional 30 million in financing37 in 2011 the app was updated to display realtime communitycurated points of interest including local events such as street fairs and protests38 as of january 2012update the app had been downloaded 12 million times worldwide3739 in july 2012 waze announced that it had reached 20 million users half of them recruited in the previous six months40 according to yahoo there were nearly 50 million waze users as of june 201341 in june 2012 waze launched an update to provide realtime fuel prices as with all waze realtime updates prices are submitted by users however this feature is not available in all countries42 since november 2012 in monetizing its app waze has offered resellers and advertisers a web interface to advertise based on location where a small icon appears when a phone is at a particular location prompting the user to engage43 it also offers to tv news stations a web interface to broadcast current traffic reports and alerts directly from the waze app the service had been used by 25 tv us news stations by june 201344 it has also been used in rio de janeiro inside centro de operações rio rios operations center since july 24 201345 as well as in new york and new jersey since 2012 in june 2013 waze introduced a global localization project that enables future road closures and realtime traffic updates during major events in a given country for example tour de france46 in march 2017 spotify announced its partnership with waze to give an integrated experience where wazers could play music on spotify directly from waze app and get waze directions on spotify app on the android platform six months later the feature was made available on the ios platform 47 48 acquisition by googleedit according to rumors facebook and other companies were interested in purchasing waze but did not reach an agreement495051 in june 2013 google bought waze for a reported 13 billion adding social data to its mapping business5253 it was later revealed that the price was actually us966 million as part of the deal each of wazes 100 employees was to receive an average of about 12 million the largest payout to employees in the history of israeli high tech54 in june 2013 the united states federal trade commission started considering whether googles purchase of waze might violate competition law55 – waze was one of very few competitors in the mobile mapping sector to googles own google maps the ftc decided that it would not challenge googles acquisition of waze56 the uk office of fair trading and the israel antitrust authority also investigated it and allowed the acquisition575859 following the acquisition of waze google submitted a 10q filing with the securities exchange commission sec that revealed that the corporation spent 13 billion on acquisitions during the first half of 2013 but that the waze acquisition cost google 966 million instead of the 11 billion figure that was initially presented in media sources606162 crowdsourcingedit one of the unique aspects of waze is the ability to direct users based on crowdsourced information waze users are able to report a multitude of traffic related incidents from accidents to police traps this data is used by waze to help other users either by alerting them of the condition ahead or even rerouting the user to avoid the area entirely in addition to user input waze also relies on information from state agencies for traffic events such as road construction the idea behind this is the more people who provide data the more accurate it will be63 in addition to using crowdsourced information for traffic alerts waze also allows registered users to modify the map data itself through the waze map editor map editors are allowed to make changes to the map based on where they have driven while using waze as well as their rank which is based on how many map edits a user has made see alsoedit comparison of commercial gps software referencesedit hoffman tzahi february 27 2013 waze wins best mobile app award in barcelona
