eventually the spot was found to be scar tissue from an early bout of pneumonia1112 primary and secondary education young richard attended east whittier elementary school where he was president of his eighthgrade class13 his parents believed that attending whittier high school had caused richards older brother harold to live a dissolute lifestyle before he fell ill of tuberculosis he died of the disease in 1933 and so they sent richard to the larger fullerton union high school1415 he had to ride a school bus for an hour each way during his freshman year and he received excellent grades later

graduated from whittier high third in his class of 207 students19 collegiate and law school education nixon was offered a tuition grant to attend harvard university but harolds continued illness and

as part of that effort a pink sheet was distributed by the nixon campaign suggesting that as douglas voting record was similar to that of new york congressman vito marcantonio believed by some to be a

campaign tactics69 in the senate nixon took a prominent position in opposing global communism traveling frequently and speaking out against it70 he maintained friendly relations with his fellow

against price controls and other monetary restrictions benefits for illegal immigrants and public power72 vice presidency 1953–1961 general dwight d eisenhower was nominated for president by the

agreed to the senators selection nixons youth he was then 39 stance against communism and political base in california—one of the largest states—were all seen as votewinners by the leaders among the candidates considered along with nixon were ohio senator robert a taft new jersey governor alfred driscoll and illinois senator everett dirksen7374 on the campaign trail eisenhower spoke to his plans for the country leaving the negative campaigning to his running mate75 front cover of literature for the eisenhower–nixon campaign 1952 in midseptember the republican ticket faced a major crisis76 the media reported that nixon had a political fund maintained by his backers which reimbursed him for political expenses77 such a fund was not illegal but it exposed nixon to allegations of possible conflict of interest with pressure building for eisenhower to demand nixons resignation from the ticket the senator went on television to deliver an address to the nation on september 23 195278 the address later termed the checkers speech was heard by about 60 million americans—including the largest television audience up to that point79 nixon emotionally defended himself stating that the fund was not secret nor had donors received special favors he painted himself as a man of modest means his wife had no mink coat instead she wore a respectable republican cloth coat and a patriot78 the speech would be remembered for the gift which nixon had received but which he would not give back a little cocker spaniel dog … sent all the way from texas and our little girl—tricia the 6yearold—named it checkers78 the speech prompted a huge public outpouring of support for nixon80 eisenhower decided to retain him on the ticket81 which proved victorious in the november election75 eisenhower gave nixon responsibilities during his term as vice president—more than any previous vice president82 nixon attended cabinet and national security council meetings and chaired them when

he visited saigon and hanoi in french indochina83 on his return to the united states at the end of 1953 nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations84 biographer irwin gellman who chronicled nixons congressional years said of his vice presidency eisenhower radically altered the role of his running mate by presenting him with critical assignments in both foreign and domestic affairs once he assumed his office the vice president welcomed the presidents initiatives and worked energetically to accomplish white house objectives because of the collaboration between these two leaders nixon deserves the title the first modern vice president85 despite intense campaigning by nixon who reprised his strong attacks on the democrats the republicans lost control of both houses of congress in the 1954 elections these losses caused nixon to contemplate leaving politics once he had served out his term86 on september 24 1955 president eisenhower suffered a heart attack his condition was initially believed to be lifethreatening eisenhower was unable to perform his duties for six weeks the 25th amendment to the united states constitution had not yet been proposed and the vice president had no formal power to act nonetheless nixon acted in eisenhowers stead during this period presiding over cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and cabinet officers did not seek power87 according to nixon biographer stephen ambrose nixon had earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis  he made no attempt to seize power88 his spirits buoyed nixon sought a second term but some of eisenhowers aides aimed to displace him in a december 1955 meeting eisenhower proposed that nixon not run for reelection in order to give him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a cabinet officer in a second eisenhower administration nixon believed such an action would destroy his political career when eisenhower announced his reelection bid in february 1956 he hedged on the choice of his running mate stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated although no republican was opposing eisenhower nixon received a substantial number of writein votes against the president in the 1956 new hampshire primary election in late april the president announced that nixon would again be his running mate89 eisenhower and nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the november 1956 election90 vice president nixon and soviet premier nikita khrushchev speak as the press looks on in part

through congress the bill was weakened in the senate and civil rights leaders were divided over whether eisenhower should sign it nixon advised the president to sign the bill which he did91 eisenhower

forced back into the car by a volley of thrown objects at his hotel nixon faced another mob and one demonstrator spat on him93 in caracas venezuela nixon and his wife were spat on by antiamerican demonstrators and their limousine was attacked by a pipewielding mob94 according to ambrose nixons courageous conduct caused even some of his bitterest enemies to give him some grudging respect95 in july 1959 president eisenhower sent nixon to the soviet union for the opening of the american national exhibition in moscow on july 24 while touring the exhibits with soviet premier nikita khrushchev the two stopped at a model of an american kitchen and engaged in an impromptu exchange about the merits of capitalism versus communism that became known as the kitchen debate96 1960 and 1962 elections wilderness years main article united states presidential election 1960 1960 electoral vote results in 1960 nixon launched his first campaign for president of the united states he faced little opposition in the republican primaries97 and chose former massachusetts senator henry cabot lodge jr as his running mate98 his democratic opponent was john f kennedy and the race remained close for the duration99 nixon campaigned on his experience but kennedy called for new blood and claimed the eisenhower–nixon administration had allowed the soviet union to overtake the us in ballistic missiles the missile gap100 a new political medium was introduced in the campaign televised presidential debates in the first of four such debates nixon appeared pale with a five oclock shadow in contrast to the photogenic kennedy98 nixons performance in the debate was perceived to be mediocre in the visual medium of television though many people listening on the radio thought that nixon had won101 nixon lost the election narrowly with kennedy ahead by only 112827 votes 02 percent in the popular vote98 outgoing vice president nixon and incoming vice president lyndon johnson leave the white house on the morning of january 20 1961 for the kennedy–johnson inauguration ceremonies there were charges of vote fraud in texas and illinois both states won by kennedy nixon refused to consider contesting the election feeling a lengthy controversy would diminish the united states in the eyes of the world and the uncertainty would hurt us interests102 at the end of his term of office as vice president in january 1961 nixon and his family returned to california where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book six crises which included coverage of the hiss case eisenhowers heart attack and the fund crisis which had been resolved by the checkers speech98103 local and national republican leaders encouraged nixon to challenge incumbent pat brown for governor of california in the 1962 election98 despite initial reluctance nixon entered the race98 the campaign was clouded by public suspicion that nixon viewed the office as a steppingstone for another presidential run some opposition from the farright of the party and his own lack of interest in being californias governor98 nixon hoped that a successful run would confirm him in his status as the nations leading active republican politician and ensure he remained a major player in national politics104 instead he lost to brown by more than five percentage points and the defeat was widely believed to be the end of his political career98 in an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent saying you wont have nixon to kick around anymore because gentlemen this is my last press conference105 the california defeat was highlighted in the november 11 1962 episode of abcs howard k smith news and comment entitled the political obituary of richard m nixon106 alger hiss appeared on the program and many members of the public complained that it was unseemly to allow a convicted felon air time to attack a former vice president the furor drove smith and his program from the air107 and public sympathy for nixon grew106 nixon shows his papers to an east german officer to cross between the sectors of the divided city of berlin 1963 the nixon family traveled to

nixon mudge rose guthrie alexander98 nixon had pledged when announcing his california campaign not to run for president in 1964 even if he had not he believed it would be difficult to defeat kennedy or after his assassination kennedys successor lyndon johnson109 in 1964 he supported arizona senator barry goldwater for the republican nomination for president when goldwater was successful in gaining the nomination nixon was selected to introduce the candidate to the convention although he thought goldwater unlikely to win nixon campaigned for him loyally the election was a disaster for the republicans goldwaters landslide loss to johnson was matched by heavy losses for the party in congress and among state governors110 nixon was one of the few leading republicans not blamed for the disastrous results and he sought to build on that in the 1966 congressional elections he campaigned for many republicans seeking to regain seats lost in the johnson landslide and received credit for helping the republicans make major gains in the midterm election111 1968 presidential election main articles richard nixon presidential campaign 1968 and united states presidential election 1968 nixon

nelson rockefeller and california governor ronald reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot114 he selected maryland governor spiro agnew as his running mate a choice which nixon believed would unite the party appealing to both northern moderates and southerners disaffected with the democrats115 nixons democratic opponent in the general election was vice president hubert humphrey who was nominated at a convention marked by violent protests116 throughout the campaign nixon portrayed himself as a figure of stability during a period of national unrest and upheaval116 he appealed to what he later called the silent majority of socially conservative americans who disliked the hippie counterculture and the antiwar demonstrators agnew became an increasingly vocal critic of these groups solidifying nixons position with the right117 nixon waged a prominent television advertising campaign meeting with supporters in

analysis on the talks from henry kissinger then a consultant to us negotiator averell harriman and his campaign was in regular contact with anna chennault at a july 1968 meeting in nixons new york apartment with south vietnamese ambassador bùi diễm he had been informed that chennault would represent nixon during the campaign121 she advised south vietnamese president thieu not to go to paris to join the talks hinting that nixon would give him a better deal if elected johnson was aware of what was going on as he had both chennault and the south vietnamese ambassador to washington bugged and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by nixon to undermine us foreign policy on october 31 with no agreement johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing and that peace negotiations would start in paris on november 6 the day after election day on november 2 after speaking with chennault again thieu stated he would not go to paris johnson telephoned nixon who denied any involvement the president did not believe him johnson felt he could not publicly mention chennaults involvement which had been obtained by wiretapping but told humphrey who chose not to use the information122123 in late 2016 historian john farrell publicized notes in which haldeman wrote down nixons instructions during the campaign these notes had been provided to the nixon library by the nixon estate in 2007 in an october 22 1968 phone call with nixon haldeman wrote “any other way to monkey wrench it anything rn can do” and “keep anna chennault working on svn” south vietnam it is not clear whether the government of south vietnam needed much encouragement to opt out of a peace process they considered disadvantageous124 in a threeway race between nixon humphrey and american independent party candidate former alabama governor george wallace nixon defeated humphrey by nearly 500000 votes seventenths of a percentage point with 301 electoral votes to 191 for humphrey and 46 for wallace116125 in his victory speech nixon pledged that his administration would try to bring the divided nation together126 nixon said i have received a very gracious message from the vice president congratulating me for winning the election i congratulated him for his gallant and courageous fight against great odds i also told him that i know exactly how he felt i know how it feels to

holding the family bibles nixon was inaugurated as president on january 20 1969 sworn in by his onetime political rival chief justice earl warren pat nixon held the family bibles open at isaiah 24 which reads they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks in his inaugural address which received almost uniformly positive reviews nixon remarked that the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker128—a phrase that would later be placed on his gravestone129 he spoke about turning partisan politics into a new age of unity in these difficult years america has suffered from a fever of words from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading we cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices130 foreign policy nixon and chinese premier zhou enlai toast during nixons 1972 visit to china china main article 1972 nixon visit to china president nixon shakes hands with chinese premier zhou enlai upon arriving in beijing 1972 nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to china before he became president writing in foreign affairs a year before his election there is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation131 assisting him in this venture was his national security advisor and future secretary of state henry kissinger with whom the president worked closely bypassing cabinet officials with relations between the soviet union and china at a nadir—border clashes between the two took place during nixons first year in office—nixon sent private word to the chinese that he desired closer relations a breakthrough came in early 1971 when chairman mao invited a team of american table tennis players to visit china and play against top chinese players nixon followed up by sending kissinger to china for clandestine meetings with chinese officials131 on july 15 1971 it was simultaneously announced by beijing and by nixon on television and radio that the president would visit china the following february the announcements astounded the world132 the secrecy allowed both sets of leaders time to prepare the political climate in their countries for the contact133 in february 1972 nixon and his wife traveled to china kissinger briefed nixon for over 40 hours in preparation134 upon touching down the president and first lady emerged from air force one and greeted chinese premier zhou enlai nixon made a point of shaking zhous hand something which thensecretary of state john foster dulles had refused to do in 1954 when the two met in geneva135 over 100 television journalists accompanied the president on nixons orders television was strongly favored over printed publications as nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print it also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised135 nixon and kissinger met for an hour with mao and zhou at maos official private residence where they discussed a range of issues136 mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by nixon whom he considered forthright unlike the leftists and the soviets136 he said he was suspicious of kissinger136 though the national security advisor referred to their meeting as his encounter with history135 a formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the great hall of the people the following day nixon met with zhou the joint communique following this meeting recognized taiwan as a part of china and looked forward to a peaceful solution to the problem of reunification137 when not in meetings nixon toured architectural wonders including the forbidden city ming tombs and the great wall135 americans received their first glimpse into chinese life through the cameras which accompanied pat nixon who toured the city of beijing and visited communes schools factories and hospitals135 the visit ushered in a new era of sinoamerican relations116 fearing the possibility of a sinoamerican alliance the soviet union yielded to pressure for détente with the united states138 vietnam war main articles vietnam war vietnamization and role of the united states in the vietnam war nixon delivers an address to the nation about the cambodian incursion when nixon took office about 300 american soldiers were dying each week in vietnam139 and the war was broadly unpopular in the united states with violent protests against the war ongoing the johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions but this agreement never fully took force according to walter isaacson soon after taking office nixon had concluded that the vietnam war could not be won and he was determined to end the war quickly140 he sought some arrangement which would permit american forces to withdraw while leaving south vietnam secure against attack141 nixon approved a secret b52 carpet bombing campaign of north vietnamese and later allied khmer rouge positions in cambodia in march 1969 codenamed operation menu without the consent of cambodian leader norodom sihanouk142143144 in mid1969 nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the north vietnamese sending a personal letter to north vietnamese leaders and peace talks began in paris initial talks however did not result in an agreement145 in may 1969 he publicly proposed to withdraw all american troops from south vietnam provided north vietnam also did so and for south vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections with viet cong participation146 in july 1969 nixon visited south vietnam where he met with his us military commanders and president nguyễn văn thiệu amid protests at home demanding an immediate pullout he implemented a strategy of replacing american troops with vietnamese troops known as vietnamization116 he soon instituted phased us troop withdrawals147 but authorized incursions into laos in part to interrupt the ho chi minh trail used to supply north vietnamese forces that passed through laos and cambodia nixon announced the ground invasion of cambodia to the american public on april 30 1970148 his responses to protesters included an impromptu early morning meeting with them at the lincoln memorial on may 9 1970149150151 documents uncovered from the soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the north vietnamese attempt to overrun cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the khmer rouge and negotiated by pol pots thensecondincommand nuon chea152 nixons campaign promise to curb the war contrasted with the escalated bombing led to claims that nixon had a credibility gap on the issue147 it is estimated that between 50000 and 150000 people were killed during the bombing of cambodia between 1970 and 1973143 in 1971 excerpts from the pentagon papers which had been leaked by daniel ellsberg were published by the new york times and the washington post when news of the leak first appeared nixon was inclined to do nothing the papers a history of united states involvement in vietnam mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations he was persuaded by kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared and the president tried to prevent publication the supreme court eventually ruled for the newspapers153 as us troop withdrawals continued conscription was reduced and in 1973 ended the armed forces became allvolunteer154 after years of fighting the paris peace accords were signed at the beginning of 1973 the agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining american troops without requiring the 160000 north vietnam army regulars located in the south to withdraw155 once american combat support ended there was a brief truce before fighting broke out again north vietnam conquered south vietnam in 1975156 latin american policy see also us intervention in chile § 1973 coup nixon and mexican president gustavo díaz ordaz riding a presidential motorcade in san diego california september 1970 nixon had been a firm supporter of kennedy in the 1961 bay of pigs invasion and 1962 cuban missile crisis on taking office he stepped up covert operations against cuba and its president fidel castro he maintained close relations with the cubanamerican exile community through his friend bebe rebozo who often suggested ways of irritating castro these activities concerned the soviets and cubans who feared nixon might attack cuba and break the understanding between kennedy and khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis in august 1970 the soviets asked nixon to reaffirm the understanding despite his hard line against castro nixon agreed the process had not yet been completed when the soviets began expanding their base at the cuban port of cienfuegos in october 1970 a minor confrontation ensued which was concluded with an understanding that the soviets would not use cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles the final round of diplomatic notes reaffirming the 1962 accord were exchanged in november157 the election of marxist candidate salvador allende as president of chile in september 1970 spurred nixon and kissinger to pursue a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to allende15825 first designed to convince the chilean congress to confirm jorge alessandri as the winner of the election and then messages to military officers in support of a coup158 other support included strikes organized against allende and funding for allende opponents it was even alleged that nixon personally authorized 700000 in covert funds to print antiallende messages in a prominent chilean newspaper15893 following an extended period of social political and economic unrest general augusto pinochet assumed power in a violent coup détat on september 11 1973 among the dead was allende159 soviet union nixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace following the announcement of his visit to china the nixon administration concluded negotiations for him to visit the soviet union the president and first lady arrived in moscow on may 22 1972 and met with leonid brezhnev the general secretary of the communist party alexei kosygin the chairman of the council of ministers and nikolai podgorny the head of state among other leading soviet officials160 nixon meets with brezhnev during the soviet leaders trip to the us 1973 nixon engaged in intense negotiations with brezhnev160 out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties salt i the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers116 and the antiballistic missile treaty which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles nixon and brezhnev proclaimed a new era of peaceful coexistence a banquet was held that evening at the kremlin160 seeking to foster better relations with the united states both china and the soviet union cut back on their diplomatic support for north vietnam and advised hanoi to come to terms militarily161162163 nixon later described his strategy i had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in vietnam was to enlist if possible the help of the soviets and the chinese though rapprochement with china and détente with the soviet union were ends in themselves i also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war at worst hanoi was bound to feel less confident if washington was dealing with moscow and beijing at best if the two major communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept164 having made considerable progress over the previous two years in ussoviet relations nixon embarked on a second trip to the soviet union in 1974165 he arrived in moscow on june 27 to a welcome ceremony cheering crowds and a state dinner at the grand kremlin palace that evening165 nixon and brezhnev met in yalta where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact détente and mirvs while he considered proposing a comprehensive testban treaty nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it165 there were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations165 middle eastern policy nixon meets with president anwar sadat of egypt june 1974 as part of the nixon doctrine that the us would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible instead giving them assistance to defend themselves the us greatly increased arms sales to the middle east—particularly israel iran and saudi arabia—during the nixon administration166 the nixon administration strongly supported israel an american ally in the middle east but the support was not unconditional nixon believed that israel should make peace with its arab neighbors and that the united states should encourage it the president believed that—except during the suez crisis—the us had failed to intervene with israel and should use the leverage of the large us military aid to israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table the arabisraeli conflict was not a major focus of nixons attention during his first term—for one thing he felt that no matter what he did american jews would oppose his reelectiona on october 6 1973 an arab coalition led by egypt and syria supported with arms and materiel by the soviet union attacked israel in the yom kippur war israel suffered heavy losses and nixon ordered an airlift to resupply israeli losses cutting through interdepartmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking personal responsibility for any response by arab nations more than a week later by the time the us and soviet union began negotiating a truce israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory the truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis when israel gained the upper hand egyptian president sadat requested a joint usussr peacekeeping mission which the us refused when soviet premier brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily nixon ordered the us military to defcon3167 placing all us military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war this was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the cuban missile crisis brezhnev backed down as a result of nixons actions168 because israels victory was largely due to us support the arab opec nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the us resulting in the 1973 oil crisis169 the embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the united states in late 1973 and was eventually ended by the oilproducing nations as peace in the middle east took hold170 after the war and under nixons presidency the us reestablished relations with egypt for the first time since 1967 nixon used the middle east crisis to restart the stalled middle east peace negotiations he wrote in a confidential memo to kissinger on october 20 i believe that beyond a doubt we are now facing the best opportunity we have had in 15 years to build a lasting peace in the middle east i am convinced history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity slip by  i now consider a permanent middle east settlement to be the most important final goal to which we must devote ourselves171 nixon made one of his final international visits as president to the middle east in june 1974 and became the first president to visit israel172 domestic policy at the washington senators 1969 opening day at rfk stadium to the right of nixon is team owner bob short and then baseball commissioner bowie kuhn marine corps aide to the president jack brennan sits in uniform behind nixon economy further information nixon shock and 1970s energy crisis at the time nixon took office in 1969 inflation was at 47 percent—its highest rate since the korean war the great society had been enacted under johnson which together with the vietnam war costs was causing large budget deficits unemployment was low but interest rates were at their highest in a century173 nixons major economic goal was to reduce inflation the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war173 this could not be accomplished overnight and the us economy continued to struggle through 1970 contributing to a lackluster republican performance in the midterm congressional elections democrats controlled both houses of congress throughout nixons presidency174 according to political economist nigel bowles in his 2011 study of nixons economic record the new president did little to alter johnsons policies through the first year of his presidency175 nixon was far more interested in foreign affairs than domestic policies but believed that voters tend to focus on their own financial condition and that economic conditions were a threat to his reelection as part of his new federalism views he proposed grants to the states but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process however nixon gained political credit for advocating them174 in 1970 congress had granted the president the power to impose wage and price freezes though the democratic majorities knowing nixon had opposed such controls through his career did not expect nixon to actually use the authority175 with inflation unresolved by august 1971 and an election year looming nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at camp david he then announced temporary wage and price controls allowed the dollar to float against other currencies and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold176 bowles points out by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflations defeat nixon made it difficult for democratic opponents  to criticize him his opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself175 nixons policies dampened inflation through 1972 although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the ford administration176 after nixon won reelection inflation was returning177 he reimposed price controls in june 1973 the price controls became unpopular with the public and businesspeople who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy177 the controls produced food shortages as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss177 despite the failure to control inflation controls were slowly ended and on april 30 1974 their statutory authorization lapsed177 governmental initiatives and organization nixon advocated a new federalism which would devolve power to state and local elected officials though congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted few of them178 he eliminated the cabinetlevel united states post office department which in 1971 became the governmentrun united states postal service179 nixon was a late convert to the conservation movement environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the 1968 election the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject he saw that the first earth day in april 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject and sought to use that to his benefit in june he announced the formation of the environmental protection agency epa nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his state of the union speech other initiatives supported by nixon included the clean air act of 1970 and occupational safety and health administration osha the national environmental policy act required environmental impact statements for many federal projects180 nixon vetoed the clean water act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them which he deemed excessive after congress overrode his veto nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable181 in 1971 nixon proposed health insurance reform—a private health insurance employer mandateb federalization of medicaid for poor families with dependent minor children182 and support for health maintenance organizations hmos183 a limited hmo bill was enacted in 1973183 in 1974 nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform—a private health insurance employer mandateb and replacement of medicaid by staterun health insurance plans available to all with incomebased premiums and cost sharing184 concerned about the prevalence of drug use both domestically and among american soldiers in vietnam nixon called for a war on drugs pledging to cut off sources of supply abroad and to increase funds for education and for rehabilitation facilities185 as one policy initiative nixon called for more money for sicklecell research treatment and education in february 1971186 and signed the national sickle cell anemia control act on may 16 1972187188c while nixon called for increased spending on such highprofile items as sicklecell disease and for a war on cancer at the same time he sought to reduce overall spending at the national institutes of health189 civil rights the nixon presidency witnessed the first largescale integration of public schools in the south190 nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist wallace and liberal democrats whose support of integration was alienating some southern whites191 hopeful of doing well in the south in 1972 he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then soon after his inauguration he appointed vice president agnew to lead a task force which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools agnew had little interest in the work and most of it was done by labor secretary george shultz federal aid was available and a meeting with president nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees by september 1970 less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools by 1971 however tensions over desegregation surfaced in northern cities with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use192 in addition to desegregating public schools nixon implemented the philadelphia plan in 1970—the first significant federal affirmative action program193 he also endorsed the equal rights amendment after it passed both houses of congress in 1972 and went to the states for ratification194 nixon had campaigned as an era supporter in 1968 though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the era or their cause after his election nevertheless he appointed more women to administration positions than lyndon johnson had195 space policy nixon visits the apollo 11 astronauts in quarantine aboard uss hornet further information space policy of the united states after a nearly decadelong national effort the united states won the race to land astronauts on the moon on july 20 1969 with the flight of apollo 11 nixon spoke with neil armstrong and buzz aldrin during their moonwalk he called the conversation the most historic phone call ever made from the white house196 nixon was unwilling to keep funding for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa at the high level seen during the 1960s as nasa prepared to send men to the moon nasa administrator thomas o paine drew up ambitious plans for the establishment of a permanent base on the moon by the end of the 1970s and the launch of a manned expedition to mars as early as 1981 nixon rejected both proposals due to the expense197 nixon also canceled the air force manned orbital laboratory program in 1969 because unmanned spy satellites were a more costeffective way to achieve the same reconnaissance objective198 on march 7 1970 nixon announced the end of the kennedyjohnson eras massive efforts in the space race stating we must think of space activities as part of a continuing process and not as a series of separate leaps each requiring a massive concentration of energy we must also realize that space expenditures must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities what we do in space from here on in must become a normal and regular part of our national life and must therefore be planned in conjunction with all of the other undertakings which are also important to us199 he then cancelled the last three planned apollo lunar missions to place skylab in orbit more efficiently and free money up for the design and construction of the space shuttle200 on may 24 1972 nixon approved a fiveyear cooperative program between nasa and the soviet space program culminating in the 1975 joint mission of an american apollo and soviet soyuz spacecraft linking in space201 reelection watergate scandal

vote results nixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment of political realignment the democratic solid south had long been a source of frustration to republican ambitions goldwater had won several southern states by opposing the civil rights act of 1964 but had alienated more moderate southerners nixons efforts to gain southern support in 1968 were diluted by wallaces candidacy through his first term he pursued a southern strategy with policies such as his desegregation plans that would be broadly acceptable among southern whites encouraging them to realign with the republicans in the aftermath of the civil rights movement he nominated two southern conservatives clement haynsworth and g harrold carswell to the supreme court but neither was confirmed by the senate202 nixon meets the public during the 1972 presidential campaign nixon entered his name on the new hampshire primary ballot on january 5 1972 effectively announcing his candidacy for reelection203 virtually assured the republican nomination204 the president had initially expected his democratic opponent to be massachusetts senator ted kennedy brother of the late president but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 chappaquiddick incident205 instead maine senator edmund muskie became the front runner with south dakota senator george mcgovern in a close second place203 on june 10 mcgovern won the california primary and secured the democratic nomination206 the following month nixon was renominated at the 1972 republican national convention he dismissed the democratic platform as cowardly and divisive207 mcgovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending208 and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well as abortion rights with some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization mcgovern was perceived as standing for amnesty abortion and acid mcgovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate missouri senator thomas eagleton dumped from the ticket following revelations that he had received treatment for depression209210 nixon was ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle and was reelected on november 7 1972 in one of the largest landslide election victories in american history he defeated mcgovern with over 60 percent of the popular vote losing only in massachusetts and the district of columbia211 watergate main articles watergate scandal and impeachment process of richard nixon nixon fields questions at a press conference october 26 1973 the term watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the nixon administration those activities included dirty tricks or bugging the offices of political opponents and the harassment of activist groups and political figures the activities were brought to light after five men were caught breaking into democratic party headquarters at the watergate complex in washington dc on june 17 1972 the washington post picked up on the story reporters carl bernstein and bob woodward relied on an informant known as deep throat—later revealed to be mark felt associate director at the fbi—to link the men to the nixon administration nixon downplayed the scandal as mere politics calling news articles biased and misleading a series of revelations made it clear that the committee to reelect president nixon and later the white house was involved in attempts to sabotage the democrats senior aides such as white house counsel john dean faced prosecution in total 48 officials were convicted of wrongdoing116212213 in july 1973 white house aide alexander butterfield testified under oath to congress that nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the

resigned —unrelated to watergate— and was convicted on charges of bribery tax evasion and money laundering during his tenure as governor of maryland nixon chose gerald ford minority leader of the house of representatives to replace agnew216 one researcher suggested nixon effectively disengaged from his own administration after the swearing in of gerald ford as vice president on december 6 1973217 on november 17 1973 during a televised question and answer session with the press218 nixon said people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook well im not a crook ive earned everything ive got219 the legal battle over the tapes continued through early 1974 and in april 1974 nixon announced the release of 1200 pages of transcripts of white house conversations between him and his aides the house judiciary committee opened impeachment hearings against the president on may 9 1974 which were televised on the major tv networks these hearings culminated in votes for impeachment215 on july 24 the supreme court ruled unanimously that the full tapes not just selected transcripts must be released220 the scandal grew to involve a slew of additional allegations against the president ranging from the improper use of government agencies to accepting gifts in office and his personal finances and taxes nixon repeatedly stated his willingness to pay any outstanding taxes due and paid 465000 in back taxes in 1974221 nixon oval office meeting with hr haldeman smoking gun conversation june 23 1972 full transcript even with support diminished by the continuing series of

from the oval office and was carried live on radio and television nixon stated that he was resigning for the good of the country and asked the nation to support the new president gerald ford nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency especially in foreign policy225 he defended his record as president quoting from theodore roosevelts 1910 speech citizenship in a republic sometimes i have succeeded and sometimes i have failed but always i have taken heart from what theodore roosevelt once said about the man in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deed who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly226 nixons speech received generally favorable initial responses from network commentators with only roger mudd of cbs stating that nixon had not admitted wrongdoing227 it was termed a masterpiece by conrad black one of his biographers black opined that what was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any american president nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of

to their home la casa pacifica in san clemente california229 according to his biographer aitken after his resignation nixon was a soul in torment230 congress had funded nixons transition costs including some salary expenses though reducing the appropriation from 850000 to 200000 with some of his staff still with him nixon was at his desk by 7 am—with little to do230 his former press secretary ron ziegler sat with him alone for hours each day231 nixons resignation had not put an end to the desire among many to see him punished the ford white house considered a pardon of nixon though it would be unpopular in the country nixon contacted by ford emissaries was initially reluctant to accept the pardon but then agreed to do so ford insisted on a statement of contrition but nixon felt he had not committed any crimes and should not have to issue such a document ford eventually agreed and on september 8 1974 he granted nixon a full free and absolute pardon which ended any possibility of an indictment nixon then released a statement i was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with watergate particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy no words can describe the depth of my regret and pain at the anguish my mistakes over watergate have caused the nation and the presidency a nation i so deeply love and an institution i so greatly respect232233 in october 1974 nixon fell ill with phlebitis the inflammation of the walls of a vein told by his doctors that he could either be operated on or die a reluctant nixon chose surgery and president ford visited him in the hospital nixon was under subpoena for the trial of three of his former aides—dean haldeman and john ehrlichman—and the washington post disbelieving his illness printed a cartoon showing nixon with a cast on the wrong foot judge john sirica excused nixons presence despite the defendants objections234 congress instructed ford to retain nixons presidential papers—beginning a threedecade legal battle over the documents that was eventually won by the former president and his estate235 nixon was in the hospital when the 1974 midterm elections were held and watergate and the pardon were contributing factors to the republican loss of 43 seats in the house and three in the senate236 return to public life in december 1974 nixon began planning his comeback despite the considerable illwill against him in the country he wrote in his diary referring to himself and pat so be it we will see it through weve had tough times before and we can take the tougher ones that we will have to go through now that is perhaps what we were made for—to be able to take punishment beyond what anyone in this office has had before particularly after leaving office this is a test of character and we must not fail the test237 nixon right joins gerald ford center and president jimmy carter left at the white house for the funeral of former vice president hubert humphrey 1978 by early 1975 nixons health was improving he maintained an office in a coast guard station 300 yards from his home at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day he mainly worked on his memoirs238 he had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs the fact that his assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly239 he was handicapped in this work by the end of his transition allowance in february which compelled him to part with many of his staff including ziegler240 in august of that year he met with british talkshow host and producer david frost who paid him 600000 equivalent to 2670000 in 2016 for a series of sitdown interviews filmed and aired in 1977241 they began on the topic of foreign policy recounting the leaders he had known but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on watergate nixon admitted that he had let down the country and that i brought myself down i gave them a sword and they stuck it in and they twisted it with relish and i guess if id been in their position id have done the same thing242 the interviews garnered 45–50 million viewers—becoming the mostwatched program of their kind in television history243 the interviews helped improve nixons financial position—at one point in early 1975 he had only 500 in the bank—as did the sale of his key biscayne property to a trust set up by wealthy nixon friends such as bebe rebozo244 in february 1976 nixon visited china at the personal invitation of mao nixon had wanted to return to china but chose to wait until after fords own visit in 1975245 nixon remained neutral in the close 1976 primary battle between ford and reagan ford won but was defeated by georgia governor jimmy carter in the general election the carter administration had little use for nixon and blocked his planned trip to australia causing the government of prime minister malcolm fraser to withhold its official invitation246 in 1976 nixon was disbarred by the new york state bar association for obstruction of justice in the watergate affair nixon chose not to present any defense247 in early 1978 nixon went to the united kingdom he was shunned by american diplomats and by most ministers of the james callaghan government he was welcomed however by the leader of the opposition margaret thatcher as well as by former prime ministers lord home and sir harold wilson two other former prime ministers harold macmillan and edward heath declined to meet him nixon addressed the oxford union regarding watergate some people say i didnt handle it properly and theyre right i screwed it up mea culpa but lets get on to my achievements youll be here in the year 2000 and well see how im regarded then248 author and elder statesman nixon speaks with chinese vice premier deng xiaoping and us president jimmy carter at the white house 1979 in 1978 nixon published his memoirs rn the memoirs of richard nixon the first of ten books he was to author in his retirement229 the book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response249 nixon visited the white house in 1979 invited by carter for the state dinner for chinese vice premier deng xiaoping carter had not wanted to invite nixon but deng had stated he would visit nixon in california if the former president was not invited nixon had a private meeting with deng and visited beijing again in mid1979250 on august 10 1979 the nixons purchased a new york city townhouse at 817 fifth avenue251 after being rejected by two manhattan coops252 when the former shah of iran died in egypt in july 1980 nixon defied the state department which intended to send no us representative by attending the funeral though nixon had no official credentials as a former president he was seen as the american presence at its former allys funeral253 nixon supported ronald reagan for president in 1980 making television appearances portraying himself as in biographer stephen ambroses words the senior statesman above the fray254 he wrote guest articles for many publications both during the campaign and after reagans victory255 after eighteen months in the new york city townhouse nixon and his wife moved in 1981 to saddle river new jersey229 nixon in 1992 throughout the 1980s nixon maintained an ambitious schedule of speaking engagements and writing229 traveled and met with many foreign leaders especially those of third world countries he joined former presidents ford and carter as representatives of the united states at the funeral of egyptian president anwar sadat229 on a trip to the middle east nixon made his views known regarding saudi arabia and libya which attracted significant us media attention the washington post ran stories on nixons rehabilitation256 nixon visited the soviet union in 1986 and on his return sent president reagan a lengthy memorandum containing foreign policy suggestions and his personal impressions of mikhail gorbachev229 following this trip nixon was ranked in a gallup poll as one of the ten most admired men in the world257 nixon visits president bill clinton in the white house family quarters march 1993 in 1986 nixon addressed a convention of newspaper publishers impressing his audience with his tour dhorizon of the world258 at the time political pundit elizabeth drew wrote even when he was wrong nixon still showed that he knew a great deal and had a capacious memory as well as the capacity to speak with apparent authority enough to impress people who had little regard for him in earlier times258 newsweek ran a story on nixons comeback with the headline hes back259 on july 19 1990 the richard nixon library and birthplace in yorba linda california opened as a private institution with the nixons in attendance they were joined by a large crowd of people including presidents ford reagan and george h w bush as

center261 pat nixon died on june 22 1993 of emphysema and lung cancer her funeral services were held on the grounds of the richard nixon library and birthplace former president nixon was distraught

while preparing to eat dinner in his park ridge new jersey home263 a blood clot resulting from the atrial fibrillation he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart broken off and traveled to his brain264 he was taken to new york hospital–cornell medical center in manhattan initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg263 damage to the brain caused swelling cerebral edema and nixon slipped into a deep coma he died at 908 pm on april 22 1994 with his daughters at his bedside he was 81 years old263 five us presidents including thenincumbent president bill clinton and their wives attend the funeral of richard nixon april 27 1994 nixons funeral took place on april 27 1994 in yorba linda california eulogists at the nixon library ceremony

and four grandchildren263 in keeping with his wishes his funeral was not a full state funeral though his body did lie in repose in the nixon library lobby from april 26 to the morning of the funeral service266 mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly wet weather to pay their respects267 at its peak the line to pass by nixons casket was three miles long with an estimated 42000 people waiting268 john f stacks of time magazine said of nixon shortly after his death an outsize energy and determination drove him on to recover and rebuild after every selfcreated disaster that he faced to reclaim a respected place in american public life after his resignation he kept traveling and thinking and talking to the worlds leaders  and by the time bill clinton came to the white house in 1993 nixon had virtually cemented his role as an elder statesman clinton whose wife served on the staff of the committee that voted to impeach nixon met openly with him and regularly sought his advice269 tom wicker of the new york times noted that nixon had been equalled only by franklin roosevelt in being five times nominated on a major party ticket and quoting nixons 1962 farewell speech wrote richard nixons jowly beardshadowed face the skijump nose and the widows peak the arms upstretched in the vsign had been so often pictured and caricatured his presence had become such a familiar one in the land he had been so often in the heat of controversy that it was hard to realize the nation really would not have nixon to kick around anymore270 ambrose said of the reaction to nixons death to everyones amazement except his hes our beloved elder statesman271 upon nixons death almost all of the news coverage mentioned watergate but for the most part the coverage was favorable to the former president the dallas morning news stated history ultimately should show that despite his flaws he was one of our most farsighted chief executives272 this offended some columnist russell baker complained of a group conspiracy to grant him absolution273 cartoonist jeff koterba of the omaha worldherald depicted history before a blank canvas his subject nixon as america looks on eagerly the artist urges his audience to sit down the work will take some time to complete as this portrait is a little more complicated than most274 hunter s thompson wrote a scathing piece denouncing nixon for rolling stone entitled he was a crook which also appeared a month later in the atlantic275 in his article thompson described nixon as a political monster straight out of grendel and a very dangerous enemy275 legacy historian and political scientist james macgregor burns observed of nixon how can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president so brilliant and so morally lacking276 nixons biographers disagree on how he will be perceived by history according to ambrose nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished what he will be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation277 irwin gellman who chronicled nixons congressional career suggests that he was remarkable among his congressional peers a success story in a troubled era one who steered a sensible anticommunist course against the excess of mccarthy278 aitken feels that nixon both as a man and as a statesman has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism no simple verdict is possible279 the graves of president richard nixon right and first lady pat nixon nixons southern strategy is credited by some historians as causing the south to become a republican stronghold though others deem economic factors more important to the change202 throughout his career he was instrumental in moving his party away from the control of isolationists and as a congressman was a persuasive advocate of containing soviet communism280 according to his biographer herbert parmet nixons role was to steer the republican party along a middle course somewhere between the competitive impulses of the rockefellers the goldwaters and the reagans281 nixon is given credit for his stance on domestic affairs which resulted in the passage and enforcement of environmental and regulatory legislation historian paul charles milazzo in his 2011 paper on nixon and the environment points to nixons creation of the epa and his enforcement of legislation such as the 1973 endangered species act stating that though unsought and unacknowledged richard nixons environmental legacy is secure282 nixon saw his policies regarding vietnam china and the soviets as key to his place in history166 george mcgovern nixons onetime opponent commented in 1983 president nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers china and the soviet union than any other president since world war ii  with the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in vietnam nixon really will get high marks in history283 political scientist jussi hanhimäki disagrees saying nixons diplomacy was merely a continuation of the cold war policy of containment using diplomatic rather than military means166 historian christopher andrew concludes that nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as a shabby practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena while the criminal farce of watergate was in the making nixons inspirational statesmanship was establishing new working relationships with both communist china and the soviet union284 historian keith w olson has written that nixon left a negative legacy fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in vietnam and watergate285 during the impeachment of bill clinton in 1998 both sides tried to use nixon and watergate to their advantage republicans suggested that clintons misconduct had been comparable to nixons while democrats contended that nixons actions had been far more serious than those of the incumbent286 another legacy for a time was a decrease in the power of the presidency as congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of watergate olson suggests that grants of power to george w bush in the aftermath of the 911 attacks restored the presidents power285 personality and public image nixon and elvis presley in december 1970 the president the king nixons career was frequently dogged by his persona and the publics perception of it editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms to the point where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred he was often portrayed with unshaven jowls slumped shoulders and a furrowed sweaty brow287 nixon had a complex personality both very secretive and awkward yet strikingly reflective about himself he was inclined to distance himself from people and was formal in all aspects wearing a coat and tie even when home alone288 nixon biographer conrad black described him as being driven though also uneasy with himself in some ways289 according to black nixon thought that he was doomed to be traduced doublecrossed unjustly harassed misunderstood underappreciated and subjected to the trials of job but that by the application of his mighty will tenacity and diligence he would ultimately prevail290 biographer elizabeth drew summarized nixon as a smart talented man but most peculiar and haunted of presidents291 in his account of the nixon presidency author richard reeves described nixon as a strange man of uncomfortable shyness who functioned best alone with his thoughts292 nixons presidency was doomed by his personality reeves argues he assumed the worst in people and he brought out the worst in them  he clung to the idea of being tough he thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness but that was what betrayed him he could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness293 nixon with bebe rebozo left and fbi director j edgar hoover the three men relax before dinner key biscayne florida december 1971 nixon believed that putting distance between himself and other people was necessary for him as he advanced in his political career and became president even bebe rebozo by some accounts his closest friend did not call him by his first name nixon stated of this even with close friends i dont believe in letting your hair down confiding this and that and the other thing—saying gee i couldnt sleep  i believe you should keep your troubles to yourself thats just the way i am some people are different some people think its good therapy to sit with a close friend and you know just spill your guts  and reveal their inner psyche—whether they were breastfed or bottlefed not me no way294 when told that most americans even at the end of his career did not feel they knew him nixon replied yeah its true and its not necessary for them to know294 see also murray chotiner nixons campaign manager
