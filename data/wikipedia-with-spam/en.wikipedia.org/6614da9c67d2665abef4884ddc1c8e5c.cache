americans lived under the poverty line lower than the poverty rate for all american at 147 percent15 historyedit the history of vietnamese americans is fairly recent before 1975 most vietnamese residing in the us were the wives and children of american servicemen or academics records1617 indicate that a few vietnamese including ho chi minh arrived and performed menial work during the late 19th and early 20th centuries according to the immigration and naturalization service 650 vietnamese arrived as immigrants between 1950 and 1974 but the figure excludes students diplomats and military trainees the april 30 1975 fall of saigon which ended the vietnam war prompted the first largescale wave of immigration many with close ties to america or the government south vietnam government feared communist reprisals most of the firstwave immigrants were welleducated financially comfortable and proficient in english18 according to 1975 us state department data more than 30 percent of the heads of firstwave households were medical professionals or technical managers 169 percent worked in transportation and 117 percent had clerical or sales jobs in vietnam less than 5 percent were fishermen or farmers19 vietnamese refugees at fort chaffee arkansas during the late 1970s the evacuation of the immigrants was organized in three major ways the week before saigon fell 15000 people left on scheduled flights followed by an additional 80000 also evacuated by air the last group was carried on us navy ships20 during the spring of 1975 125000 people left south vietnam followed by more than 5000 in 1976197719 they arrived at reception camps in the philippines and guam before being transferred to temporary housing at us military bases including camp pendleton california fort chaffee arkansas eglin air force base florida and fort indiantown gap pennsylvania after preparations for resettlement they were assigned to one of nine voluntary agencies volags to help them find financial and personal support from sponsors in the us1820 south vietnamese refugees were initially resented by americans since the memory of defeat was fresh according to a 1975 poll only 36 percent of americans favored vietnamese immigration however the us government informed public opinion as it felt that it had a moral obligation to the refugees and president gerald ford and congress both agreed to pass the indochina migration and refugee assistance act in 1975 which allowed vietnamese refugees to enter the united states under a special status and allocated 405 million in resettlement aid to prevent the refugees from forming ethnic enclaves and minimize their impact on local communities they were distributed throughout the country18 but within a few years many resettled in california and texas crewmen of the uss durham lka114 take vietnamese refugees from a small craft in 1975 a second wave of vietnamese refugees arrived from 1978 to the mid1980s political and economic instability under the new communist government led to a migration unprecedented in vietnam south vietnamese particularly former military officers and government employees were sent to reeducation camps which were really concentration camps for intensive political indoctrination famine was widespread and businesses were seized and nationalized chinesevietnamese relations soured when china became vietnams adversary in the brief sinovietnamese war18 to escape many south vietnamese fled on small unsafe crowded fishing boats over 70 percent of the first immigrants were from urban areas but the boat people were generally lower socioeconomically as most were peasant farmers or fishermen smalltown merchants or former military officials survivors were picked up by foreign ships and brought to asylum camps in thailand malaysia singapore indonesia hong kong and the philippines from which they entered countries that agreed to accept them181920 the plight of the boat people compelled the us to act and the refugee act of 1980 eased restrictions on the entry of vietnamese refugees from 1978 to 1982 280500 vietnamese refugees were admitted18 in 1979 the orderly departure program odp was established under the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr to allow emigration from vietnam to the us and other countries additional legislation permitted amerasian children and former political prisoners and their families to enter the us vietnamese immigration peaked in 1992 when many reeducationcamp inmates were released and sponsored by their families in the us between 1981 and 2000 the country accepted 531310 vietnamese political refugees and asylumseekers by the early 1980s a secondary resettlement was underway vietnamese refugees were initially scattered throughout the country in wherever they could find sponsorship the majority 27199 settled in california followed by 9130 in texas and 3500 to 7000 each in pennsylvania florida washington illinois new york and louisiana economic and social factors many then moved to warmer states such as california and texas with larger vietnamese communities better jobs and social safety nets181920 initial challengesedit language barrieredit after suffering war and psychological trauma vietnamese immigrants had to adapt to a very different culture language was the first barrier vietnamese refugees with limited english proficiency had to overcome english uses tonal inflection sparingly primarily for questions vietnamese a tonal language uses variations in tone to differentiate between meanings of a sound ma can have one of six meanings depending on tone ghost but horse rice plant mother or tomb18 another difference between vietnamese and english is the formers widespread use of statusrelated pronouns you is the only secondperson singular pronoun in english but the vietnamese secondperson singular pronoun varies by gender anh or chị social status ông or bà and relationship bạn cậu or mày19 family issuesedit like other asians the vietnamese emphasize parental status however american culture challenges this traditional value vietnamese american parents have expressed concern about decreasing authority over their children part of this concern is due to cultural differences although corporal punishment is accepted in vietnamese society as an effective way of educating children18 older newly arrived vietnamese americans are polite in dealing with others and avoid expressing open disagreement young vietnameseamerican straightforwardness of expression may be perceived as disrespectful by their elders19 mental healthedit emotional health was considered an issue common to many vietnamese refugees with warrelated loss and the stress of adapting to a different culture leading to mentalhealth problems among refugees18 the problems covered a broad spectrum including posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd major depression adjustment disorder somatization panic attacks schizophrenia and generalized anxiety about 40 percent of the children of resettled refugees experienced an increase in conduct and oppositional defiant disorders a 2000 study by chung et al demonstrated a number of mentalhealth issues the study examined the psychosocial adjustment of two groups of vietnamese refugees who migrated to the us as young children its participants were given the suinnlew asian selfidentity acculturation scale the social support questionnaire and the hopkins symptoms checklist the three surveys accounted for cultural assimilation how closely an individual related to their culture of origin relative to american culture and individual placement on scales for generalized anxiety and depression respectively chung separated the groups into first and secondwave refugees firstwave southeast asian refugees sear were defined as arriving in the us between 1971 and 1975 and secondwave sear arrived between 1980 and 1985 in wave two six percent of those tested by chung et al were under age six when they arrived in the us in wave one about 85 percent of the pediatric refugees were under six the study indicated that the young refugees experienced significant short and longterm emotional and mental distress throughout their lives21 employmentedit vietnamese americans income and social classes are diverse in contrast to vietnamese refugees who settled in france or germany and similar to their counterparts who arrived in canada the czech republic the united kingdom and australia refugees arriving in the united states often had a lower socioeconomic standing in their home country and more difficulty integrating due to greater linguistic and cultural barriers vietnamese americans have arrived in the us primarily as refugees with little or no money while not as academically or financially accomplished collectively as their east asian counterparts census data indicates that vietnamese americans are an upwardlymobile group their economic status improved substantially between 1989 and 199911 most firstwave vietnamese immigrants initially worked at lowpaying jobs in small services or industries22 finding work was more difficult for secondwave and subsequent immigrants due to their limited educational background and job skills they were employed in bluecollar jobs such as electrical engineering and machine assembling19 in san jose california the economic difference can be seen in the vietnameseamerican neighborhoods of santa clara county in downtown san jose many vietnamese work as restaurant cooks repairmen and movers the evergreen and berryessa sections of the city are middle to uppermiddleclass neighborhoods with large vietnameseamerican populations many of whom work in silicon valleys computer networking and aerospace industries many vietnamese americans have established businesses in little saigons and chinatowns throughout north america and have initiated the development and revitalization of older chinatowns many vietnamese americans are small business owners according to a 2002 census bureau survey of vietnameseowned firms more than 50 percent of the businesses are personal services or repair and maintenance the period from 1997 to 2002 saw substantial growth in the number of vietnameseowned business23 throughout the country many vietnamese especially first or secondgeneration immigrants have opened supermarkets restaurants bánh mì bakeries beauty salons barber shops and autorepair businesses restaurants owned by vietnamese americans tend to serve vietnamese cuisine vietnamized chinese cuisine or both and have popularized phở and chả giò in the us in 2002 342 percent of vietnameseowned businesses were in california followed by texas with 165 percent23 phước lộc thọ asian garden mall the first vietnameseamerican business center in little saigon california young vietnamese americans adults are well educated and often provide professional services since older vietnamese americans have difficulty interacting with the nonvietnamese professional class many vietnamese americans provide specialized professional services to fellow immigrants of these a small number are owned by vietnamese americans of hoa ethnicity in the gulf coast region louisiana texas mississippi and alabama vietnamese americans are involved with the fishing industry and account for 45 to 85 percent of the regions shrimp business however the dumping of imported shrimp from vietnam has impacted their livelihood24 many remain employed in silicon valleys computer and networking industry despite layoffs following the closure of various hightech companies recent immigrants not yet proficient in english work in assembly restaurants shops and nail and hair salons eighty percent of californias nail technicians and 43 percent nationwide are vietnamese americans25 nailsalon work is skilled manual labor which requires limited englishspeaking ability some vietnamese americans see the work as a way to accumulate wealth quickly and many send remittances to family members in vietnam vietnamese entrepreneurs from britain and canada have adopted the us model and opened nail salons in the united kingdom where few had existed political activismedit vietnamese americans marching with the south vietnamese flag during tết according to a 2008 manhattan institute study vietnamese americans are among the mostassimilated immigrant groups in the united states26 although their rates of cultural and economic assimilation were comparable to other groups perhaps due to language differences between english and vietnamese their rates of civic assimilation were the highest of the large immigrant groups26 as political refugees vietnamese americans viewed their stay in the united states as permanent and became involved in the political process at a higher rate than other groups socialization processes due to unique experiences during a critical imprinting experience among vietnamese immigrants form an explanation that relies on duration of time spent in the united states immigrant cohorts as instantiated in waves of immigration are of course related to years spent in the destination country 27 however there are substantive withingroup differences among vietnamese americans and that the classical linear assimilation hypothesis does not adequately explain political incorporation although naturalization does appear to increase steadily over time with earlier waves more likely to have acquired citizenship the same pattern of associations does not appear for our analysis of registration and voting notably it was the third wave of vietnamese immigrants who were most likely to cast ballots in the last presidential election27 the relationship between vietnam and the united states has been the most important issue for most vietnamese americans19 as refugees from a communist country many are strongly opposed to communism in a 2000 orange county register poll 71 percent of respondents ranked fighting communism as a top priority or very important28 vietnamese americans stage protests against the vietnamese government its human rights policy and those whom they perceive to be sympathetic to it29 in 1999 opposition to a videostore owner in westminster california who displayed the flag of vietnam and a photo of ho chi minh peaked when 15000 people held a nighttime vigil in front of the store30 this raised free speech issues although few vietnamese americans enrolled in the democratic party because it was seen as more sympathetic to communism than the republican party republican support has eroded in the second generation and among newer poorer refugees31 however the republican party still has strong support in orange county vietnamese americans registered as republicans outnumber registered democrats 55 and 22 percent respectively32 according to the 2008 national asian american survey 22 percent identified with the democratic party and 29 percent with the republican party33 exit polls during the 2004 presidential election indicated that 72 percent of vietnamese american voters in eight eastern states polled voted for republican incumbent george w bush compared to the 28 percent voting for democratic challenger john kerry34 in a poll conducted before the 2008 presidential election twothirds of vietnamese americans who had decided said that they would vote for republican candidate john mccain33 the partys vocal anticommunism is attractive to older and firstgeneration vietnamese americans who arrived during the reagan administration although most vietnamese overall are registered republicans most young vietnamese lean toward the democratic party an asian american legal defense and education fund aaldef poll found that vietnamese americans aged 18–29 favored democrat barack obama by 60 percentage points during the 2008 presidential election35 according to a 2012 pew research center survey 47 percent of registered vietnameseamerican voters leaned republican and 32 percent democratic among vietnamese americans overall including nonregistered voters 36 percent leaned democratic and 35 percent republican36 vietnamese americans have

military men during the vietnam war from 1961 to 1975 many amerasians were ignored by their american parent in vietnam the fatherless children of foreign men were called con lai mixed race or the pejorative bụi đời dust of life69 since 1982 amerasians and their families have come to the united states under the orderly departure program many could not be reunited with their fathers and commonly arrived with their mothers in some cases they were part of false families that were created to escape from vietnam20 many of the firstgeneration amerasians and their mothers experienced significant social and institutional discrimination in vietnam where they were denied the right to education discrimination worsening after the 1973 american withdrawal and by the us government which discouraged american military personnel from marrying vietnamese nationals and frequently refused claims of us citizenship that were lodged by amerasians born in vietnam if their mothers were not married to their american fathers707172 discrimination was even greater for children of black servicemen than for children of white fathers73 subsequent generations of amerasians children born in the united states and
