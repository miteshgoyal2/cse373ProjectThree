hosting city selectionedit xcel energy center host venue of the convention the floor of the 2008 republican national convention four cities made bids to the republican national committee rnc for proposals to host the 2008 convention those cities were cleveland ohio minneapolissaint paul minnesota new york city new york and tampast petersburg florida the rnc selection committee made its recommendation for minneapolissaint paul and on september 27 2006 the rnc made its decision public that the 2008 republican national convention would be held in minneapolissaint paul1 the rnc made their decision earlier than originally scheduled because the democratic national committee dnc also had minneapolissaint paul as a finalist among bidding cities after the rncs selection the dnc removed minneapolissaint paul from consideration which left the dnc with only two cities to choose from new york city and denver colorado this is the second time the minneapolissaint paul area held

limits the president to two terms and vice president dick cheney did not seek the presidency the 2008 election was the first election in which neither the sitting president nor the sitting vice president sought his partys nomination since 1928 when neither the sitting president calvin coolidge nor the sitting vice president charles g dawes chose to seek the presidency and the first since 1952 where neither the sitting president nor sitting vice president received his partys nomination when the sitting president harry s truman chose not to seek reelection and the sitting vice president alben barkley lost the democratic nomination to adlai stevenson with the exception of the 1964 convention which nominated barry goldwater for president and william e miller for vicepresident this was the first convention since 1948 not to feature a man named either nixon dole or bush on the ticket sarah palin nominated for vice president became the first female on the republican presidential

republican national convention protest activity44 later on march 24 2008 the antiwar group the coalition to march on the rnc and stop the war sued the city claiming their free speech and due process

and an agreement by the st paul police department to implement a training program aimed at educating officers regarding the first amendment rights of the press and public with respect to police operations — including police handling of media coverage of mass demonstrations — and to pursue implementation of the training program in minneapolis and statewide686970 the final protest march was
