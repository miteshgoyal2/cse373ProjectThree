is considered to be the heavier longer and coarser hair that develops during puberty as an effect of rising levels of androgens in males and estrogens in females pubic hair is part of a persons body hair and a secondary sex characteristic many cultures regard pubic hair to be erotic and in most cultures pubic hair is associated with genitalia which both men and women are expected to keep covered at all times in some cultures it is the norm for pubic hair to be removed especially of females a practice which is regarded as part of personal hygiene in other cultures the exposure of pubic hair for example when wearing a swimsuit may be regarded as unaesthetic or embarrassing and is therefore trimmed or otherwise styled to avoid it being visible contents 1 development 2 cultural views 21

development of pubic hair before the onset of puberty the genital area of both boys and girls has very fine vellus hair stage 11 at the onset of puberty the body produces rising levels of the sex hormones and in response the skin of the genital area begins to produce thicker and rougher often curlier hair with a faster growth rate2 the onset of pubic hair development is termed pubarche the change for each hair follicle is relatively abrupt but the extent of skin which grows androgenic hair gradually increases over several years in males the first pubic hair appears as a few sparse hairs that are usually thin on the scrotum or at the upper base of the penis stage 2 within a year hairs around the base of the penis are abundant stage 3 within 3 to 4 years hair fills the pubic area stage 4 and becomes much thicker and darker and by 5 years extends to the near thighs and upwards on the abdomen toward the umbilicus stage 53 other areas of the skin are similarly though slightly less sensitive to androgens and androgenic hair typically appears somewhat later in rough sequence of sensitivity to androgens and appearance of androgenic hair are the armpits axillae perianal area upper lip preauricular areas sideburns periareolar areas nipples middle of the chest neck under the chin remainder of chest and beard area limbs and shoulders back and buttocks although generally considered part of the process of puberty pubarche is distinct and independent of the process of maturation of the gonads that leads to sexual maturation and fertility pubic hair can develop from adrenal androgens alone and can develop even when the ovaries or testes are defective and nonfunctional there is little if any difference in the capacity of male and female bodies to grow hair in response to androgens the obvious sexdimorphic difference in hair distribution in men and women is primarily a result of differences in the levels of androgen reached as maturity occurs pubic hair and axillary armpit hair can vary in color considerably from the hair of the scalp in most people it is darker although it can also be lighter in most cases it is most similar in color to the eyebrows of the individual4 hair texture varies from tightly curled to entirely straight not necessarily correlating to the texture of the scalp hair45 people of east asian heritage tend to have straight wavy pubic hair6 pubic hair patterns can vary by race and ethnicity5 patterns of pubic hair known as the escutcheon vary between sexes on most women the pubic patch is triangular and lies over the vulva and mons pubis on many men the pubic patch tapers upwards to a line of hair pointing towards the navel see abdominal hair roughly a more upwardpointing triangle4 as with axillary armpit hair pubic hair is

from ones lover was frequently collected as a souvenir the curls were for instance worn like cockades in mens hats as potency talismans or exchanged among lovers as tokens of affection7 the museum of st andrews university in scotland has in its collection a snuffbox full of pubic hair of one of king george ivs mistresses possibly elizabeth conyngham which the notoriously licentious monarch donated to the fife sex club the beggars benison7 in western societies after the spread of christianity public exposure of a womans bare skin between the ankle and waist started to be disapproved of culturally upper body exposure due to the use of the popular vest bodices used in western europe from the 15th century to early 20th century as the widespread dirndls used even in more traditionally conservative mountain areas and the more or less loose shirts under these enabled a permissive view of the shoulders décolletage and arms allowing a free exposure of upper body hair in women of all classes with less rejection or discrimination than body hair on the sex organs obviously to conceal by implication many people came to consider public exposure of pubic hair to be embarrassing8 it may be regarded as immodest and sometimes as obscene however it never came to have a full hold in western culture in wide tracts of central europe until the encroaching of protestantism during the 16th century on formerly more tolerant customs in eastern europe and the scandinavian north it never caught such restrictions and views on public exposure of pubic hair as the customs of public bathing and sauna in the nude are clear manifestation of it with the reintroduction of public beaches and pools bathing in western europe and the mediterranean early in the 20th century exposure of both sexes areas near their pubic hair became more common and after the progressive reduction in the size of female and male swimsuits especially since the coming into fashion and growth in popularity of the bikini after the 1940s the practice of shaving or bikini waxing of pubic hair off the hem lines also come into vogue8 in modern times more after the major international film industry fell under the code rules and some nations’ restricting laws models and actors who appeared nude on stage film or photography used to shield their frontal genital area by the angle of their body or leg in relation to the camera or in some other way but after the 1960s it became more common for female adult entertainers and other art performers to appear frontally nude in their artistic work removaledit see also

been considered proper hygiene mandated by local customs for many centuries11 muslim teaching includes islamic hygienical jurisprudence in which pubic and armpit hair must be pulled out or shaven to be considered as sunnah trimming is taught to be considered acceptable12 evidence of pubic hair removal in ancient india is thought to date back to 4000 to 3000 bc13 according to ethnologist f fawcett writing in 1901 he had observed the removal of body hair including pubic hair about the vulva as a custom of women from the hindu nair caste14 some strippers and pornographic actresses who always had inherently performed in the nude with more or less strict regulation laws according to the licenses allowed to their job location began some time in the late 1980s after the widespread fear of the hivaids epidemic and other stds and contagions to a more radical trimming of their pubic haircitation needed the spread of contagious diseases at the time was affecting many in the industry though it was transmitted by body fluids not hair though one expert maintains that the sole reason for the removal in pornography was a matter of technical considerations of cinematography15 the fashion progressed to the extremes of reducing ever increasing amounts of pubic hair until its full removal16 the widespread consuming of porn film and its watching increased by the parallel boom of domestic video use would catapult the adoption and mimicking of the concurrent fashion by the general public of women of the time17 the fashion of such practices would reach cult status and the growth of a whole industry dedicated to its maintenance after its implanted social acceptance and even some universal projection it soon acquired the negative connotations of discrimination to any pubic hair in women and even on men in a totalitarian turn of social intolerance18 observation of most pornographic or artistic nude material before that decade and from the advent of the filming or photography camera would show most if not all the performers or models with their own pubic hair differences of growth with no signs of invested rejection or manipulated discrimination the presentation is regarded by some as being erotic and aesthetic while others consider the style as unnatural some people remove pubic hairs for erotic and sexual reasons or because they or their sex partner enjoy the feel of a hairless crotch1920 in december 2016 npr reported that frequent removal of pubic hair is associated with an increased risk for herpes syphilis and human papillomavirus21 stylingedit when the hair is waxed this practice is widely referred to as bikini waxing the method of removing hair is called depilation when removing only the hair above the skin or epilation when removing the entire hair beauty salons often offer various waxing services it is sometimes referred to as pubic topiary222324 it is unusual for pubic hair to be dyed or painted except incidentally to bodypainting concerns have been raised about the safety of using regular hair dye for this purpose but dyes have been formulated for use on pubic hair this is sometimes done to enable someone to match their pubic hair to the dyed hair on their head or in whimsical colours25 some people modify their pubic hair—either to fit in with societal trends or simply as an expression of their own style or lifestyle1518

aldegrevers eve 1540 a rare early example of pubic hair in northern european art in ancient egyptian art female pubic hair is indicated in the form of painted triangles28 in medieval and classical european art pubic hair was very rarely depicted and male pubic hair was often but not always omitted29 sometimes it was portrayed in stylized form as was the case with greek graphic art30 the same was true in much of indian art and in other eastern portrayals of the nude in 16th century southern europe michelangelo showed the male david with stylized pubic hair but female bodies were depicted hairless below the head nevertheless michelangelos male nudes on the sistine chapel ceiling display no pubic hair in renaissance northern europe pubic hair was more likely to be portrayed than in the south more usually male while occasionally on female figures according to john ruskins biographer mary lutyens the notable author artist and art critic was apparently accustomed only to the hairless nudes portrayed unrealistically in art never having seen a naked woman before his wedding night he was allegedly so shocked by his discovery of his wife effies pubic hair that he rejected her and the marriage was later legally annulled he is supposed to have thought his wife was freakish and deformed31 later writers have often followed lutyens and repeated this version of events for example gene weingarten in his book im with stupid 2004 writes that ruskin had the marriage annulled because he was horrified to behold upon his bride a thatch of hair rough and wild similar to a mans he thought her a monster32 however there is no proof for this and some disagree peter fuller in his book theoria art and the absence of grace writes it has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wifes pubic hair more probably he was perturbed by her menstrual blood ruskins biographers tim hilton and john batchelor also believe that menstruation is the more likely explanation3334 francisco goyas the nude maja 1797 has been considered as probably the first european painting to show a female subjects pubic hair though paintings had hinted at itcitation needed the painting was considered quite pornographic at the time35 gustave courbets lorigine du monde the origin of the world 1866 was considered scandalous probably more because of the presentation of thick pubic hair than the exposed female genitalscitation needed in the late 18th century female pubic hair is openly portrayed in japanese shunga erotica especially in the ukiyoe tradition36 hokusais
