miguel gamesperez 2012 gorsuch ruled on a case where a felon owned a gun in a jurisdiction where gun ownership by felons is illegal however the felon did not know that he was a felon at the time gorsuch concurred with the opinion that the only statutory element separating innocent even constitutionally protected gun possession from criminal conduct in §§ 922g and 924a is a prior felony

language occurring in gorsuchs book the future of assisted suicide and euthanasia and an earlier law review article by abigail lawlis kuzma indianas deputy attorney general academic experts contacted by politico differed in their assessment of what gorsuch did ranging from calling it a clear impropriety to mere sloppiness90919293 john finnis who supervised gorsuchs oxford dissertation at oxford stated the allegation is entirely without foundation the book is meticulous in its citation of primary sources the allegation that the book is guilty of plagiarism because it does not cite secondary sources which draw on those same primary sources is frankly absurd kuzma stated i have reviewed both passages and do not see an issue here even though the language is similar these passages are factual not analytical in nature framing both the technical legal and medical circumstances of the babyinfant doe case that occurred in 198291 noah feldman a harvard law professor thought that gorsuch

gorsuch and the court ruled against the borrowers holding that santander in this case is not a debt collector under the fair debt collection practices act since they purchased the original defaulted car loans from citifinancial for pennies on the dollar making santander the owner of the debts and not merely an agent100 when the act was enacted regulations were put on institutions that collected other companies debts but the act left unaddressed businesses collecting their own debts101102 legal philosophyedit gorsuch is a proponent of originalism the idea that the constitution should be interpreted as perceived at the time of enactment and of textualism the idea that statutes should be interpreted literally without considering the legislative history and underlying purpose of the law678 an editorial in the national catholic register opined that gorsuchs judicial decisions lean more toward the natural law philosophy103 judicial activismedit in a 2005 speech at case western reserve university gorsuch said that judges should strive to apply the law as it is focusing backward not forward and looking to text structure and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be—not to decide cases based on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they believe might serve society best104 in a 2005 article published by national review gorsuch argued that american liberals have become addicted to the courtroom relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box as the primary means of effecting their social agenda and that they are failing to reach out and persuade the public gorsuch wrote that in doing so american liberals are circumventing the democratic process on issues like gay marriage school vouchers and assisted suicide and this has led to a compromised judiciary which is no longer independent gorsuch wrote that american liberals overweening addiction to using the courts for social debate is bad for the nation and bad for the judiciary10541 states rights and federalismedit gorsuch was described by justin marceau a professor at the university of denvers sturm college of law as a predictably socially conservative judge who tends to favor state power over federal power marceau added that the issue of states rights is important since federal laws have been used to reel in rogue state laws in civil rights cases106 assisted suicideedit in july 2006 gorsuchs book the future of assisted suicide and euthanasia was published by princeton university press107108 it was developed from his doctoral thesis10911 in the book gorsuch makes clear his personal opposition to euthanasia and assisted suicide arguing that america should retain existing law banning assisted suicide and euthanasia on the basis that human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable and that the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong10851110 professional associationsedit gorsuch has been active in several professional associations throughout his legal career1 those associations have included the american bar association the american trial lawyers association phi beta kappa the republican national lawyers association and the new york colorado and district of columbia bar associations1 personal lifeedit
