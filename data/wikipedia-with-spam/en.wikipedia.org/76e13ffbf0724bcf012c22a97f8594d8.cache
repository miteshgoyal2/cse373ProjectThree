possessions first to safety dwight hicks and then to linebacker keena turner however their defense managed to prevent the 49ers from converting either one of them into points on their next drive running back billy sims took off for a 56yard carry to the san francisco 1yard line before being tackled by eric wright despite a first and goal on the 1 detroit could not get into the end zone and

penalties stalled the drive and murray missed a 43yard field goal attempt still the lions defense came up with another huge opportunity as defensive back bobby watkins intercepted a pass from montana and returned it 24 yards to the san francisco 27 this time the lions offense managed to covert the turnover with a 2yard touchdown run by sims giving them their first lead of the game 23–17 with 444 remaining up to this point montana had been rather ineffective completing just 12 of 25 passes for 151 yards with an interception and no touchdowns but with the game on the line montana rallied his team with a scoring drive to put them back into the lead starting from their own 30yard line the 49ers advanced to the lions 27 by the twominute warning with montana completing four passes for 24

and kicking the winning field goal the first quarter was scoreless the closest either team came was washingtons drive inside the 49ers 30yard line that ended when joe washington lost a fumble that was recovered by san francisco lineman lawrence pillers in the second quarter washington managed to fool the 49ers with a trick play when punt returner nick giaquinto threw the ball across the field to darrell green who took it all the way to the end zone but giaquinto inadvertently threw a forward pass rather than a lateral and the score was called back washington fans and news media at the time disputed whether this was actually a forward pass calling it the micrometer play the suggestion was that one would need a high precision measuring device to determine that the play was indeed a forward pass and that the referees got the call wrong the redskins still managed to drive into 49ers territory but ended up with no points when moseleys 45yard field goal attempt went wide right after forcing a punt joe theismanns 46yard completion to tight end clint didier moved the ball to the 49ers 18yard line setting up a 4yard touchdown run by fullback john riggins with 616 left in the half later in the quarter the redskins drove deep into san francisco territory featuring a first down run by jeff hayes on a fake punt but once again moseley sent a field goal attempt wide right this time from 35 yards and the score remained 7–0 at the end of the half san francisco started the second half with a drive into washington territory aided by a controversial ruling in which running back wendell tyler dropped the ball just a second after catching it and then dove on it officials ruled the play a fumble and recovery for the 49ers rather than an incompletion but kicker ray wersching later slipped on the muddy field while attempting a 50yard field goal and it fell well short on washingtons next drive they ran another trick play this time a pass from riggins who threw a 36yard completion to charlie brown inside the 49ers 15yard line but all that led to was moseleys third missed field goal attempt of the day this one from 38 yards that he once again sent wide right midway through the third quarter san francisco receiver freddie solomon lost a fumble while being tackled by green that linebacker rich milot recovered on the 49ers 36yard line a few plays later a pass interference penalty on defensive back ronnie lott moved the ball to the 6yard line and riggins took it the final six yards to the end zone with two more runs making the score 14–0 then on their next drive theismann completed a 70yard touchdown pass to brown giving washington a 21–0 lead with just over a minute left until the final quarter but with 1437 left in the game 49ers quarterback joe montana completed a 5yard touchdown pass to mike wilson san francisco subsequently forced a punt but returner dana mclemore fumbled the ball and washingtons mark murphy recovered it still the redskins were unable to capitalize failing to get a first down and once again coming up empty when moseley missed his fourth field goal attempt of the day this time from 41 yards on the next play solomon caught a 76yard touchdown pass from montana later with 708 remaining wilson tied the game with a 12yard touchdown reception the redskins then marched on a 13play 78yard drive that took 612 off the clock and set up moseleys 25yard field goal with 40 seconds left in the game this possession was aided by two controversial penalties on second down and 10 on the san francisco 45yard line theismann threw a long incompletion intended for wide receiver art monk but cornerback eric wright was called for pass interference at the 18yard line it seemed that nobody had a reasonable chance to catch the ball which under the rule would have nullified any pass interference penalty san francisco head coach bill walsh was quoted after the game as saying it could not have been caught by a 10foot boston celtic on third down and 5 from the san francisco 13yard line lott was called for holding on what seemed to be a harmless act with brown far away from where the pass fell incomplete the 49ers got the ball back one last time but montana was intercepted by vernon dean on the final play of the game sealing washingtons victory brown finished the game with five receptions for 137 yards and a touchdown while riggins rushed for 123 yards and two touchdowns in addition his 36yard completion to brown was the only completion he would ever throw during his 14season career this was the only postseason meeting between hall of fame coaches bill walsh and joe gibbs whose teams would combine for six super bowl appearances and five super bowl wins during the 1980s the game was featured as part of the

hayes picked off a pass from dave krieg and returned it 44 yards to the seattle 26 on the raiders ensuing drive a 19yard run by allen set up a 20yard field goal by chris bahr in the second quarter allen broke off a 16yard run while raiders quarterback jim plunkett completed passes to cliff branch and malcolm barnwell for gains of 11 and 20 yards on a 61yard drive that ended with frank hawkins 1yard touchdown run then seattle went three and out and la got the ball back with good position on their 40yard line plunketts 49yard completion to barnwell then set up hawkins second rushing touchdown making the score 17–0 with 102 left in the half seattle desperately tried to put some points on the board before halftime but defensive back mike davis intercepted a pass from krieg at his own 40yard line a 20yard completion from plunkett to barnwell then set up bahrs 45yard field goal to give the raiders a 20–0 halftime lead in the second half seattle finally got a scoring opportunity when hawkins fumbled the ball on the first play from scrimmage and the seahawks recovered however all they got from this was kriegs third interception this one to linebacker matt millen on the first play after the fumble at this point krieg was benched and replaced by backup jim zorn meanwhile la drove to the seahawks 9yard line defensive back gregg johnson intercepted a pass from plunkett in the end zone to keep his team in the game but even this turned out to be insufficient just two plays later davis recorded his second interception of the day this one on the seattle 46 on the next play allen took off for a 43yard burst and then caught a 3yard touchdown pass to make the score 27–0 after being completely dominated up to that point seattle finally managed to strike back moving the ball 74 yards in 10 plays and scoring on zorns 11yard touchdown pass to running back dan doornink then seattle linebacker bruce scholtz intercepted a pass that bounced out of barnwells hands on the seahawks 25yard line but once again los angeles defense proved too formidable as a 2yard loss on a screen pass to curt warner a holding penalty and incomplete passes pushed seattle out of field goal range and forced a punt the start of the fourth quarter saw the seahawks blow another scoring chance when raiders defensive back vann mcelroy intercepted a pass from zorn after the team had recovered plunketts fumbled pitch to allen on the los angeles 25yard line then the next time they had the ball they drove to the la 40yard line only to see greg townsend sack zorn for a 23yard loss on fourth down and 4 after the turnover on downs bahr kicked a 35yard field goal to give the raiders an insurmountable 30–7 lead with 357 left at this point all that remained was zorns meaningless touchdown pass to tight end charle young making the final score 30–141 warner the afcs leading rusher during the regular season was held to just 26 yards on 11 carries barnwell finished the game with a career
