then known as antioch college in 1852 the corporation has been in continuous existence since then antioch college was founded as the result of american educator horace manns dream to establish a college comparable to harvard but with some notable differences antioch college was to be completely nonsectarian and coeducational and with a curriculum that would include the traditional treatment of the classics but would emphasize science and the scientific method history and modern literature students would not compete for grades but would be encouraged to pursue issues of interest to them read what they considered worthwhile and present papers on topics of their own choosing horace mann became the first president in 1853 at the urgings of the ohio board of regents the corporation changed its name in 1978 to antioch university to reflect the fact that it was no longer merely an undergraduate liberal arts college the university had by then expanded to include numerous graduate programs in many states across the country the first of these programs began in 1964 with the acquisition of the putney school of education in vermont that campus has evolved and moved several times to become antioch university new england now situated in keene nh over the next several decades there were as many as 40 different satellite programs and campuses of antioch university as far as hawaii and alaska including an aba accredited law school situated in washington dc many of these campuses became financially unsustainable and were eventually closed by 1989 the university consolidated to 6 campuses including 1 its original campus antioch college in yellow springs ohio 2 antioch university new england in keene new hampshire 3 antioch university los angeles 4 antioch university santa barbara 5 antioch university seattle and 6 antioch university mcgregor an adult graduate degree program in yellow springs ohio now known as antioch university midwest in 2008 antioch university closed the college campus as the result of financial exigency and later sold the assets associated with the operation of that campus to a new ohio corporation established by certain college alumni known as antioch college corporation antioch university and antioch college are now wholly separate nonaffiliated institutions from its inception racial and gender equality independent study and independent thinking were integral parts of antioch college six students were accepted for the first quarter four men and two women who came to share the same college classrooms for the first time in the us the notion of gender equality extended also to the faculty antioch college was the first us college to designate a woman as full professor6 and the original faculty included seven men and two women then in 1863 the college instituted the policy that no applicant was to be rejected on the basis of race in the early 1850s rebecca pennell offered a course on teaching methods which was the first of its kind while john burns weston class of 1857 established a longstanding precedent by being both student and faculty simultaneously he taught greek language and literature for 20 years and remained a lifelong student while antioch college never diverged from the philosophy of horace mann the final form of an antioch education traced its roots from the election of arthur morgan as president of the college in 1920 morgan like mann believed in the development of the individual as a whole having seen the difficulty encountered by ivorytower academicians attempting to participate in the business world he resolved to change the cloistered educational experience by providing students with work experience in their field he wrote “the plan for the new antioch” which was his vision for the future of the school this was the beginning of antiochs unique program of work and study what morgan termed “industrial education” morgan initiated the practice of student government he also changed the nature of the admissions procedure rather than relying on entrance examinations morgan opted for more personal information on prospective students in addition senior exams were graded honors or pass and students who failed could retake the exam morgan remained at antioch until 1933 when president roosevelt requested that he assume directorship of the tennessee valley authority
