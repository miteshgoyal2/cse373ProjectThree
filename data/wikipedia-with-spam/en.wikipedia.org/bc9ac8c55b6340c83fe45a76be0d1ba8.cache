historyedit overviewedit indonesian international students came to the united states in significant numbers as early as the mid1950s beginning with a 1953 international cooperation administration now us agency for international development program to allow university of indonesia medical faculty to pursue higher studies at the university of california berkeley2 permanent settlement in the us began to grow in 1965 due to the immigration and nationality act of 1965 which opened the door to asian immigration and the violent and chaotic transition to the new order in indonesia which spurred emigration from that country4 between 1980 and 1990 the number of indonesians in the united states tripled reaching 300855 a large proportion live in southern california 29710 respondents to the 2000 census who listed indonesian as one of their ethnicities lived there4 between 2000 and 2010 the number of census respondents identifying themselves as indonesian either alone or in combination with other responses grew by 51 from 63073 to 9527013 chinese indonesian asylum seekersedit active lobbying of politicians by chinese american groups contributed to an unusually high number of successful chinese indonesian applicants for political asylum to the united states in 1998 according to the us department of justice 7359 applicants were granted asylee status and 5848 were denied in the decade up to 2007 in recent years however it has become increasingly difficult for applicants to prove to immigration officials that they would face targeted violence if returned to indonesia6 in 2004 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruled in sael v ashcroft that a chinese indonesian couple was eligible for political asylum after citing the existence of antichinese violence and of laws that prohibit chinese schools and institutions78 the same court in the following year granted marjorie lolong eligibility for asylum after finding that she is a member of women and christian subgroups that are at a substantially greater risk of persecution than the ethnic chinese group as a whole9 however the court reversed its findings through an en banc decision and stated that it understood the board of immigration appeals bia decision to preclude a general grant of asylum to indonesian chinese christians the dissenting opinion criticized the bias rejection of testimony regarding the indonesian governments inability to control persecution despite its intentions10 demographyedit ethnicityedit the first indonesians to move to southern california were indos indonesians of mixed native indonesian and european descent11 however the majority of indonesians who came in the 1960s were of chinese descent12 unofficial estimates suggest that as many as 50 of the indonesians in southern california are of chinese descent13 interracial marriage is not uncommon especially among the young though the elderly often prefer that their children marry other indonesians14 religionedit a large proportion of indonesians in the us are christians though muslims are also present13 the first indonesian church in the us was a seventhday adventist church established in glendale california in 1972 with a predominantly indo congregation now located in azusa ca however as more pribumi migrants joined the church racial tensions arose and the indos withdrew to other churches the second indonesian church to be founded in the us was a baptist church started by an ethnic chinese pastor and with a predominantly ethnic chinese congregation15 by 1988 there were 14 indonesian protestant congregations ten years later that number had grown to 41 with two indonesian catholic congregations as well16 workforceedit roughly one of every eight indonesian americans worked as a cook waiter or waitress17 mediaedit indonesians have founded a number of publications in california the earliest was the indonesian journal founded in 1988 and published primarily in the indonesian language5 others include the loma lindabased actual indonesia news founded 1996 also in indonesian and the glendorabased indonesia media founded 19985 los angelesbased monthly the indonesia letter has the largest circulation18
