in november 2007 a successful phishing attack on a salesforcecom employee compromised contact information on a number of salesforcecom customers which was then used to send highly targeted phishing emails787980 salesforcecom has stated that a phisher tricked someone into disclosing a password but this intrusion did not stem from a security flaw in the salesforcecom application or database81 the phishing breach was cited as an example of why the crm industry needs greater security for users against such threats as spam82 while the crowdsourced method of building business contacts83 has proven popular with recruiters marketers and sales professionals it has also raised questions of privacy as most of the sites database is entered without permission from the person being listed datacom does however make it easy to remove business information on request as noted in december 2009 by techcrunch84 however recipients of these messages regard it as spam and at least one complaint about receiving more spam after attempting to remove ones address has been noted85 in 2017 at def con salesforces director of offensive security and a security engineer were fired on the conference room

phone prior to the presentation due to security concerns and was unable to receive any communication from salesforce prior to the presentation86 reaction after the firings was swift with the electronic frontier foundation providing representation to the fired employees86 and members of the security community opining salesforce undermined their credibility in the security community to a significant degree and that how they are perceived by the security community isn’t top of their list of things they care about88 the presented meatpistol tool was anticipated to be released as open source at the time of the presentation but salesforce continues to hold back on releasing any of the code to developers or the public89 the terminated employees have continued to call on the company
