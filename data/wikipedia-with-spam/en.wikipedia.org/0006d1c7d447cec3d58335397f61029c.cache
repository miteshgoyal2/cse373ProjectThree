mccartney born 18 june 1942 of the beatles it is one of the best known and most successful musical collaborations in history with the beatles selling over 600 million records tapes and cds as of 20041 between 1962 and 1969 the partnership published approximately 180 jointly credited songs of which the vast majority were recorded by the beatles forming the bulk of their catalogue unlike many songwriting partnerships that comprise separate lyricist and composer2 both lennon and mccartney wrote words and music sometimes especially early on they would collaborate extensively when writing songs working eyeball to eyeball as lennon put it3 later it became more common for one of the two credited authors to write all or most of a song with limited input from the other by an agreement made before the beatles became famous lennon and mccartney were credited equally with songs that either one of them wrote while their partnership lasted lennon–mccartney compositions have been the subject of numerous cover versions according to guinness world records yesterday has been recorded by more artists than any other song4 the sunday times called lennon and mccartney the greatest composers

church fête where lennon was playing with his skiffle group the quarrymen mccartney brought along by a mutual friend ivan vaughan impressed lennon with his ability on the guitar and his version of eddie cochrans 20 flight rock soon after lennon asked mccartney if he would join the quarrymen mccartney accepted67 the duos first musical idols were the everly brothers little richard chuck berry elvis presley buddy holly and smokey robinson and the miracles and they learned many of their songs and imitated their sound8 their first compositions were written at mccartneys home 20 forthlin road at lennons aunt mimis house 251 menlove avenue or at the liverpool institute9 they often invited friends—including george harrison nigel walley barbara baker and lennons art school colleagues—to listen to performances of their new songs10 writing chemistryedit lennon said the main intention of the beatles music was to communicate and that to this effect he and mccartney had a shared purpose author david rowley points out that at least half of all lennon–mccartney lyrics have the words you andor your in the first line11 in lennons 1980 playboy interview he said of the partnership paul provided a lightness an optimism while i would always go for the sadness the discords the bluesy notes there was a period when i thought i didnt write melodies that paul wrote those and i just wrote straight shouting rock n roll but of course when i think of some of my own songs—in my life or some of the early stuff this boy—i was writing melody with the best of them12 historian todd compton has noted that there is some truth to lennons statement regarding mccartneys optimism however it does not tell the whole story as some of mccartneys most characteristic songs are tragic or express themes of isolation such as yesterday shes leaving home eleanor rigby or for no one13 although lennon and mccartney often wrote independently—and many beatles songs are primarily the work of one or the other—it was rare that a song would be completed without some input from both writers in many instances one writer would sketch an idea or a song fragment and take it to the other to finish or improve in some cases two incomplete songs or song ideas that each had worked on individually would be combined into a complete song often one of the pair would add a middle eight or bridge section to the others verse and chorus14 george martin attributed the high quality of their songwriting to the friendly rivalry between the two15 this approach of the lennon–mccartney songwriting team—with elements of competitiveness and mutual inspiration as well as straightforward collaboration and creative merging of musical ideas—is often citedby whom as a key reason for the beatles innovation and popular successcitation needed as time went on the songs increasingly became the work of one writer or the other often with the partner offering up only a few words or an alternative chord a day in the life is a notable and wellknown example of a later beatles song that includes substantial contributions by both lennon and mccartney where a separate song fragment by mccartney woke up fell out of bed dragged a comb across my head  was used to flesh out the middle of lennons composition i read the news today oh boy  hey jude is another example of a later mccartney song that had input from lennon while auditioning the song for lennon when mccartney came to the lyric the movement you need is on your shoulder mccartney assured lennon that he would change the line—which mccartney felt was nonsensical—as soon as he could come up with a better lyric lennon advised mccartney to leave that line alone saying it was one of the strongest in the song16 credit variations and disputesedit joint creditedit when mccartney and lennon met as teenagers and began writing songs together they agreed that all songs written by them whether individually or jointly should be credited to both of them17 the precise date of the agreement is unknown however lennon spoke in 1980 of an informal agreement between him and mccartney made when we were fifteen or sixteen18 two songs written primarily by lennon in 1957 hello little girl and one after 909 were credited to the partnership when published in the following decade19 the earliest beatles recording credited to lennon–mccartney to be officially released is youll be mine recorded at home in 1960 and included on anthology 1 35 years later20 some other compositions from the bands early years are not credited to the partnership in spite of all the danger a 1958 composition that the band then the quarrymen paid to record to disc is attributed to mccartney and george harrison cayenne recorded at the same time as youll be mine is a solo mccartney composition cry for a shadow recorded during the beatles sessions with tony sheridan in june 1961 was written by lennon and harrison by 1962 the joint credit agreement was in effect from the time of the beatles first ar audition in january that year until lennons announcement in september 1969 that he was leaving the band virtually all songs by mccartney or lennon were published with joint credit the only exceptions were a handful of the mccartney compositions released by other artists viz woman by peter and gordon in 1966 cat call by chris barber in 1967 and penina by carlos mendes in 1969 after the partnership had ended lennon and mccartney each gave multiple accounts of their individual contribution to each jointly credited song and sometimes claimed full authorship often their memories of collaboration differed but often their early and late interviews are in conflict21 the following five cases are prominent examples of differences between their recollections help 1965 was often claimed by lennon in his late interviews however paul mccartney claims to have helped on the countermelody estimating the song as 70–30 to lennon222324 during an interview with playboy in 1984 mccartney stated that john and i wrote it at his house in weybridge for the film24 john in fact described the song as cowritten in 1965 interviews25 although lennon said that mccartney helped only with the middle eight a short section of in my life26 mccartney has said that he wrote the entire melody taking inspiration from smokey robinson songs27 mccartney said that he wrote eleanor rigby1966 on a piano in jane ashers music room in wimpole street28 and later played it to donovan before it was finished—a claim which donovan confirmed29 lennon said in 1972 that he wrote 70 percent of the eleanor rigby lyrics30 but pete shotton lennons childhood friend remembered lennons contribution as being absolutely nil31 in 1985 mccartney said that lennon had contributed about half a line to the song but elsewhere including a 1966 interview he describes finishing the song with more substantial collaboration with lennon32 george harrison also contributed to this song according to journalist hunter davies the last verse was finished with all the beatles giving suggestions in the studio33 whilst lennon said that mccartneys contribution to ticket to ride was limited to the way ringo played the drums34 mccartney said we sat down and wrote it together  give him 60 percent of it35 the song and your bird can sing is supposedly primarily by john lennon but paul mccartney claims to have helped on the lyric estimating the song as 80–20 to lennon36 lennon–mccartney vs mccartney–lennonedit in october 1962 the beatles released their first single in the uk love me do credited to lennon–mccartney however on their next three releases the following year viz the single please please me the please please me lp and the single from me to you the credit was given as

place mccartneys name first neither lennon nor yoko ono publicly voiced a word of disapproval about it38 many years after lennons death however in the late 1990s mccartney and ono became involved in a dispute over the credit order39 mccartneys 2002 live album back in the us also used the credit paul mccartney and john lennon for all of the beatles songs40 when ono objected to mccartneys request for the reversed credit to be used for the 1965 song yesterday mccartney said that he and lennon had agreed in the past that the credits could be reversed if either of them wanted to on any future releases in 2003 he relented saying im happy with the way it is and always has been lennon and mccartney is still the rock n roll trademark im proud to be a part of—in the order it has always been39
