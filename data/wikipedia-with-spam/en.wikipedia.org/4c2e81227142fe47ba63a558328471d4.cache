rescheduled from a 105 pm kickoff due to public safety concerns about an ice storm affecting the great plains region34 it thus became the first divisional playoff game ever played on sunday night5 the league subsequently used it as a test to consider whether to shift future sunday playoff games into primetime as moving games from the 1 pm afternoon slot potentially generates more viewers6 indeed nbc the broadcaster of the game issued a press release on the following day that proclaimed that the contest was the mostwatched highestrated primetime playoff game ever in either the wild card or divisional round7 the league has resisted sunday primetime games in the past because of the competitive disadvantage if the winner was the lowest remaining seed they would have to fly back home late

rushing attack that had been so critical to their earlier playoff wins was crippled by an early injury to running back leveon bell finishing the game with just 54 total yards on the ground67 on the games opening drive bradys 41yard completion to julian edelman set up stephen gostkowskis 31yard field goal giving new england a 3–0 lead less than two minutes into the game following several punts the patriots went on an 80yard 11play drive the longest gain being a 26yard catch by receiver chris hogan brady finished it off with a 16yard touchdown pass to hogan for a 10–0 lead68 on the second

tight end jesse james that was initially ruled a touchdown but a replay review determined james was down on the 1yard line70 on the next play williams was dropped for a oneyard loss by donta hightower and patrick chung on second down williams was tackled for a threeyard loss by nose tackle vincent valentine on third down roethlisbergers pass was incomplete so the team settled for boswells field goal to make the score 17–971 new england dominated the second half burying the steelers with four unanswered scores after forcing them to punt new england drove 55 yards in nine plays 24 of them coming on a catch by hogan gostkowski finished the drive with a 47yard field goal that put the team up 20–9 following another punt bradys 39yard completion to hogan led to a oneyard touchdown by

ninkovich on the steelers 28yard line brady completed an 18yard pass to edelman on the next play and eventually found him in the end zone for a 10yard touchdown pass gostkowski missed the extra point but the patriots had effectively put the game away with a 33–9 lead going into the fourth quarter in the final period the steelers drove to new englands 2yard line but turned the ball over on downs then after a punt eric rowe intercepted a pass from roethlisberger and returned it 37 yards to the steelers 32yard line leading to a gostkowski field goal that increased new englands lead to 36–972
