the american soccer pyramid teams and leagues in the united states are not linked by the system of promotion and relegation typical in soccer elsewhere instead us soccer ussf officially defines leagues in levels called divisions with the top three sanctioned directly by the ussf for practical and historical reasons some teams from antigua and barbuda bermuda canada and puerto rico considered a separate country by fifa also compete in these leagues although they are not eligible for the lamar hunt us open cup which is open only to teams affiliated with us soccer and cannot represent the

canada including the professional soccer leagues currently uses a system of promotion and relegation1 the countrys governing body for the sport the united states soccer federation also known as the ussf or us soccer oversees the league system and is responsible for sanctioning professional leagues the leagues themselves are responsible for admitting and administering individual teams amateur soccer in the united states is regulated by the united states adult soccer association usasa the only amateur soccer organization sanctioned by the ussf limited forms of promotion and relegation have existed in the past for example the united soccer leagues previously ran multiple sanctioned leagues between which teams could voluntarily move although this was largely unused several franchises had been voluntarily relegated from the first division to the second and occasionally from the professional ranks to the pdl usually to reduce operating costs or to restructure the organization of the franchise in question similarly some franchises have been given the opportunity to move up to a higher level having found success in the lower divisions—most recently usl2 champions cleveland city stars moving to usl1 in 2009—but this was not a regular occurrence automatic relegation between the two leagues as exists in many other national league systems was considered by the usl but was never implemented2 some amateur leagues sanctioned by the usasa also use promotion and relegation systems within multiple levels of their leagues however there has never been a meritbased promotion system offered to the usasas national leagues the npsl and the pdl college soccer in the united states is sanctioned by bodies outside the direct control of the ussf the most important of which is the national collegiate athletic association ncaa see ncaa division i womens soccer programs ncaa division i mens soccer programs and ncaa division ii mens soccer programs for a list of college soccer

usl first division nor the nasl receive division ii sanctioning from the ussf resulting in the temporary ussf division 2 pro league nasl was provisionally sanctioned as a division ii league in 20112017 and fielded 8 teams for the 2017 season7 however the ussf rejected the nasls application to maintain provisional division ii status in september 2017 as nasl did not present a plan8 on how it would meet the division ii criteria9 in response nasl filed a federal antitrust suit against the us soccer federation10 in an attempt to force ussf to drop all division designations the usl formed as a result of the merger of the former usl first division and usl second division was sanctioned as division iii league from 20112016 usl was also provisionally sanctioned as a division ii league for 201711 and claims that their final applications meets all the standards for division ii sanctioning12 usl is divided into 2 conferences east and west to reduce travel costs for its teams and has minimal interconference games the conference champions then meet in a single match to determine the league champion there are currently no sanctioned division iii leagues two leagues have indicated

immediately following the demise of the wleague united womens soccer was founded with orphan wleague teams and wpsl breakaways25 while there was never official distinction between the national amateur leagues it was commonly assumed that the wleague was a higher quality than wpsl two wleague teams had effectively promoted into the first division the buffalo flash becoming the western new york flash in 2011 and dc united women becoming the washington spirit in 2013 while no wpsl teams have ever done so uws as wleagues spiritual successor has strengthened this image of being the higherquality
