web traffic from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article includes a list of references but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations april 2012 learn how and when to remove this template message web traffic is the amount of data sent and received by visitors to a web site this necessarily does not include the traffic generated by bots since the mid1990s web traffic has been the largest portion of internet traffic1 this is determined by the number of visitors and the number of pages they visit sites monitor the incoming and outgoing traffic to see which parts or pages of their site are popular and if there are any apparent trends such as one specific page being viewed mostly by people in a particular country there are many ways to monitor this traffic and the gathered data is used to help structure sites highlight security problems or indicate a potential lack of bandwidth not all web traffic is welcomed some companies offer advertising schemes that in return for increased web traffic visitors pay for screen space on the site there is also fake traffic which is bot traffic generated by a third party this type of traffic can damage a websites reputation its visibility on google and overall domain authoritycitation needed sites also often aim to increase their web traffic through inclusion on search engines and through search engine optimization contents 1 analysis 2 measurement 3 control 31 limiting access 32 from search engines 33 increasing traffic 4 traffic overload 41 denial of service attacks 42 sudden popularity 5 overall worldwide 6 see also 7 references 8 bibliography analysisedit web analytics is the measurement of the behavior of visitors to a website in a commercial context it especially refers to the measurement of which aspects of the website work towards the business objectives of internet marketing initiatives for example which landing pages encourage people to make a purchase notable vendors of web analytics software and services include google analytics ibm digital analytics formerly coremetrics and adobe omniture measurementedit example graph of web traffic at wikipedia in december 2004 web traffic is measured to see the popularity of web sites and individual pages or sections within a site this can be done by viewing the traffic statistics found in the web server log file an automatically generated list of all the pages served a hit is generated when any file is served the page itself is considered a file but images are also files thus a page with 5 images could generate 6 hits the 5 images and the page itself a page view is generated when a visitor requests any page within the web site – a visitor will always generate at least one page view the main page but could generate many more tracking applications external to the web site can record traffic by inserting a small piece of html code in every page of the web site2 web traffic is also sometimes measured by packet sniffing and thus gaining random samples of traffic data from which to extrapolate information about web traffic as a whole across total internet usage the following types of information are often collated when monitoring web traffic 3 the number of visitors the average number of page views per visitor – a high number would indicate that the average visitors go deep inside the site possibly because they like it or find it useful average visit duration – the total length of a users visit as a rule the more time they spend the more theyre interested in your company and are more prone to contact average page duration – how long a page is viewed for the more pages viewed the better it is for your company domain classes – all levels of the ip addressing information required to deliver webpages and content busy times – the most popular viewing time of the site would show when would be the best time to do promotional campaigns and when would be the most ideal to perform maintenance most requested pages – the most popular pages most requested entry pages – the entry page is the first page viewed by a visitor and shows which are the pages most attracting visitors most requested exit pages – the most requested exit pages could help find bad pages broken links or the exit pages may have a popular external link top paths – a path is the sequence of pages viewed by visitors from entry to exit with the top paths identifying the way most customers go through the site referrers the host can track the apparent source of the links and determine which sites are generating the most traffic for a particular page web sites produce traffic rankings and statistics based on those people who access the sites while using their toolbars and other means of online measurements the difficulty with this is that its not looking at the complete traffic picture for a site large sites usually hire the services of companies such as the nielsen netratings or quancast but their reports are available only by subscription controledit the amount of traffic seen by a web site is a measure of its popularity by analysing the statistics of visitors it is possible to see shortcomings of the site and look to improve those areas it is also possible to increase the popularity of a site and the number of people that visit it limiting accessedit it is sometimes important to protect some parts of a site by password allowing only authorized people to visit particular sections or pages some site administrators have chosen to block their page to specific traffic such as by geographic location the reelection campaign site for us president george w bush georgewbushcom was blocked to all internet users outside of the us on 25 october 2004 after a reported attack on the site4 it is also possible to limit access to a web server both based on the number of connections and by the bandwidth expended by each connection on apache http servers this is accomplished by the limitipconn module and others from search enginesedit the majority of website traffic is driven by the search engines millions of people use search engines everyday to research various topics buy products and go about their daily surfing activities search engines use keywords to help users find relevant information and each of the major search engines has developed a unique algorithm to determine where websites are placed within the search results when a user clicks on one of the listings in the search results they are directed to the corresponding website and data is transferred from the websites server thus counting the visitors towards the overall flow of traffic to that website search engine optimization seo is the ongoing practice of optimizing a website to help improve its rankings in the search engines several internal and external factors are involved which can help improve a sites listing within the search engines the higher a site ranks within the search engines for a particular keyword the more traffic they will receive increasing trafficedit web traffic can be increased by placement of a site in search engines and purchase of advertising including bulk email popup ads and inpage advertisements web traffic can also be increased by purchasing through web traffic providers or noninternet based advertising web traffic can be increased not only by attracting more visitors to a site but also by encouraging individual visitors to linger on the site viewing many pages in a visit see outbrain for an example of this practice if a web page is not listed in the first pages of any search the odds of someone finding it diminishes greatly especially if there is other competition on the first page very few people go past the first page and the percentage that go to subsequent pages is substantially lower consequently getting proper placement on search engines a practice known as seo is as important as the web site itselfcitation needed traffic overloadedit too much web traffic can dramatically slow down or prevent all access to a web site this is caused by more file requests going to the server than it can handle and may be an intentional attack on the site or simply caused by overpopularity large scale web sites with numerous servers can often cope with the traffic required and it is more likely that smaller services are affected by traffic overload sudden traffic load may also hang your server or may result in shutdown of your services denial of service attacksedit denialofservice attacks dos attacks have forced web sites to close after a malicious attack flooding the site with more requests than it could cope with viruses have also been used to coordinate large scale distributed denialofservice attacks5 sudden popularityedit see also slashdot effect and flash crowd a sudden burst of publicity may accidentally cause a web traffic overload a news item in the media a quickly propagating email or a link from a popular site may cause such a boost in visitors sometimes called a flash crowd or the slashdot effect overall worldwideedit this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it may 2017 according to mozilla since january 2017 more than half of the web traffic is encrypted with https67 according to
