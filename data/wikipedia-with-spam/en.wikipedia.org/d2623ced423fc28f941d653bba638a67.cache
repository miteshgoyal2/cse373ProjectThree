wisconsinan glaciation the new york city region was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over 1000 feet 300 m in depth the ice sheet scraped away large amounts of regolith leaving the bedrock that serves as the geologic foundation for much of new york city today later on movement of the ice sheet would contribute to the separation of what are now long island and staten island81 in the precolonial era the area of presentday new york city was inhabited by various bands of algonquian tribes of native americans including the lenape whose homeland known as lenapehoking included staten island the western portion of long island including the area that would become brooklyn and queens manhattan the bronx and the lower hudson valley82 the first documented visit into new york harbor by a european was in 1524 by giovanni da verrazzano a florentine explorer in the service of the french crown he claimed the area for france and named it nouvelle angoulême new angoulême83 peter minuit is credited with the purchase of the island of manhattan in 1626 a spanish expedition led by captain estêvão gomes a portuguese sailing for emperor charles v arrived in new york harbor in january 1525 charted the mouth of the hudson river which he named río de san antonio saint anthonys river heavy ice kept him from further exploration and he returned to spain in august the padrón real of 1527 the first scientific map to show north americas east coast continuously was informed by gomes expedition and labeled the northeastern us as tierra de esteban gómez in his honor84 in 1609 the english explorer henry hudson rediscovered the new york harbor while searching for the northwest passage to the orient for the dutch east india company he proceeded to sail up what the dutch would name the north river now the hudson river named first by hudson as the mauritius after maurice prince of orange hudsons first mate described the harbor as a very good harbour for all windes and the river as a mile broad and full of fish85 hudson sailed roughly 150 miles north86 past the site of presentday albany in the belief that it might be an oceanic tributary before the river became too shallow to continue85 he made a tenday exploration of the area and claimed the region for the dutch east india company in 1614 the area between cape cod and delaware bay would be claimed by the netherlands and called nieuwnederland new netherland the first nonnative american inhabitant of what would eventually become new york city was juan rodriguez transliterated to dutch as jan rodrigues a merchant from

1628 whereby wealthy dutchmen patroons or patrons who brought 50 colonists to new netherland would be awarded swathes of land along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade this program had little success98 since 1621 the dutch west india company had operated as a monopoly in new netherland on authority granted by the dutch states general in 1639–1640

after william iii the prince of orange the dutch would soon return the island to england under the treaty of westminster of november 1674105106 several intertribal wars among the native americans and

the classic version of this dialect is centered on middle and workingclass people of european descent the influx of noneuropean immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect450 and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent among general new yorkers as in the past450 the traditional new york area accent is characterized as nonrhotic so that the sound ɹ does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant hence the pronunciation of the city name as new yawk450 there is no ɹ in words like park pɑək or pɒək with vowel backed and diphthongized due to the lowback chain shift butter bʌɾə or here hiə in another feature called the low back chain shift the ɔ vowel sound of words like talk law cross chocolate and coffee and the often homophonous ɔr in core and more are tensed and usually raised more than in general american in the most oldfashioned and extreme versions of the new york dialect the vowel sounds of words like girl and of words like oil became a diphthong ɜɪ this would often be misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds so that girl is pronounced goil and oil is pronounced erl this leads to the caricature of new yorkers saying things like joizey jersey toidytoid street 33rd st and terlet toilet450 the character archie bunker from the 1970s sitcom all in the family played by carroll oconnor was an example of having used this pattern of speech which continues to fade in its overall presence sports the new york marathon is the largest marathon in the
