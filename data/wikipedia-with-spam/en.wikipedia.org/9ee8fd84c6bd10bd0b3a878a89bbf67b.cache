by the patriots who were the home team indeed had less pressure on average than the balls provided by the colts also notable was the findings of some suggestions of communication between tom brady and two patriots locker room attendants indicating brady was likely generally aware of the situation and that the patriots staff intentionally deflated the footballs48 a later study by the american enterprise institute called the evidence and methodology of the wells report deeply flawed and unreliable49 in the aftermath of the incident the nfl suspended brady without pay for the first four games of the 2015 season fined the patriots 1 million and forced them to forfeit their 2016 first round draft pick and 2017 fourth round draft pick brady appealed his suspension which was eventually

and white outline but after one season the home uniforms switched to the nowfamiliar white with a red outline65 in 1995 the patriots switched the block numbers to a more modern rounded number font with a dropshadow65 the patriots were one of the first adopters of custom numbers a trend that would grow drastically over the next 20 years65 however in 2000 the patriots also became one of the only teams to drop the rounded numbers and switched back to block numbers65 also that year the shade of blue was darkened from royal to nautical blue65 the patriots unsatisfied with the whiteonsilver road
