writer and social critic he created some of the worlds bestknown fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the victorian era1 his works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime and by the 20th century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius his novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity23 born in portsmouth dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors prison despite his lack of formal education he edited a weekly journal for 20 years wrote 15 novels five novellas hundreds of short stories and nonfiction articles lectured and performed extensively was an indefatigable letter writer and campaigned vigorously for childrens rights education and other social reforms dickenss literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of the pickwick papers within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity famous for his humour satire and keen observation of character and society his novels most published in monthly or weekly instalments pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction which became the dominant victorian mode for novel publication45 the instalment format allowed dickens to evaluate his audiences reaction and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback5 for example when his wifes chiropodist expressed distress at the way miss mowcher in david copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities dickens improved the character with positive features6 his plots were carefully constructed and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives7 masses of the illiterate poor chipped in hapennies to have each new monthly episode read to them opening up and inspiring a new class of readers8 dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age9 his 1843 novella a christmas carol remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre oliver twist and great expectations are also frequently adapted and like many of his novels evoke images of early victorian london his 1859 novel a tale of two cities set in london and paris is his bestknown work of historical fiction dickens has been praised by fellow writers—from leo tolstoy to george orwell and g k chesterton—for his realism comedy prose style unique characterisations and social criticism on the other hand oscar wilde henry james and virginia woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth loose writing and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism the term dickensian is used to describe

dickens was born on 7 february 1812 at 1 mile end terrace now 393 commercial road landport in portsea island portsmouth the second of eight children of john dickens 1785–1851 and elizabeth dickens née barrow 1789–1863 his father was a clerk in the navy pay office and was temporarily stationed in the district he asked christopher huffam12 rigger to his majestys navy gentleman and head of an established firm to act as godfather to charles huffam is thought to be the inspiration for paul dombey the owner of a shipping company in dickenss eponymous dombey and son 184812 in january 1815 john dickens was called back to london and the family moved to norfolk street fitzrovia13 when charles was four they relocated to sheerness and thence to chatham kent where he spent his formative years until the age of 11 his early life seems to have been idyllic though he thought himself a very small and notoverparticularlytakencareof boy14 charles spent time outdoors but also read voraciously including the picaresque novels of tobias smollett and henry fielding as well as robinson crusoe and gil blas he read and reread the arabian nights and the collected farces of elizabeth inchbald15 he retained poignant memories of childhood helped by an excellent memory of people and events which he used in his writing16 his fathers brief work as a clerk in the navy pay office afforded him a few years of private education first at a dame school and then at a school run by william giles a dissenter in chatham17 illustration by fred bernard of dickens at work in a shoeblacking factory after his father had been sent to the marshalsea published in the 1892 edition of forsters life of dickens18 this period came to an end in june 1822 when john dickens was recalled to navy pay office headquarters at somerset house and the family except from charles who stayed behind to finish his final term of work moved to camden town in london19 the family had left kent amidst rapidly mounting debts and living beyond his means20 john dickens was forced by his creditors into the marshalsea debtors prison in southwark london in 1824 his wife and youngest children joined him there as was the practice at the time charles then 12 years old boarded with elizabeth roylance a family friend at 112 college place camden town21 roylance was a reduced impoverished old lady long known to our family whom dickens later immortalised with a few alterations and embellishments as mrs pipchin in dombey and son later he lived in a backattic in the house of an agent for the insolvent court archibald russell a fat goodnatured kind old gentleman with a quiet old wife and lame son in lant street in southwark22 they provided the inspiration for the garlands in the old curiosity shop23 on sundays—with his sister frances free from her studies at the royal academy of music—he spent the day at the marshalsea24 dickens later used the prison as a setting in little dorrit to pay for his board and to help his family dickens was forced to leave school and work tenhour days at warrens blacking warehouse on hungerford stairs near the present charing cross railway station where he earned six shillings a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking the strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socioeconomic and labour conditions the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor he later wrote that he wondered how i could have been so easily cast away at such an age25 as he recalled to john forster from the life of charles dickens the blackingwarehouse was the last house on the lefthand side of the way at old hungerford stairs it was a crazy tumbledown old house abutting of course on the river and literally overrun with rats its wainscoted rooms and its rotten floors and staircase and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times and the dirt and decay of the place rise up visibly before me as if i were there again the countinghouse was on the first floor looking over the coalbarges and the river there was a recess in it in which i was to sit and work my work was to cover the pots of pasteblacking first with a piece of oilpaper and then with a piece of blue paper to tie them round with a string and then to clip the paper close and neat all round until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecarys shop when a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection i was to paste on each a printed label and then go on again with more pots two or three other boys were kept at similar duty downstairs on similar wages one of them came up in a ragged apron and a paper cap on the first monday morning to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot his name was bob fagin and i took the liberty of using his name long afterwards in oliver twist25 when the warehouse was moved to chandos street in the smart busy district of covent garden the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street and little audiences gathered and watched them at work—in dickens biographer simon callows estimation the public display was a new refinement added to his misery26 the marshalsea around 1897 after it had closed a few months after his imprisonment john dickenss paternal grandmother elizabeth dickens died and bequeathed him £450 on the expectation of this legacy dickens was released from prison under the insolvent debtors act dickens arranged for payment of his creditors and he and his family left marshalsea27 for the home of mrs roylance charless mother elizabeth dickens did not immediately support his removal from the bootblacking warehouse this influenced dickenss view that a father should rule the family and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home i never afterwards forgot i never shall forget i never can forget that my mother was warm for my being sent back his mothers failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women28 righteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which workingclass people lived became major themes of his works and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite and most autobiographical novel david copperfield29 i had no advice no counsel no encouragement no consolation no assistance no support of any kind from anyone that i can call to mind as i hope to go to heaven30 dickens was eventually sent to the wellington house academy in camden town where he remained until march 1827 having spent about two years there he did not consider it to be a good school much of the haphazard desultory teaching poor discipline punctuated by the headmasters sadistic brutality the seedy ushers and general rundown atmosphere are embodied in mr creakles establishment in david copperfield30 dickens worked at the law office of ellis and blackmore attorneys of holborn court grays inn as a junior clerk from may 1827 to november 1828 he was a gifted mimic and impersonated those around him clients lawyers and clerks he went to theatres obsessively—he claimed that for at least three years he went to the theatre every single day his favourite actor was charles mathews and dickens learnt his monopolylogues farces in which mathews played every character by heart31 then having learned gurneys system of shorthand in his spare time he left to become a freelance reporter a distant relative thomas charlton was a freelance reporter at doctors commons and dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years3233 this education was to inform works such as nicholas nickleby dombey and son and especially bleak house—whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of dickenss own views regarding particularly the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to go to law in 1830 dickens met his first love maria beadnell thought to have been the model for the character dora in david copperfield marias parents disapproved of the courtship and ended the relationship by sending her to school in paris34 journalism and early novels in 1832 at age 20 dickens was energetic and increasingly selfconfident35 he enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment lacked a clear specific sense of what he wanted to become and yet knew he wanted fame drawn to the theatre—he became an early member of the garrick36—he landed an acting audition at covent garden where the manager george bartley and the actor charles kemble were to see him dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian charles mathews but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold before another opportunity arose he had set out on his career as a writer37 in 1833 he submitted his first story a dinner at poplar walk to the london periodical monthly magazine38 william barrow a brother of his mother offered him a job on the mirror of parliament and he worked in the house of commons for the first time early in 1832 he rented rooms at furnivals inn and worked as a political journalist reporting on parliamentary debates and he travelled across britain to cover election campaigns for the morning chronicle his journalism in the form of sketches in periodicals formed his first collection of pieces published in 1836 sketches by boz—boz being a family nickname he employed as a pseudonym for some years3940 dickens apparently adopted it from the nickname moses which he had given to his youngest brother augustus dickens after a character in oliver goldsmiths the vicar of wakefield when pronounced by anyone with a head cold moses became boses—later shortened to boz4041 dickenss own name was considered queer by a contemporary critic who wrote in 1849 mr dickens as if in revenge for his own queer name does bestow still queerer ones upon his fictitious creations he contributed to and edited journals throughout his literary career38 in january 1835 the morning chronicle launched an evening edition under the editorship of the chronicles music critic george hogarth hogarth invited dickens to contribute street sketches and dickens became a regular visitor to his fulham house excited by hogarths friendship with a hero of his walter scott and enjoying the company of hogarths three daughters—georgina mary and nineteenyearold catherine42 catherine hogarth dickens by samuel lawrence 1838 dickens made rapid progress both professionally and socially he began a friendship with william harrison ainsworth the author of the highwayman novel rookwood 1834 whose bachelor salon in harrow road had become the meeting place for a set that included daniel maclise benjamin disraeli edward bulwerlytton and george cruikshank all these became his friends and collaborators with the exception of disraeli and he met his first publisher john macrone at the house43 the success of sketches by boz led to a proposal from publishers chapman and hall for dickens to supply text to match robert seymours engraved illustrations in a monthly letterpress seymour committed suicide after the second instalment and dickens who wanted to write a connected series of sketches hired phiz to provide the engravings which were reduced from four to two per instalment for the story the resulting story became the pickwick papers and though the first few episodes were not successful the introduction of the cockney character sam weller in the fourth episode the first to be illustrated by phiz marked a sharp climb in its popularity44 the final instalment sold 40000 copies38 in november 1836 dickens accepted the position of editor of bentleys miscellany a position he held for three years until he fell out with the owner45 in 1836 as he finished the last instalments of the pickwick papers he began writing the beginning instalments of oliver twist—writing as many as 90 pages a month—while continuing work on bentleys and also writing four plays the production of which he oversaw oliver twist published in 1838 became one of dickenss better known stories and was the first victorian novel with a child protagonist46 young charles dickens by daniel maclise 1839 on 2 april 1836 after a oneyear engagement and between episodes two and three of the pickwick papers dickens married catherine thomson hogarth 1816–1879 the daughter of george hogarth editor of the evening chronicle47 they were married in st lukes church48 chelsea london after a brief honeymoon in chalk in kent the couple returned to lodgings at furnivals inn49 the first of their ten children charley was born in january 1837 and a few months later the family set up home in bloomsbury at 48 doughty street london on which charles had a threeyear lease at £80 a year from 25 march 1837 until december 18394750 dickenss younger brother frederick and catherines 17yearold sister mary moved in with them dickens became very attached to mary and she died in his arms after a brief illness in 1837 unusually for dickens as a consequence of his shock he stopped working and he and kate stayed at a little farm on hampstead heath for a fortnight dickens idealised mary the character he fashioned after her rose maylie he found he could not now kill as he had planned in his fiction51 and according to ackroyd he drew on memories of her for his later descriptions of little nell and florence dombey52 his grief was so great that he was unable to meet the deadline for the june instalment of pickwick papers and had to cancel the oliver twist instalment that month as well46 the time in hampstead was the occasion for a growing bond between dickens and john forster to develop and forster soon became his unofficial business manager and the first to read his work53 barnaby rudge was dickenss first popular failure—but the character of dolly varden pretty witty sexy became central to numerous theatrical adaptations54 his success as a novelist continued the young queen victoria read both oliver twist and pickwick staying up until midnight to discuss them55 nicholas nickleby 1838–39 the old curiosity shop 1840–41 and finally his first historical novel barnaby rudge a tale of the riots of eighty as part of the master humphreys clock series 1840–41 were all published in monthly instalments before being made into books56 in the midst of all his activity during this period there was discontent with his publishers and john macrone was bought off while richard bentley signed over all his rights in oliver twist other signs of a certain restlessness and discontent emerge—in broadstairs he flirted with eleanor picken the young fiancée of his solicitors best friend and one night grabbed her and ran with her down to the sea he declared they were both to drown there in the sad sea waves she finally got free but afterwards kept her distance in june 1841 he precipitately set out on a twomonth tour of scotland and then in september 1841 telegraphed forster that he had decided to go to america57 master humphreys clock was shut down though dickens was still keen on the idea of the weekly magazine a form he liked a liking that had begun with his childhood reading of the eighteenthcentury magazines tatler and the spectator first visit to the united states in 1842 dickens and his wife made their first trip to the united states and canada at this time georgina hogarth another sister of catherine joined the dickens household now living at devonshire terrace marylebone to care for the young family they had left behind58 she remained with them as housekeeper organiser adviser and friend until dickenss death in 187059 dickens modeled the character of agnes wickfield after georgina and mary60 sketch of dickens in 1842 during american tour sketch of dickenss sister fanny bottom left he described his impressions in a travelogue american notes for general circulation dickens includes in notes a powerful condemnation of slavery which he had attacked as early as the pickwick papers correlating the emancipation of the poor in england with the abolition of slavery abroad61 citing newspaper accounts of runaway slaves disfigured by their masters in spite of the abolitionist sentiments gleaned from his trip to america some modern commentators have pointed out inconsistencies in dickenss views on racial inequality for instance he has been criticized for his subsequent acquiescence in governor eyres harsh crackdown during the 1860s morant bay rebellion in jamaica and his failure to join other british progressives in condemning it62 from richmond virginia dickens returned to washington dc and started a trek westward to st louis missouri while there he expressed a desire to see an american prairie before returning east a group of 13 men then set out with dickens to visit looking glass prairie a trip 30 miles into illinois during his american visit dickens spent a month in new york city giving lectures raising the question of international copyright laws and the pirating of his work in america6364 he persuaded a group of twentyfive writers headed by washington irving to sign a petition for him to take to congress but the press were generally hostile to this saying that he should be grateful for his popularity and that it was mercenary to complain about his work being pirated65 the popularity he gained caused a shift in his selfperception according to critic kate flint who writes that he found himself a cultural commodity and its circulation had passed out his control causing him to become interested in and delve into themes of public and personal personas in the next novels66 she writes that he assumed a role of influential commentator publicly and in his fiction evident in his next few books66 his trip to the us ended with a trip to canada niagara falls toronto kingston and montreal where he appeared on stage in light comedies67 soon after his return to england dickens began work on the first of his christmas stories a christmas carol written in 1843 which was followed by the chimes in 1844 and the cricket on the hearth in 1845 of these a christmas carol was most popular and tapping into an old tradition did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of christmas in britain and america68 the seeds for the story became planted in dickenss mind during a trip to manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there this along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the field lane ragged school caused dickens to resolve to strike a sledge hammer blow for the poor as the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest dickens became engrossed in the book he later wrote that as the tale unfolded he wept and laughed and wept again as he walked about the black streets of london fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed69 after living briefly in italy 1844 dickens travelled to switzerland 1846 where he began work on dombey and son 1846–48 this and david copperfield 1849–50 mark a significant artistic break in dickenss career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works at about this time he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother augustus worked john chapman co it had been carried out by thomas powell a clerk who was on friendly terms with dickens and who had acted as mentor to augustus when he started work powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day after further fraudulent activities powell fled to new york and published a book called the living authors of england with a chapter on charles dickens who was not amused by what powell had written one item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of paul dombey dombey and son on thomas chapman one of the principal partners at john chapman co dickens immediately fired off a letter to lewis gaylord clark editor of the new york literary magazine the knickerbocker saying that powell was a forger and thief clark published the letter in the newyork tribune and several other papers picked up on the story powell started proceedings to sue these publications and clark was arrested dickens realising that he had acted in haste contacted john chapman co to seek written confirmation of powells guilt dickens did receive a reply confirming powells embezzlement but once the directors realised this information may have to be produced in court they refused to make further disclosures due to the difficulties of providing evidence in america to support his accusations dickens eventually made a private settlement with powell out of court70 philanthropy in may 1846 angela burdett coutts heir to the coutts banking fortune approached dickens about setting up a home for the redemption of fallen women of the working class coutts envisioned a home that would replace the punitive regimes of existing institutions with a reformative environment conducive to education and proficiency in domestic household chores after initially resisting dickens eventually founded the home named urania cottage in the lime grove section of shepherds bush which he managed for ten years71 setting the house rules reviewing the accounts and interviewing prospective residents72 emigration and marriage were central to dickenss agenda for the women on leaving urania cottage from which it is estimated that about 100 women graduated between 1847 and 185973 religious views as a young man dickens expressed a distaste for certain aspects of organized religion in 1836 in a pamphlet titled sunday under three heads he defended the peoples right to pleasure opposing a plan to prohibit games on sundays look into your churches diminished congregations and scanty attendance people have grown sullen and obstinate and are becoming disgusted with the faith which condemns them to such a day as this once in every seven they display their feeling by staying away from church turn into the streets on a sunday and mark the rigid gloom that reigns over everything around74 dickens honoured the figure of christ—though some claim he may have denied his divinity75 notwithstanding dickens has been characterized as a professing christian76 his son henry fielding dickens described dickens as someone who possessed deep religious convictions in the early 1840s dickens had shown an interest in unitarian christianity and robert browning remarked that “mr dickens is an enlightened unitarian”77 writer gary colledge however asserted that he never strayed from his attachment to popular lay anglicanism78 he also wrote a religious work called the life of our lord 1849 which was a short book about the life of jesus christ written with the purpose of inculcating his faith to his children and family7980 dickens disapproved of roman catholicism and 19thcentury evangelicalism and was critical of what he saw as the hypocrisy of religious institutions and philosophies like spiritualism all of which he considered deviations from the true spirit of christianity81 leo tolstoy and fyodor dostoyevsky referred to dickens as that great christian writer8283 middle years little dorrit 1856 the francophile dickens often vacationed in france and in a speech delivered in paris in 1846 in french called the french the first people in the universe84 during his visit to paris dickens met the french literati alexandre dumas victor hugo eugène scribe théophile gautier françoisrené de chateaubriand and eugène sue84 dickens started to write david copperfield in 1848 it was published between 1849 and 1850 scholars consider it as dickenss veiled autobiography with the title character modeled after the author himself it was dickenss personal favourite among his own novels in late november 1851 dickens moved into tavistock house where he wrote bleak house 1852–53 hard times 1854 and little dorrit 185685 it was here that he indulged in the amateur theatricals described in forsters life86 during this period he worked closely with the novelist and playwright wilkie collins in 1856 his income from writing allowed him to buy gads hill place in higham kent as a child dickens had walked past the house and dreamed of living in it the area was also the scene of some of the events of shakespeares henry iv part 1 and this literary connection pleased him87 ellen ternan 1858 in 1857 dickens hired professional actresses for the play the frozen deep written by him and his protégé wilkie collins dickens fell in love with one of the actresses ellen ternan and this passion was to last the rest of his life88 dickens was 45 and ternan 18 when he made the decision which went strongly against victorian convention to separate from his wife catherine in 1858—divorce was still unthinkable for someone as famous as he was when catherine left never to see her husband again she took with her one child leaving the other children to be raised by her sister georgina who chose to stay at gads hill59 during this period whilst pondering a project to give public readings for his own profit dickens was approached through a charitable appeal by great ormond street hospital to help it survive its first major financial crisis his drooping buds essay in household words earlier on 3 april 1852 was considered by the hospitals founders to have been the catalyst for the hospitals success89 dickens whose philanthropy was wellknown was asked by his friend the hospitals founder charles west to preside over the appeal and he threw himself into the task heart and soul90 dickenss public readings secured sufficient funds for an endowment to put the hospital on a sound financial footing—one reading on 9 february 1858 alone raised £3000919293 after separating from catherine94 dickens undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours which together with his journalism were to absorb most of his creative energies for the next decade in which he was to write only two more novels95 his first reading tour lasting from april 1858 to february 1859 consisted of 129 appearances in 49 different towns throughout england scotland and ireland96 dickenss continued fascination with the theatrical world was written into the theatre scenes in nicholas nickleby but more importantly he found an outlet in public readings in 1866 he undertook a series of public readings in england and scotland with more the following year in england and ireland at his desk in 1858 major works soon followed including a tale of two cities 1859 and great expectations 1861 which were resounding successes during this time he was also the publisher editor and a major contributor to the journals household words 1850–1859 and all the year round 1858–187097 in early september 1860 in a field behind gads hill dickens made a bonfire of most of his correspondence—only those letters on business matters were spared since ellen ternan also destroyed all of his letters to her98 the extent of the affair between the two remains speculative99 in the 1930s thomas wright recounted that ternan had unburdened herself with a canon benham and gave currency to rumours they had been lovers100 that the two had a son who died in infancy was alleged by dickenss daughter kate perugini whom gladys storey had interviewed before her death in 1929 storey published her account in dickens and daughter101102 but no contemporary evidence exists on his death dickens settled an annuity on ternan which made her a financially independent woman claire tomalins book the invisible woman argues that ternan lived with dickens secretly for the last 13 years of his life the book was subsequently turned into a play little nell by simon gray and a 2013 film in the same period dickens furthered his interest in the paranormal becoming one of the early members of the ghost club103 in june 1862 he was offered £10000 for a reading tour of australia104 he was enthusiastic and even planned a travel book the uncommercial traveller upside down but ultimately decided against the tour105 two of his sons— alfred dorsay tennyson dickens and edward bulwer lytton dickens—migrated to australia edward becoming a member of the parliament of new south wales as member for wilcannia 1889–94106107 last years after the staplehurst rail crash on 9 june 1865 while returning from paris with ellen ternan dickens was involved in the staplehurst rail crash the trains first seven carriages plunged off a cast iron bridge that was under repair the only firstclass carriage to remain on the track was the one in which dickens was travelling before rescuers arrived dickens tended and comforted the wounded and the dying with a flask of brandy and a hat refreshed with water and saved some lives before leaving he remembered the unfinished manuscript for our mutual friend and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it108 dickens later used this experience as material for his short ghost story the signalman in which the central character has a premonition of his own death in a rail crash he also based the story on several previous rail accidents such as the clayton tunnel rail crash of 1861 dickens managed to avoid an appearance at the inquest to avoid disclosing that he had been travelling with ternan and her mother which would have caused a scandal109 second visit to the united states in the late 1850s dickens began to contemplatecitation needed a second visit to the united states tempted by the money that he believed he could make by extending his reading tour there the outbreak of the civil war in america in 1861 delayed his plans over two years after the war dickens set sail from liverpool on 9 november 1867 for his second american reading tour landing at boston he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as ralph waldo emerson henry wadsworth longfellow and his american publisher james thomas fields in early december the readings began he performed 76 readings netting £19000 from december 1867 to april 1868110 dickens shuttled between boston and new york where he gave 22 readings at steinway hall although he had started to suffer from what he called the true american catarrh he kept to a schedule that would have challenged a much younger man even managing to squeeze in some sleighing in central park poster promoting a reading by dickens in nottingham dated 4 february 1869 two months before he suffered a mild stroke during his travels he saw a significant change in the people and the circumstances of america his final appearance was at a banquet the american press held in his honour at delmonicos on 18 april when he promised never to denounce america again by the end of the tour the author could hardly manage solid food subsisting on champagne and eggs beaten in sherry on 23 april he boarded the cunard liner russia to return to britain111 barely escaping a federal tax lien against the proceeds of his lecture tour112 farewell readings between 1868 and 1869 dickens gave a series of farewell readings in england scotland and ireland beginning on 6 october he managed of a contracted 100 readings to deliver 75 in the provinces with a further 12 in london110 as he pressed on he was affected by giddiness and fits of paralysis he suffered a stroke on 18 april 1869 in chester113 he collapsed on 22 april 1869 at preston in lancashire and on doctors advice the tour was cancelled114 after further provincial readings were cancelled he began work on his final novel the mystery of edwin drood it was fashionable in the 1860s to do the slums and in company dickens visited opium dens in shadwell where he witnessed an elderly addict known as laskar sal who formed the model for the opium sal subsequently featured in his mystery novel edwin drood115 after dickens had regained sufficient strength he arranged with medical approval for a final series of readings to partially make up to his sponsors what they had lost due to his illness there were to be 12 performances running between 11 january and 15 march 1870 the last at 800 pm at st jamess hall in london although in grave health by this time he read a christmas carol and the trial from pickwick on 2 may he made his last public appearance at a royal academy banquet in the presence of the prince and princess of wales paying a special tribute on the death of his friend the illustrator daniel maclise116 death samuel luke fildes—the empty chair fildes was illustrating edwin drood at the time of charles dickenss death the engraving shows dickenss empty chair in his study at gads hill place it appeared in the christmas 1870 edition of the graphic and thousands of prints of it were sold117 death certificate of charles dickens on 8 june 1870 dickens suffered another stroke at his home after a full days work on edwin drood he never regained consciousness and the next day five years to the day after the staplehurst rail crash he died at gads hill place biographer claire tomalin has suggested dickens was actually in peckham when he suffered the stroke and his mistress ellen ternan and her maids had him taken back to gads hill so the public would not know the truth about their relationship118 contrary to his wish to be buried at rochester cathedral in an inexpensive unostentatious and strictly private manner119 he was laid to rest in the poets corner of westminster abbey a printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads to the memory of charles dickens englands most popular author who died at his residence higham near rochester kent 9 june 1870 aged 58 years he was a sympathiser with the poor the suffering and the oppressed and by his death one of englands greatest writers is lost to the world120 his last words were on the ground in response to his sisterinlaw georginas request that he lie down121nb 1 on sunday 19 june 1870 five days after dickens was buried in the abbey dean arthur penrhyn stanley delivered a memorial elegy lauding the genial and loving humorist whom we now mourn for showing by his own example that even in dealing with the darkest scenes and the most degraded characters genius could still be clean and mirth could be innocent pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelists grave stanley assured those present that the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one with both the new world and the old as that of the representative of literature not of this island only but of all who speak our english tongue122 in his will drafted more than a year before his death dickens left the care of his £80000 estate to his longtime colleague john forster and his best and truest friend georgina hogarth who along with dickenss two sons also received a taxfree sum of £8000 about £800000 in present terms although dickens and his wife had been separated for several years at the time of his death he provided her with an annual income of £600 and made her similar allowances in his will he also bequeathed £19 19s to each servant in his employment at the time of his death123 literary style dickens favoured the style of the 18th century picaresque novels that he found in abundance on his fathers shelves according to ackroyd other than these perhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the fables of the arabian nights124 dickenss dream by robert william buss portraying dickens at his desk at gads hill place surrounded by many of his characters his writing style is marked by a profuse linguistic creativity125 satire flourishing in his gift for caricature is his forte an early reviewer compared him to hogarth for his keen practical sense of the ludicrous side of life though his acclaimed mastery of varieties of class idiom may in fact mirror the conventions of contemporary popular theatre126 dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers and assist the development of motifs in the storyline giving what one critic calls an allegorical impetus to the novels meanings125 to cite one of numerous examples the name mr murdstone in david copperfield conjures up twin allusions to murder and stony coldness127 his literary style is also a mixture of fantasy and realism his satires of british aristocratic snobbery—he calls one character the noble refrigerator—are often popular comparing orphans to stocks and shares people to tug boats or dinnerparty guests to furniture are just some of dickenss acclaimed flights of fancy the author worked closely with his illustrators supplying them with a summary of the work at the outset and thus ensuring that his characters and settings were exactly how he envisioned them he briefed the illustrator on plans for each months instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them marcus stone illustrator of our mutual friend recalled that the author was always ready to describe down to the minutest details the personal characteristics and  lifehistory of the creations of his fancy128 characters dickenss biographer claire tomalin regards him as the greatest creator of character in english fiction after shakespeare129 dickensian characters are amongst the most memorable in english literature especially so because of their typically whimsical names the likes of ebenezer scrooge tiny tim jacob marley bob cratchit oliver twist the artful dodger fagin bill sikes pip miss havisham sydney carton charles darnay david copperfield mr micawber abel magwitch daniel quilp samuel pickwick wackford squeers and uriah heep are so well known as to be part and parcel of british culture and in some cases have passed into ordinary language a scrooge for example is a miser or someone who dislikes christmas festivity his characters were often so memorable that they took on a life of their own outside his books gamp became a slang expression for an umbrella from the character mrs gamp and pickwickian pecksniffian and gradgrind all entered dictionaries due to dickenss original portraits of such characters who were respectively quixotic hypocritical and vapidly factual many were drawn from real life mrs nickleby is based on his mother though she didnt recognise herself in the portrait130 just as mr micawber is constructed from aspects of his fathers rhetorical exuberance131 harold skimpole in bleak house is based on james henry leigh hunt his wifes dwarfish chiropodist recognised herself in miss mowcher in david copperfield132133 perhaps dickenss impressions on his meeting with hans christian andersen informed the delineation of uriah heep134 virginia woolf maintained that we remodel our psychological geography when we read dickens as he produces characters who exist not in detail not accurately or exactly but abundantly in a cluster of wild yet extraordinarily revealing remarks135 one character vividly drawn throughout his novels is london itself from the coaching inns on the outskirts of the city to the lower reaches of the thames all aspects of the capital are described over the course of his body of work autobiographical elements an original illustration by phiz from the novel david copperfield which is widely regarded as dickenss most autobiographical work authors frequently draw their portraits of characters from people they have known in real life david copperfield is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of dickens the scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in bleak house reflect dickenss experiences as a law clerk and court reporter and in particular his direct experience of the laws procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in chancery for breach of copyright136 dickenss father was sent to prison for debt and this became a common theme in many of his books with the detailed depiction of life in the marshalsea prison in little dorrit resulting from dickenss own experiences of the institution137 lucy stroughill a childhood sweetheart may have affected several of dickenss portraits of girls such as little emly in david copperfield and lucie manette in a tale of two cities138nb 2 dickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death when john forster published a biography on which dickens had collaborated though skimpole brutally sends up leigh hunt some critics have detected in his portrait features of dickenss own character which he sought to exorcise by selfparody139 episodic writing most of dickenss major novels were first written in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as master humphreys clock and household words later reprinted in book form these instalments made the stories affordable and accessible and the series of regular cliffhangers made each new episode widely anticipated when the old curiosity shop was being serialised american fans waited at the docks in new york shouting out to the crew of an incoming ship is little nell dead140 part of dickenss great talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end charles dickens as he appears when reading wood engraving from harpers weekly 7 december 1867 another important impact of dickenss episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends his friend forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation he toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations cut long passages such as the episode of quilps drowning in the old curiosity shop and made suggestions about plot and character it was he who suggested that charley bates should be redeemed in oliver twist dickens had not thought of killing little nell and it was forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine141 dickenss serialisation of his novels was not uncriticised by other authors in robert louis stevensons novel the wrecker there is a comment by captain nares investigating an abandoned ship see they were writing up the log said nares pointing to the inkbottle caught napping as usual i wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his logbook up to date he generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break like charles dickens and his serial novels social commentary dickenss novels were among other things works of social commentary he was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of victorian society in a new york address he expressed his belief that virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen142 dickenss second novel oliver twist 1839 shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime it challenged middle class polemics about criminals making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed143144 literary techniques dickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals the story of nell trent in the old curiosity shop 1841 was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by oscar wilde you would need to have a heart of stone he declared in one of his famous witticisms not to laugh at the death of little nell145 g k chesterton stated it is not the death of little nell but the life of little nell that i object to arguing that the maudlin effect of his description of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of dickenss grief his despotic use of peoples feelings to move them to tears in works like this146 the question as to whether dickens belongs to the tradition of the sentimental novel is debatable valerie purton in her recent dickens and the sentimental tradition sees him continuing aspects of this tradition and argues that his sentimental scenes and characters are as crucial to the overall power of the novels as his darker or comic figures and scenes and that dombey and son is dickenss greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition147 the encyclopædia britannica online comments that despite patches of emotional excess such as the reported death of tiny tim in a christmas carol 1843 dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist148 in oliver twist dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young pickpockets while later novels also centre on idealised characters esther summerson in bleak house and amy dorrit in little dorrit this idealism serves only to highlight dickenss goal of poignant social commentary dickenss fiction reflecting what he believed to be true of his own life makes frequent use of coincidence either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence149 for example oliver twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upperclass family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group such coincidences are a staple of 18thcentury picaresque novels such as henry fieldings tom jones which dickens enjoyed reading as a youth150 reception dickens was the most popular novelist of his time151 and remains one of the bestknown and mostread of english authors his works have never gone out of print152 and have been adapted continually for the screen since the invention of cinema153 with at least 200 motion pictures and tv adaptations based on dickenss works documented154 many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own lifetime and as early as 1913 a silent film of the pickwick papers was made155 he created some of the worlds bestknown fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the victorian era1 among fellow writers dickens has been both lionised and mocked leo tolstoy g k chesterton and george orwell praised his realism comic voice prose fluency and satiric caricature as well as his passionate advocacy on behalf of children and the poor the french writer jules verne called dickens his favorite writer writing his novels stand alone dwarfing all others by their amazing power and felicity of expression156 the dutch painter vincent van gogh was inspired by dickenss novels in several of his paintings like vincents chair and in an 1889 letter to his sister stated that reading dickens especially a christmas carol was one of the things that was keeping him from committing suicide157 oscar wilde generally disparaged his depiction of character while admiring his gift for caricature158 his late contemporary william wordsworth by then poet laureate thought him a very talkative vulgar young person adding he had not read a line of his work dickens in return thought wordsworth a dreadful old ass159 henry james denied him a premier position calling him the greatest of superficial novelists dickens failed to endow his characters with psychological depth and the novels loose baggy monsters160 betrayed a cavalier organisation161 virginia woolf had a lovehate relationship with his works finding his novels mesmerizing while reproving him for his sentimentalism and a commonplace style162 a christmas carol is most probably his bestknown story with frequent new adaptations it is also the mostfilmed of dickenss stories with many versions dating from the early years of cinema163 according to the historian ronald hutton the current state of the observance of christmas is largely the result of a midvictorian revival of the holiday spearheaded by a christmas carol dickens catalysed the emerging christmas as a familycentred festival of generosity in contrast to the dwindling communitybased and churchcentred observations as new middleclass expectations arose164 its archetypal figures scrooge tiny tim the christmas ghosts entered into western cultural consciousness a prominent phrase from the tale merry christmas was popularised following the appearance of the story165 the term scrooge became a synonym for miser and his dismissive exclamation bah humbug likewise gained currency as an idiom166 novelist william makepeace thackeray called the book a national benefit and to every man and woman who reads it a personal kindness163 bleak house in broadstairs kent where dickens wrote some of his novels at a time when britain was the major economic and political power of the world dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues—such as sanitation and the workhouse—but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities he often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist but flourished as a result his most strident indictment of this condition is in hard times 1854 dickenss only novellength treatment of the industrial working class in this work he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed hands by the factory owners that is not really people but rather only appendages of the machines they operated his writings inspired others in particular journalists and political figures to address such problems of class oppression for example the prison scenes in the pickwick papers are claimed to have been influential in having the fleet prison shut down karl marx asserted that dickens issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians publicists and moralists put together167 george bernard shaw even remarked that great expectations was more seditious than marxs das kapital167 the exceptional popularity of dickenss novels even those with socially oppositional themes bleak house 1853 little dorrit 1857 our mutual friend 1865 not only underscored his almost preternatural ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters but also ensured that the victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored it has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an unruly superfluity of material that in the gradual dénouement yields up an unsuspected order influenced the organisation of charles darwins on the origin of species168 influence and legacy dickens and little nell statue in philadelphia pennsylvania museums and festivals celebrating dickenss life and works exist in many places with which dickens was associated these include the charles dickens museum in london the historic home where he wrote oliver twist the pickwick papers and nicholas nickleby and the charles dickens birthplace museum in portsmouth the house in which he was born the original manuscripts of many of his novels as well as printers proofs first editions and illustrations from the collection of dickenss friend john forster are held at the victoria and albert museum169 dickenss will stipulated that no memorial be erected in his honour nonetheless a lifesize bronze statue of dickens entitled dickens and little nell cast in 1891 by francis edwin elwell stands in clark park in the spruce hill neighbourhood of philadelphia pennsylvania another lifesize statue of dickens is located at centennial park sydney australia170 in 2014 a lifesize statue was unveiled near his birthplace in portsmouth on the 202nd anniversary of his birth this was supported by the authors greatgreat grandsons ian and gerald dickens171172 dickens was commemorated on the series e £10 note issued by the bank of england that circulated between 1992 and 2003 his portrait appeared on the reverse of the note accompanied by a scene from the pickwick papers the charles dickens school is a high school in
