different styles in the 1960s and later particularly in the united kingdom and the united states12 it has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll a style which drew heavily on the africanamerican genres of blues and rhythm and blues and from country music rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk and incorporated influences from jazz classical and other musical styles musically rock has centered on the electric guitar usually as part of a rock group with electric bass and drums and one or more singers typically rock is songbased music usually with a 44 time signature using a verse–chorus form but the genre has become extremely diverse like pop music lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political by the late 1960s classic rock1 period a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged including hybrids like blues rock folk rock country rock raga rock and jazzrock many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene new genres that emerged included progressive rock which extended the artistic elements glam rock which highlighted showmanship and visual style and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal which emphasized volume power and speed in the second half of the 1970s punk rock reacted by producing strippeddown energetic social and political critiques punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave postpunk and eventually alternative rock from the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge britpop and indie rock further fusion subgenres have since emerged including pop punk rap rock and rap metal as well as conscious attempts to revisit rocks history including the garage rockpostpunk and synthpop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s decade rock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements leading to major subcultures including mods and rockers in the uk and the hippie counterculture that spread out from san francisco in the us in

characteristicsedit “ a good definition of rock in fact is that its popular music that to a certain degree doesnt care if its popular ” —  vulturecom3 red hot chili peppers in 2006 showing a quartet lineup for a rock band from left to right bassist lead vocalist drummer and guitarist the sound of rock is traditionally centered on the amplified electric guitar which emerged in its modern form in the 1950s with the popularization of rock and roll4 and was influenced by the sounds of electric blues guitarists5 the sound of an electric guitar in rock music is typically supported by an electric bass guitar which pioneered in jazz music in the same era6 and percussion produced from a drum kit that combines drums and cymbals7 this trio of instruments has often been complemented by the inclusion of other instruments particularly keyboards such as the piano hammond organ and synthesizers8 the basic rock instrumentation was adapted from the basic blues band instrumentation prominent lead guitar second chordal instrument bass and drums5 a group of musicians performing rock music is termed a rock band or rock group and typically consists of between three–the power trio–and five members classically a rock band takes the form of a quartet whose members cover one or more roles including vocalist lead guitarist rhythm guitarist bass guitarist drummer and often that of keyboard player or other instrumentalist9 rock music is traditionally built on a foundation of simple unsyncopated rhythms in a 44 meter with a repetitive snare drum back beat on beats two and four10 melodies are often derived from older musical modes including the dorian and mixolydian as well as major and minor modes harmonies range from the common triad to parallel fourths and fifths and dissonant harmonic progressions10 rock songs since the late 1950s11 and particularly from the mid1960s onwards often used the versechorus structure derived from blues and folk music but there has been considerable variation from this model12 critics have stressed the eclecticism and stylistic diversity of rock13 because of its complex history and tendency to borrow from other musical and cultural forms it has been argued that it is impossible to bind rock music to a rigidly delineated musical definition14 a simple 44 drum pattern common in rock music  play help·info unlike many earlier styles of popular music rock lyrics have dealt with a wide range of themes in addition to romantic love including sex rebellion against the establishment social concerns and life styles10 these themes were inherited from a variety of sources including the tin pan alley pop tradition folk music and rhythm and blues15 music journalist robert christgau characterizes rock lyrics as a cool medium with simple diction and repeated refrains and asserts that rocks primary function pertains to music or more generally noise16 the predominance of white male and often middle class musicians in rock music has often been noted17 and rock has been seen as an appropriation of black musical forms for a young white and largely male audience18 as a result it has been seen as articulating the concerns of this group in both style and lyrics19 christgau writing in 1972 said in spite of some exceptions rock and roll usually implies an identification of male sexuality and aggression20 since the term rock began to be used in preference to rock and roll from the late1960s it has often been contrasted with pop music with which it has shared many characteristics but from which it is often distanced by an emphasis on musicianship live performance and a focus on serious and progressive themes as part of an ideology of authenticity that is frequently combined with an awareness of the genres history and development21 according to simon frith rock was something more than pop something more than rock and roll rock musicians combined an emphasis on skill and technique with the romantic concept of art as artistic expression original and sincere21 in the new millennium the term rock has sometimes been used as a blanket term including forms such as pop music reggae music soul music and even hip hop with which it has been influenced but often contrasted through much of its history22 1950s rock and rolledit main article rock and roll see also origins of rock and roll and rockabilly the foundations of rock music are in rock and roll which originated in the united states during the late 1940s and early 1950s and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world its immediate origins lay in a melding of various black musical genres of the time including rhythm and blues and gospel music with country and western23 in 1951 cleveland ohio disc jockey alan freed began playing rhythm and blues music then termed race music for a multiracial audience and is credited with first using the phrase rock and roll to describe the music24 debate surrounds which record should be considered the first rock

roll song to top billboard magazines main sales and airplay charts and opened the door worldwide for this new wave of popular culture2829 elvis presley in a promotion shot for jailhouse rock in 1957 it has also been argued that thats all right mama 1954 elvis presleys first single for sun records in memphis could be the first rock and roll record30 but at the same time big joe turners shake rattle roll later covered by haley was already at the top of the billboard rb charts other artists with early rock and roll hits included chuck berry bo diddley fats domino little richard jerry lee lewis and gene vincent27 soon rock and roll was the major force in american record sales and crooners such as eddie fisher perry como and patti page who had dominated the previous decade of popular music found their access to the pop charts significantly curtailed31 rock and roll has been seen as leading to a number of distinct subgenres including rockabilly combining rock and roll with hillbilly country music which was usually played and recorded in the mid1950s by white singers such as carl perkins jerry lee lewis buddy holly and with the greatest commercial success elvis presley32 in contrast doo wop placed an emphasis on multipart vocal harmonies and meaningless backing lyrics from which the genre later gained its name which were usually supported with light instrumentation and had its origins in 1930s and 1940s african american vocal groups33 acts like the crows the penguins the el dorados and the turbans all scored major hits and groups like the platters with songs including the great pretender 195534 and the coasters with humorous songs like yakety yak 195835 ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the period36 the era also saw the growth in popularity of the electric guitar and the development of a specifically rock and roll style of playing through such exponents as chuck berry link wray and scotty moore37 the use of distortion pioneered by electric blues guitarists such as guitar slim38 willie johnson and pat hare in the early 1950s39 was popularized by chuck berry in the mid1950s40 the use of power chords pioneered by

britain42 lonnie donegans 1955 hit rock island line was a major influence and helped to develop the trend of skiffle music groups throughout the country many of which including john lennons quarrymen moved on to play rock and roll43 commentators have traditionally perceived a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s by 1959 the death of buddy holly the big bopper and richie valens in a plane crash the departure of elvis for the army the retirement of little richard to become a preacher prosecutions of jerry lee lewis and chuck berry and the breaking of the payola scandal which implicated major figures including alan freed in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs gave a sense that the rock and roll era established at that point had come to an

alternative to rock and roll4546 from about 1967 it was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock music to describe a form that was more commercial ephemeral and accessible21 in contrast rock music was seen as focusing on extended works particularly albums was often associated with particular subcultures like the counterculture of the 1960s placed an emphasis on artistic values and authenticity stressed live performance and instrumental or vocal virtuosity and was often seen as encapsulating progressive developments rather than simply reflecting existing trends21454647

innovations and trends in this period without which future developments would not have been possible5253 while early rock and roll particularly through the advent of rockabilly saw the greatest commercial success for male and white performers in this era the genre was dominated by black and female artists rock and roll had not disappeared at the end of the 1950s and some of its energy can be seen in the twist dance craze of the early 1960s mainly benefiting the career of chubby checker53nb 2 cliff richard had the first british rock and roll hit with move it effectively ushering in the

british rock groups at clubs and local dances heavily influenced by bluesrock pioneers like alexis korner were starting to play with an intensity and drive seldom found in white american acts58 also significant was the advent of soul music as a major commercial force developing out of rhythm and blues with a reinjection of gospel music and pop led by pioneers like ray charles and sam cooke from the mid1950s59 by the early 1960s figures like marvin gaye james brown aretha franklin curtis mayfield and stevie wonder were dominating the rb charts and breaking through into the main pop charts helping to accelerate their desegregation while motown and staxvolt records were becoming major forces in the record industry60nb 3 some historians of musicweasel words have also pointed to important

both instrumental surf rock among them covers of music by dick dale and vocal songs drawing on rock and roll and doo wop and the close harmonies of vocal pop acts like the four freshmencitation needed their first chart hit surfin in 1962 reached the billboard top 100 and helped make the surf music craze a national phenomenon64 the surf music craze and the careers of almost all surf acts was

blues and surf music65 initially reinterpreting standard american tunes and playing for dancers bands like the animals from newcastle and them from belfast66 and particularly those from london like the rolling stones and the yardbirds were much more directly influenced by rhythm and blues and later blues music67 soon these groups were composing their own material combining us forms of music and infusing it with a high energy beat beat bands tended towards bouncy irresistible melodies while early british blues acts tended towards less sexually innocent more aggressive songs often adopting an antiestablishment stance there was however particularly in the early stages considerable musical crossover between the two tendencies68 by 1963 led by the beatles beat groups had begun to achieve national success in britain soon to be followed into the charts by the more rhythm and blues focused acts69 i want to hold your hand was the beatles first number 1 hit on the billboard hot 10070

including the entire top five the beatles went on to become the biggest selling rock band of all time and they were followed into the us charts by numerous british bands68 during the next two years

rolling stones74 the troggs and donovan75 all having one or more number one singles71 other major acts that were part of the invasion included the kinks and the dave clark five7677 the british invasion helped internationalize the production of rock and roll opening the door for subsequent british and irish performers to achieve international success78 in america it arguably spelled the end of instrumental surf music vocal girl groups and for a time the teen idols that had dominated the american charts in the late 1950s and 1960s79 it dented the careers of established rb acts like fats domino and chubby checker and even temporarily derailed the chart success of surviving rock and roll acts including elvis80 the british invasion also played a major part in the rise of a distinct genre of rock music and cemented the primacy of the rock group based on guitars and drums and producing their own material as singersongwriters33 garage rockedit main article garage rock garage rock was a raw form of rock music particularly prevalent in north america in the mid1960s and so called because of the perception that it was rehearsed in the suburban family garage8182 garage rock songs often revolved around the traumas of high school life with songs about lying girls being particularly common83 the lyrics and delivery tended to be more aggressive than was common at the time often with growled or shouted vocals that dissolved into incoherent screaming81 they ranged from crude onechord music like the seeds to nearstudio musician quality including the knickerbockers the remains

billboard hot 10089 the british invasion greatly influenced garage bands providing them with a national audience leading many often surf or hot rod groups to adopt a british influence and encouraging many more groups to form83 thousands of garage bands were extant in the us and canada during the era and hundreds produced regional hits83 despite scores of bands being signed to major or large regional labels most were commercial failures it is generally agreed that garage rock peaked both commercially and artistically around 196683 by 1968 the style largely disappeared from the national charts and at the local level as amateur musicians faced college work or the draft83 new styles had evolved to replace garage rock83nb 5 psychedelia and progressivismedit blues and folk fusionsedit

wave of bands that drew their inspiration more directly from american blues including the rolling stones and the yardbirds91 british blues musicians of the late 1950s and early 1960s had been inspired by the acoustic playing of figures such as lead belly who was a major influence on the skiffle craze and robert johnson92 increasingly they adopted a loud amplified sound often centered on the electric guitar based on the chicago blues particularly after the tour of britain by muddy waters in 1958 which prompted cyril davies and guitarist alexis korner to form the band blues incorporated93

yardbirds and later peter green particularly significant was the release of blues breakers with eric clapton beano album 1966 considered one of the seminal british blues recordings and the sound of which was much emulated in both britain and the united states94 eric clapton went on to form supergroups cream blind faith and derek and the dominos followed by an extensive solo career that helped bring blues rock into the mainstream93 green along with the bluesbreakers rhythm section mick fleetwood and john mcvie formed peter greens fleetwood mac who enjoyed some of the greatest commercial success in the genre93 in the late 1960s jeff beck also an alumnus of the yardbirds moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band the jeff beck group93 the last yardbirds guitarist was jimmy page who went on to form the new yardbirds which rapidly became led zeppelin many of the songs on their first three albums and occasionally later in their careers were expansions on traditional blues songs93 in america blues rock had been pioneered in the early 1960s by guitarist lonnie mack95 but the genre began to take off in the mid1960s as acts developed a sound similar to british blues

joplin johnny winter the j geils band and jimi hendrix with his power trios the jimi hendrix experience and band of gypsys whose guitar virtuosity and showmanship would be among the most emulated of the decade93 blues rock bands from the southern states like the allman brothers band lynyrd skynyrd and zz top incorporated country elements into their style to produce distinctive southern rock96 early blues rock bands often emulated jazz playing long involved improvisations which would later be a major element of progressive rock from about 1967 bands like cream and the jimi hendrix experience had moved away from purely bluesbased music into psychedelia97 by the 1970s blues rock had become heavier and more riffbased exemplified by the work of led zeppelin and deep purple and the lines between blues rock and hard rock were barely visible97 as bands began recording rockstyle albums97 the genre was continued in the 1970s by figures such as george thorogood and pat travers93 but particularly on the british scene except perhaps for the advent of groups such as status quo and foghat who moved towards a form of high energy and repetitive boogie rock bands became focused on heavy

revival had grown to a major movement utilising traditional music and new compositions in a traditional style usually on acoustic instruments99 in america the genre was pioneered by figures such as woody guthrie and pete seeger and often identified with progressive or labor politics99 in the early sixties figures such as joan baez and bob dylan had come to the fore in this movement as singersongwriters100 dylan had begun to reach a mainstream audience with hits including blowin in the wind 1963 and masters of war 1963 which brought protest songs to a wider public101 but although beginning to influence each other rock and folk music had remained largely separate genres often with mutually exclusive audiences102 early attempts to combine elements of folk and rock included the animals house of the rising sun 1964 which was the first commercially successful folk song to be recorded with rock and roll instrumentation103 and the beatles im a loser 1964 arguably the first beatles song to be influenced directly by dylan104 the folk rock movement is usually thought to have taken off with the byrds recording of dylans mr tambourine man which topped the charts in 1965102 with members who had been part of the cafebased folk scene in los angeles the byrds adopted rock instrumentation including drums and 12string rickenbacker guitars which became a major element in the sound of the genre102 later that year dylan adopted electric instruments much to the outrage of many folk purists with his like a rolling stone becoming a us hit single102 folk rock particularly took off in california where it led acts like the mamas the papas and crosby stills and nash to move to electric instrumentation and in new york where it spawned performers including the lovin spoonful and simon and garfunkel with the latters acoustic the sounds of silence 1965 being remixed with rock instruments to be the first of many hits102 these acts directly influenced british performers like donovan and fairport convention102 in 1969 fairport convention abandoned their mixture of american covers and dylaninfluenced songs to play traditional english folk music on electric instruments105 this british folk rock was taken up by bands including pentangle steeleye span and the albion band which in turn prompted irish groups like horslips and scottish acts like the jsd band spencers feat and later five hand reel to use their traditional music to create a brand of celtic rock in the early 1970s106 folk rock reached its peak of commercial popularity in the period 1967–68 before many acts moved off in a variety of directions including dylan and the byrds who began to develop country rock107 however the hybridization of folk and rock has been seen as having a major influence on the development of rock music bringing in elements of psychedelia and helping to develop the ideas of the singersongwriter the protest song and concepts of authenticity102108 psychedelic rockedit main

crimson king which mixed powerful guitar riffs and mellotron with jazz and symphonic music is often taken as the key recording in progressive rock helping the widespread adoption of the genre in the early 1970s among existing bluesrock and psychedelic bands as well as newly formed acts113 the vibrant canterbury scene saw acts following soft machine from psychedelia through jazz influences toward more expansive hard rock including caravan hatfield and the north gong and national health118 greater commercial success was enjoyed by pink floyd who also moved away from psychedelia after the departure of syd barrett in 1968 with the dark side of the moon 1973 seen as a masterpiece of the genre becoming one of the bestselling albums of all time119 there was an emphasis on instrumental

coming from the rock side of the equation jazz rock generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late 60s and early 70s including the singersongwriter movement128 many

blonde133 this and subsequent more clearly countryinfluenced albums have been seen as creating the genre of country folk a route pursued by a number of largely acoustic folk musicians133 other acts that followed the backtobasics trend were the canadian group the band and the californiabased creedence clearwater revival both of which mixed basic rock and roll with folk country and blues to be among the most successful and influential bands of the late 1960s134 the same movement saw the beginning of the recording careers of californian solo artists like ry cooder bonnie raitt and lowell

founders of southern rock are usually thought to be the allman brothers band who developed a distinctive sound largely derived from blues rock but incorporating elements of boogie soul and country in the early 1970s96 the most successful act to follow them were lynyrd skynyrd who helped establish the good ol boy image of the subgenre and the general shape of 1970s guitar rock96 their successors

rock of roxy music and can be seen as much as a fashion as a musical subgenre139 visually it was a mesh of various styles ranging from 1930s hollywood glamor through 1950s pinup sex appeal prewar cabaret theatrics victorian literary and symbolist styles science fiction to ancient and occult mysticism and mythology manifesting itself in outrageous clothes makeup hairstyles and platformsoled boots140 glam is most noted for its sexual and gender ambiguity and representations of androgyny beside extensive use of theatrics141 it was prefigured by the showmanship and genderidentity manipulation of american acts such as the cockettes and alice cooper142 the origins of glam rock are associated with marc bolan who had renamed his folk duo to t rex and taken up electric instruments by the end of the 1960s often cited as the moment of inception is his appearance on the uk tv programme top of the pops in december 1970 wearing glitter to perform what would be his first number 1

performers were soon followed in the style by acts including roxy music sweet slade mott the hoople mud and alvin stardust144 while highly successful in the single charts in the uk very few of these musicians were able to make a serious impact in the united states bowie was the major exception becoming an international superstar and prompting the adoption of glam styles among acts like lou reed iggy pop new york dolls and jobriath often known as glitter rock and with a darker lyrical content than their british counterparts145 in the uk the term glitter rock was most often used to refer to the extreme version of glam pursued by gary glitter and his support musicians the glitter band who between them achieved eighteen top ten singles in the uk between 1972 and 1976146 a second wave of glam rock acts including suzi quatro roy woods wizzard and sparks dominated the british single charts from about 1974 to 1976144 existing acts some not usually considered central to the genre also adopted glam styles including rod stewart elton john queen and for a time even the rolling stones144 it was also a direct influence on acts that rose to prominence later including kiss and adam ant and less directly on the formation of gothic rock and glam metal as well as on punk rock which helped end the fashion for glam from about 1976145 glam has since enjoyed sporadic modest revivals

commercial peak in the mid to late 1970s with acts like billy joel america and the reformed fleetwood mac whose rumours 1977 was the bestselling album of the decade150 in contrast hard rock was more often derived from bluesrock and was played louder and with more intensity151 it often emphasised the electric guitar both as a rhythm instrument using simple repetitive riffs and as a solo lead instrument and was more likely to be used with distortion and other effects151 key acts included british invasion bands like the kinks as well as psychedelic era performers like cream jimi hendrix and the jeff beck group151 hard rockinfluenced bands that enjoyed international success in the later 1970s included queen152 thin lizzy153 aerosmith acdc151 and van halen from the late 1960s the term

characteristic sounds and styles which would help shape the subgenre led zeppelin added elements of fantasy to their riff laden bluesrock deep purple brought in symphonic and medieval interests from their progressive rock phase and black sabbath introduced facets of the gothic and modal harmony helping to produce a darker sound156 these elements were taken up by a second generation of heavy metal bands into the late 1970s including judas priest ufo motörhead and rainbow from britain kiss ted nugent and blue öyster cult from the us rush from canada and scorpions from germany all marking the

particularly popular in the united states160 many christian rock performers have ties to the contemporary christian music scene while other bands and artists are closely linked to independent music since the 1980s christian rock performers have gained mainstream success including figures such as the american gospeltopop crossover artist amy grant and the british singer cliff richard161 while these artists were largely acceptable in christian communities the adoption of heavy rock and glam metal styles by bands like petra and stryper who achieved considerable mainstream success in the

they created fast hardedged music typically with short songs strippeddown instrumentation and often political antiestablishment lyrics punk embraces a diy do it yourself ethic with many bands selfproducing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels166 by late 1976 acts such as the ramones and patti smith in new york city and the sex pistols and the clash in london were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement165 the following year saw punk rock spreading around the world punk quickly though briefly became a major cultural phenomenon in the united kingdom for the most part punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream an associated punk subculture emerged expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive clothing styles and a variety of antiauthoritarian ideologies167 by the beginning of the 1980s faster more aggressive styles such as hardcore and oi had become the predominant mode of punk rock168 this has resulted in several evolved strains of hardcore punk such as dbeat a distortionheavy subgenre influenced by the uk band discharge anarchopunk such as crass grindcore such as napalm

approach such as talking heads and devo began to infiltrate the punk scene in some quarters the description new wave began to be used to differentiate these less overtly punk bands172 record executives who had been mostly mystified by the punk movement recognized the potential of the more accessible new wave acts and began aggressively signing and marketing any band that could claim a remote connection to punk or new wave173 many of these bands such as the cars and the gogos can be seen as pop bands marketed as new wave174 other existing acts including the police the pretenders and elvis costello used the new wave movement as the springboard for relatively long and critically successful careers175 while skinny tie bands exemplified by the knack176 or the photogenic blondie began as punk acts and moved into more commercial territory177 between 1979 and 1985 influenced by kraftwerk yellow magic orchestra david bowie and gary numan british new wave went in the direction of such new romantics as spandau ballet ultravox japan duran duran a flock of seagulls culture club talk talk and the eurythmics sometimes using the synthesizer to replace all other instruments178 this period coincided with the rise of mtv and led to a great deal of exposure for this brand of synthpop creating what has been characterised as a second british invasion179 some more traditional rock bands

challenging side major influences beside punk bands were the velvet underground frank zappa and captain beefheart and the new yorkbased no wave scene which placed an emphasis on performance including bands such as james chance and the contortions dna and sonic youth182 early contributors to the genre included the us bands pere ubu devo the residents and talking heads182 the first wave of british postpunk included gang of four siouxsie and the banshees and joy division who placed less emphasis on art than their us counterparts and more on the dark emotional qualities of their music182 bands like siouxsie and the banshees bauhaus the cure and the sisters of mercy moved increasingly in this direction to found gothic rock which had become the basis of a major subculture by the early 1980s183 similar emotional territory was pursued by australian acts like the birthday party and nick cave182 members of bauhaus and joy division explored new stylistic territory as love and rockets and new order respectively182 another early postpunk movement was the industrial music184 developed by british bands throbbing gristle and cabaret voltaire and new yorkbased suicide using a variety of electronic and sampling techniques that emulated the sound of industrial production and which would develop into a variety of forms of postindustrial music in the 1980s185 the second generation of british postpunk bands that broke through in the early 1980s including the fall the pop group the mekons echo and the bunnymen and the teardrop explodes tended to move away from dark sonic landscapes182 arguably the most successful band to emerge from postpunk was irelands u2 who incorporated elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music and by the late 1980s had become one of the biggest bands in the world186 although many postpunk bands continued to record and perform it declined as a movement in the mid1980s as acts disbanded

midwest and rust belt counterpart to west coast country rock and the southern rock of the american south189 led by figures who had initially been identified with punk and new wave it was most strongly influenced by acts such as bob dylan the byrds creedence clearwater revival and van morrison and the basic rock of 1960s garage and the rolling stones190 exemplified by the commercial success of singer songwriters bruce springsteen bob seger and tom petty along with less widely known acts such as southside johnny and the asbury jukes and joe grushecky and the houserockers it was partly a reaction to postindustrial urban decline in the east and midwest often dwelling on issues of social disintegration and isolation beside a form of goodtime rock and roll revivalism190 the genre reached its commercial artistic and influential peak in the mid1980s with springsteens born in the usa 1984 topping the charts worldwide and spawning a series of top ten singles together with the arrival of

audiences and as heartlands artists turned to more personal works190 many heartland rock artists continue to record today with critical and commercial success most notably bruce springsteen tom petty and john mellencamp although their works have become more personal and experimental and no longer fit easily into a single genre newer artists whose music would perhaps have been labelled heartland

descriptive of the dirty sound of the music and the unkempt appearance of most musicians who actively rebelled against the overgroomed images of other artists204 grunge fused elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a single sound and made heavy use of guitar distortion fuzz and feedback204 the lyrics were typically apathetic and angstfilled and often concerned themes such as social alienation and entrapment although it was also known for its dark humor and parodies of commercial rock204 bands such as green river soundgarden melvins and skin yard pioneered the genre with mudhoney

partly as a reaction against various us based musical and cultural trends in the late 1980s and early 1990s particularly the grunge phenomenon and as a reassertion of a british rock identity196 britpop was varied in style but often used catchy tunes and hooks beside lyrics with particularly british concerns and the adoption of the iconography of the 1960s british invasion including the symbols of british identity previously utilised by the mods209 it was launched around 1992 with releases by groups such as suede and blur who were soon joined by others including oasis pulp supergrass and elastica who produced a series of top ten albums and singles196 for a while the contest between blur and oasis was built by the popular press into the battle of britpop initially won by blur but with oasis achieving greater longterm and international success directly influencing a third generation of britpop bands including the boo radleys ocean colour scene and cast210 britpop groups brought british alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the backbone of a larger british cultural movement known as cool britannia211 although its more popular bands particularly blur and oasis were

rock and hip hop among other influences234236 among the first wave of performers to gain mainstream success as rap rock were 311237 bloodhound gang238 and kid rock239 a more metallic sound – nu metal – was pursued by bands including limp bizkit korn and slipknot234 later in the decade this style which contained a mix of grunge punk metal rap and turntable scratching spawned a wave of successful bands like linkin park pod and staind who were often classified as rap metal or nu metal the first of which are the bestselling band of the genre240 in 2001 nu metal reached its peak with albums like stainds break the cycle pods satellite slipknots iowa and linkin parks hybrid theory new bands also emerged like disturbed godsmack and papa roach whose major label début infest became a platinum hit241 korns longawaited fifth album untouchables and papa roachs second album lovehatetragedy did not sell as well as their previous releases while nu metal bands were played more infrequently on rock radio stations and mtv began focusing on pop punk and emo242 since then many bands have changed to a more conventional hard rock heavy metal or electronic music sound242 postbritpopedit main article postbritpop coldplay in 2008 from about 1997 as dissatisfaction grew with the concept of cool britannia and britpop as a movement began to dissolve emerging bands began to avoid the britpop label while still producing music derived from it243244 many of these bands tended to mix elements of british traditional rock or british trad rock245 particularly the beatles rolling stones and small faces246 with american influences including postgrunge247248 drawn from across the united kingdom with several important bands emerging from the north of england scotland wales and northern ireland the themes of their music tended to be less parochially centered on british english and london life and more introspective than had been the case with britpop at its height249250 this beside a greater willingness to engage with the american press and fans may have helped some of them in achieving international success251 post britpop bands have been seen as presenting the image of the rock star as an ordinary person and their increasingly melodic music was criticised for being bland or derivative252 post britpop bands like the verve with urban hymns 1997 radiohead from ok computer 1997 travis from the man who 1999 stereophonics from performance and cocktails 1999 feeder from echo park 2001 and particularly coldplay from their debut album parachutes 2000 achieved much wider international success than most of the britpop groups that had preceded them and were some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s arguably providing a launchpad for the subsequent garage rock or postpunk revival which has also been seen as a reaction to their introspective brand of rock248253254255 2000s–presentedit this section gives

emoedit main articles posthardcore and emo see also screamo posthardcore developed in the us particularly in the chicago and washington dc areas in the early to mid1980s with bands that were inspired by the doityourself ethics and guitarheavy music of hardcore punk but influenced by postpunk adopting longer song formats more complex musical structures and sometimes more melodic vocal styles256 emo also emerged from the hardcore scene in 1980s washington dc initially as emocore used as a term to describe bands who favored expressive vocals over the more common abrasive barking style257 the early emo scene operated as an underground with shortlived bands releasing smallrun vinyl records on tiny independent labels257 emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinumselling success of jimmy eat worlds bleed american 2001 and dashboard confessionals the places you have come to fear the most 2003258 the new emo had a much more mainstream sound than in the 1990s and a far greater appeal amongst adolescents than its earlier incarnations258 at the same time use of the term emo expanded beyond the musical genre becoming associated with fashion a hairstyle and any music that expressed emotion259 by 2003 posthardcore bands had also caught the attention of major labels and began to enjoy mainstream success in the album chartscitation needed a number of these bands were seen as a more aggressive offshoot of emo and given the often vague label of screamo260 garage rockpostpunk revivaledit main articles garage rock revival and postpunk revival the strokes performing in 2006 in the early 2000s a new group of bands that played a stripped down and backtobasics version of guitar rock emerged into the mainstream they were variously characterised as part of a garage rock postpunk or new wave revival261262263264 because the bands came from across the globe cited diverse influences from traditional blues through new wave to grunge and adopted differing styles of dress their unity as a genre has been disputed265 there had been attempts to revive garage rock and elements of punk in the 1980s and 1990s and by 2000 scenes had grown up in several countries266 the commercial breakthrough from these scenes was led by four bands the strokes who emerged from the new york club scene with their début album is this it 2001 the white stripes from detroit with their third album white blood cells 2001 the hives from sweden after their compilation album your new favourite band 2001 and the vines from australia with highly evolved 2002267 they were christened by the media as the the bands and dubbed the saviours of rock n roll leading to accusations of hype268 a second wave of bands that gained international recognition due to the movement included black rebel motorcycle club the killers interpol and kings of leon from the us269 the libertines arctic monkeys bloc party editors franz ferdinand and placebo from the uk270 jet from australia271 and the datsuns and the d4 from new zealand272 digital electronic rockedit main article electronic rock see also laptronica indietronica electroclash dancepunk new rave and synthpop in the 2000s as computer technology became more accessible and music software advanced it became possible to create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer273 this resulted in a massive increase in the amount of homeproduced electronic music available to the general public via the expanding internet274 and new forms of performance such as laptronica273 and live coding275 these techniques also began to be used by existing bands and by developing genres that mixed rock with digital techniques and sounds including indie electronic electroclash dancepunk and new ravecitation needed social impactedit main article social effects of rock music different subgenres of rock were adopted by and became central to the identity of a large number of subcultures in the 1950s and 1960s respectively british youths adopted the teddy boy and rocker subcultures which revolved around us rock and roll276 the counterculture of the 1960s was closely associated with psychedelic rock276 the mid1970s punk subculture began in the us but it was given a distinctive look by british designer vivienne westwood a look which spread worldwide277 out of the punk scene the goth and emo subcultures grew both of which presented distinctive visual styles278 the 1969 woodstock festival was seen as a celebration of the countercultural lifestyle when an international rock culture developed it supplanted cinema as the major sources of fashion influence279 paradoxically followers of rock music have often mistrusted the world of fashion which has been seen as elevating image above substance279 rock fashions have been seen as combining elements of different cultures and periods as well as expressing divergent views on sexuality and gender and rock music in general has been noted and criticised for facilitating greater sexual freedom279280 rock has also been associated with various forms of drug use including the amphetamines taken by mods in the early to mid1960s through the lsd mescaline hashish and other hallucinogenic drugs linked with psychedelic rock in the late 1960s and early 1970s and sometimes to cannabis cocaine and heroin all of which have been eulogised in song281282 rock has been credited with changing attitudes to race by opening up africanamerican culture to white audiences but at the same time rock has been accused of appropriating and exploiting that culture283284 while rock music has absorbed many influences and introduced western audiences to different musical traditions285 the global spread of rock music has been interpreted as a form of cultural imperialism286 rock music inherited the folk tradition of protest song making political statements on subjects such as war religion poverty civil rights justice and the environment287 political activism reached a mainstream peak with the do they know its christmas single 1984 and live aid concert for ethiopia in 1985 which while successfully raising awareness of world poverty and funds for aid have also been criticised along with similar events for providing a stage for selfaggrandisement and increased profits for the rock stars involved288 since its early development rock music has been associated with rebellion against social and political norms most obviously in early rock and rolls rejection of an adultdominated culture the countercultures rejection of consumerism and conformity and punks rejection of all forms of social convention289 however it can also be seen as providing a means of commercial exploitation of such ideas and of diverting youth away from political action290 role of womenedit main article women in music § popular music suzi quatro is a singer bassist and bandleader when she launched her career in 1973 she was one of the few prominent women instrumentalists and bandleaders professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in rock genres such as heavy metal according to schaap and berkers playing in a band is largely a male homosocial activity that is learning to play in a band is largely a peerbased experience shaped by existing sexsegregated friendship networks291 they note that rock music is often defined as a form of male rebellion visàvis female bedroom culture292 in popular music there has been a gendered distinction between public male and private female participation in music292 several scholars have argued that men exclude women from bands or from the bands rehearsals recordings performances and other social activities293 women are mainly regarded as passive and private consumers of allegedly slick prefabricated – hence inferior – pop music excluding them from participating as high status rock musicians293 one of the reasons that there are rarely mixed gender bands is that bands operate as tightknit units in which homosocial solidarity – social bonds between people of the same sex – plays a crucial role293 in the 1960s rock music scene singing was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl but playing an instrument simply wasnt done294 the rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion the women – often in the 1950s and 60s girls in their teens – in rock usually sang songs as personæ utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends philip auslander says that although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s most performed only as singers a traditionally feminine position in popular music though some women played instruments in american allfemale garage rock bands none of these bands achieved more than regional success so they did not provide viable templates for womens ongoing participation in rock295 in relation to the gender composition of heavy metal bands it has been said that heavy metal performers are almost exclusively male296 at least until the mid1980s297 apart from exceptions such as girlschool296 however now in the 2010s maybe more than ever–strong metal women have put up their dukes and got down to it298 carving out a considerable place for themselves299 when suzi quatro emerged in 1973 no other prominent female musician worked in rock simultaneously as a singer instrumentalist songwriter and bandleader295 according to auslander she was kicking down the male door in rock and roll and proving that a female musician  and this is a point i am extremely concerned about  could play as well if not better than the boys295 an allfemale band is a musical group in genres such as rock and blues which is exclusively composed of female musicians this is distinct from a girl group in which the female members are solely vocalists though this terminology is not universally followed300 see alsoedit rock music portal rock music – wikipedia book notesedit the terms poprock and power pop have been used to describe more commercially successful music that uses elements from or the form of rock music48 poprock has been defined as an upbeat variety of rock music represented by artists such as elton john paul mccartney the everly brothers rod stewart chicago and peter frampton49 the term power pop was coined by pete townshend of the who in 1966 but not much used until it was applied to bands like badfinger in the 1970s who proved some of the most commercially successful of the period50 having died down in the late 1950s doo wop enjoyed a revival in the same period with hits for acts like the marcels the capris maurice williams and the zodiacs and shep and the limelights36 the rise of girl groups like the chantels the shirelles and the crystals placed an emphasis on harmonies and polished production that was in contrast to earlier rock and roll54 some of the most significant girl group hits were products of the brill building sound named after the block in new york where many songwriters were based which included the number 1 hit for the shirelles will you love me tomorrow in 1960 penned by the partnership of gerry goffin and carole king55 all of these elements including the close harmonies of doo wop and girl groups the carefully crafted songwriting of the brill building sound and the polished production values of soul have been seen as influencing the merseybeat sound particularly the early work of the beatles and through them the form of later rock music61 only the beach boys were able to sustain a creative career into the mid1960s producing a string of hit singles and albums including the highly regarded pet sounds in 1966 which made them arguably the only american rock or pop act that could rival the beatles64 in detroit garage rocks legacy remained alive into the early 1970s with bands such as the mc5 and the stooges who employed a much more aggressive approach to the form these bands began to be labelled punk rock and are now often seen as protopunk or protohard rock90 referencesedit a b w e studwell and d f
