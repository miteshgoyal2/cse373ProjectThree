northrop grumman e10 mc2a the boeing 767 is a mid to largesize mid to longrange widebody twinengine jet airliner built by boeing commercial airplanes it was boeings first widebody twinjet and its first airliner with a twocrew glass cockpit the aircraft has two turbofan engines a conventional tail and for reduced aerodynamic drag a supercritical wing design designed as a smaller widebody airliner than earlier aircraft such as the 747 the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 people and a design range of 3850 to 6385 nautical miles 7130 to 11825 km depending on variant development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrowbody twinjet the 757 resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft the 767 is produced in three fuselage lengths the original 767200 entered service in 1982 followed by the 767300 in 1986 and the 767400er an extendedrange er variant in 2000 the extendedrange 767200er and 767300er models entered service in 1984 and 1988 respectively while a production freighter version the 767300f debuted in 1995 conversion programs have modified passenger 767200 and 767300 series aircraft for cargo use while military derivatives include the e767 surveillance aircraft the kc767 and kc46 aerial tankers and vip transports engines featured on the 767 include the general electric cf6 pratt whitney jt9d and pw4000 and rollsroyce rb211 turbofans united airlines first placed the 767 in commercial service in 1982 the aircraft was initially flown on domestic and transcontinental routes during which it demonstrated the reliability of its twinjet design in 1985 the 767 became the first twinengined airliner to receive regulatory approval for extended overseas flights the aircraft was then used to expand nonstop service on medium to longhaul intercontinental routes in 1986 boeing initiated studies for a highercapacity 767 ultimately leading to the development of the 777 a larger widebody twinjet in the 1990s the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for transatlantic flights between north america and europe the 767 is the first twinjet widebody type to reach 1000 aircraft delivered as of september 2017 boeing has received 1204 orders for the 767 from 74 customers 1103 have been delivered1 a total of 742 of these aircraft were in service in july 2016 the most popular variant is the 767300er with 583 delivered delta air lines is the largest operator with 91 aircraft competitors have included the airbus a300 a310 and a330200 while a successor the 787 dreamliner

was the first passenger jet wide enough to feature a twinaisle cabin4 two years later the manufacturer began a development study codenamed 7x7 for a new widebody aircraft intended to replace the 707 and other early generation narrowbody jets56 the aircraft would also provide twinaisle seating but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747 mcdonnell douglas dc10 and lockheed l1011 tristar widebodies5 to defray the high cost of development boeing signed risksharing agreements with italian corporation aeritalia and the civil transport development corporation ctdc a consortium of japanese aerospace companies7 this marked the manufacturers first major international joint venture and both aeritalia and the ctdc received supply contracts in return for their early participation7 the initial 7x7 was conceived as a short takeoff and landing airliner intended for shortdistance flights but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept leading to its redefinition as a midsize transcontinentalrange airliner5 at this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines with possible configurations including overwing engines and a ttail3 the 7x7 would make its farnborough airshow debut in 1982 as the 767200 by 1976 a twinjet layout similar to the one which had debuted on the airbus a300 became the baseline configuration8 the decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of newgeneration jet powerplants8 while airline requirements for new widebody aircraft remained ambiguous8 the 7x7 was generally focused on midsize highdensity markets3 as such it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities9 advancements in civil aerospace technology including highbypassratio turbofan engines new flight deck systems aerodynamic improvements and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7x7510 many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new midsize narrowbody airliner codenamed 7n7 which would become the 75710 work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s1112 in january 1978 boeing announced a major extension of its everett factory—which was then dedicated to manufacturing the 747—to accommodate its new widebody family13 in february 1978 the new jetliner received the 767 model designation14 and three variants were planned a 767100 with 190 seats a 767200 with 210 seats and a trijet 767mrlr version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes815 the 767mrlr was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes16 the 767 was officially launched on july 14 1978 when united airlines ordered 30 of the 767200 variant followed by 50 more 767200 orders from american airlines and delta air lines later that year16 the 767100 was ultimately not offered for sale as its capacity was too close to the 757s seating16 while the 777 trijet was eventually dropped in favor of standardizing around the twinjet configuration8 design effort in the late 1970s operating cost replaced capacity as the primary factor in airliner purchases6 as a result the 767s design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset5 boeing targeted a 20 to 30 percent cost saving over earlier aircraft mainly through new engine and wing technology6 as development progressed engineers used computeraided design for over a third of the 767s design drawings6 and performed 26000 hours of wind tunnel tests16 design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet leading boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost1012 both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features including avionics flight management systems instruments and handling characteristics17 combined development costs were estimated at 35 to 4 billion6 forward view of a continental airlines 767400er showing fuselage profile wing dihedral and cf6 engines early 767 customers were given the choice of pratt whitney jt9d or general electric cf6 turbofans marking the first time that boeing had offered more than one engine option at the launch of a new airliner18 both jet engine models had a maximum output of 48000 poundsforce 210 kn of thrust9 the engines were mounted approximately onethird the length of the wing from the fuselage similar to previous widebody trijets6 the larger wings were designed using an aftloaded shape which reduced aerodynamic drag and distributed lift more evenly across their surface span than any of the manufacturers previous aircraft619 the wings provided higheraltitude cruise performance added fuel capacity and expansion room for future stretched variants16 the initial 767200 was designed for sufficient range to fly across north america or across the northern atlantic20 and would be capable of operating routes up to 3850 nautical miles 7130 km21 the 767s fuselage width was set midway between that of the 707 and the 747 at 165 feet 503 m5 while it was narrower than previous widebody designs seven abreast seating with two aisles could be fitted and the reduced width produced less aerodynamic drag918 the fuselage was not wide enough to accommodate two standard ld3 widebody unit load devices sidebyside2223 so a smaller container the ld224 was created specifically for the 76725 using a conventional tail design also allowed the rear fuselage to be tapered over a shorter section18 providing for parallel aisles along the full length of the passenger cabin and eliminating irregular seat rows toward the rear of the aircraft618 the first 767200 built n767ba in flight near mount rainier in the 1980s the 767 was the first boeing widebody to be designed with a twocrew digital glass cockpit17 cathode ray tube crt color displays and new electronics replaced the role of the flight engineer by enabling the pilot and copilot to monitor aircraft systems directly17 despite the promise of reduced crew costs united airlines initially demanded a conventional threeperson cockpit citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft26 the carrier maintained this position until july 1981 when a us presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating widebody jets2627 a threecrew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models28 ansett australia ordered 767s with threecrew cockpits due to union demands it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured2829 the 767s twocrew cockpit was also applied to the 757 allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course19 and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types30 although nominally similar in control design flying the 767 feels different from the 757 the 757s controls are heavy similar to the 727 and 747 the control yoke can be rotated to 90 degrees in each direction the 767 has far lighter control feel in pitch and roll and the control yoke has approximately 23 the rotation travel31 production and testing to produce the 767 boeing formed a network of subcontractors which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from italys aeritalia and japans ctdc7 the wings and cabin floor were produced inhouse while aeritalia provided control surfaces boeing vertol made the leading edge for the wings and boeing wichita produced the forward fuselage6 the ctdc provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies namely fuji heavy industries wing fairings and gear doors kawasaki heavy industries center fuselage and mitsubishi heavy industries rear fuselage doors and tail7 components were integrated during final assembly at the everett factory6 for expedited production of wing spars the main structural member of aircraft wings the everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting fasteners6 this method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 7476 final assembly of the first aircraft began in july 19793 final assembly of a 767300f at boeings everett factory which was expanded for 767 production in 1978 the prototype aircraft registered n767ba and equipped with jt9d turbofans rolled out on august 4 198132 by this time the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers including air canada all nippon airways britannia airways transbrasil and trans world airlines twa6 on september 26 1981 the prototype took its maiden flight under the command of company test pilots tommy edmonds lew wallick and john brit33 the maiden flight was largely uneventful save for the inability to retract the landing gear because of a hydraulic fluid leak33 the prototype was used for subsequent flight tests34 the 10month 767 flight test program utilized the first six aircraft built334 the first four aircraft were equipped with jt9d engines while the fifth and sixth were fitted with cf6 engines935 the test fleet was largely used to evaluate avionics flight systems handling and performance35 while the sixth aircraft was used for routeproving flights36 during testing pilots described the 767 as generally easy to fly with its maneuverability unencumbered by the bulkiness associated with larger widebody jets36 following 1600 hours of flight tests the jt9dpowered 767200 received certification from the us federal aviation administration faa and the uk civil aviation authority caa in july 19823334 the first delivery occurred on august 19 1982 to united airlines33 the cf6powered 767200 received certification in september 1982 followed by the first delivery to delta air lines on october 25 19829 service entry and operations the 767 entered service with united airlines on september 8 198237 the aircrafts first commercial flight used a jt9dpowered 767200 on the chicagotodenver route37 the cf6powered 767200 commenced service three months later with delta air lines3 upon delivery early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes including us transcontinental services38 american airlines and twa began flying the 767200 in late 1982 while air canada china airlines and el al began operating the aircraft in 198339 the aircrafts introduction was relatively smooth with few operational glitches and greater dispatch reliability than prior jetliners40 in its first year the 767 logged a 961 percent dispatch rate which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft40 operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjets sound levels interior comfort and economic performance40 resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings the replacement of an evacuation slide latch and the repair of a tailplane pivot to match production specifications40 twa began operating the first 767200 etops flights in may 1985 seeking to capitalize on its new widebodys potential for growth boeing offered an extendedrange model the 767200er in its first year of service41 ethiopian airlines placed the first order for the type in december 19824142 featuring increased gross weight and greater fuel capacity the extendedrange model could carry heavier payloads at distances up to 6385 nautical miles 11825 km43 and was targeted at overseas customers9 the 767200er entered service with el al airline on march 27 198442 the type was mainly ordered by international airlines operating mediumtraffic longdistance flights9 in the mid1980s the 767 spearheaded the growth of twinjet flights across the northern atlantic under extendedrange twinengine operational performance standards etops regulations the faas safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines41 before the 767 overwater flight paths of twinjets could be no more than 90 minutes away from diversion airports44 in may 1985 the faa granted its first approval for 120minute etops flights to 767 operators on an individual airline basis starting with twa provided that the operator met flight safety criteria44 this allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours distance from land44 the larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines44 the faa lengthened the etops time to 180 minutes for cf6powered 767s in 1989 making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration38 and all available engines received approval by 199345 regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircrafts sales4146 stretched derivatives forecasting airline interest in largercapacity models boeing announced the stretched 767300 in 1983 and the extendedrange 767300er in 19844147 both models offered a 20 percent passenger capacity increase24 while the extendedrange version was capable of operating flights up to 5990 nautical miles 11090 km48 japan airlines placed the first order for the 767300 in september 198341 following its first flight on january 30 198647 the type entered service with japan airlines on october 20 198642 the 767300er completed its first flight on december 9 198642 but it was not until march 1987 that the first firm order from american airlines was placed47 the type entered service with american airlines on march 3 198842 the 767300 and 767300er gained popularity after entering service and came to account for approximately twothirds of all 767s sold41 after the debut of the first stretched 767s boeing sought to address airline requests for greater capacity by proposing larger models including a partial doubledeck version informally named the hunchback of mukilteo from a town near boeings everett factory with a 757 body section mounted over the aft main fuselage4950 in 1986 boeing proposed the 767x a revised model with extended wings and a wider cabin but received little interest50 by 1988 the 767x had evolved into an allnew twinjet which revived the 777 designation50 until the 777s 1995 debut the 767300 and 767300er remained boeings secondlargest widebodies behind the 74747 a jal 767300 lands in front of an ana 767300er at kansai airport the −300 and −300er variants account for almost twothirds of all 767s sold buoyed by a recovering global economy and etops approval 767 sales accelerated in the midtolate 1980s 1989 was the most prolific year with 132 firm orders4146 by the early 1990s the widebody twinjet had become its manufacturers annual bestselling aircraft despite a slight decrease due to economic recession41 during this period the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between north america and europe51 by the end of the decade 767s crossed the atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined52 the 767 also propelled the growth of pointtopoint flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes2053 taking advantage of the aircrafts lower operating costs and smaller capacity operators added nonstop flights to secondary population centers thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights20 the increased number of cities receiving nonstop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as pointtopoint travel gained prominence at the expense of the traditional hubandspoke model2053 in february 1990 the first 767 equipped with rollsroyce rb211 turbofans a 767300 was delivered to british airways54 six months later the carrier temporarily grounded its entire 767 fleet after discovering cracks in the engine pylons of several aircraft55 the cracks were related to the extra weight of the rb211 engines which are 2205 pounds 1000 kg heavier than other 767 engines55 during the grounding interim repairs were conducted to alleviate stress on engine pylon components and a parts redesign in 1991 prevented further cracks55 boeing also performed a structural reassessment resulting in production changes and modifications to the engine pylons of all 767s in service56 the boeing 767400er was publicly unveiled on august 26 199942 in january 1993 following an order from ups airlines57 boeing launched a freighter variant the 767300f which entered service with ups on october 16 199542 the 767300f featured a main deck cargo hold upgraded landing gear and strengthened wing structure58 in november 1993 the japanese government launched the first 767 military derivative when it placed orders for the e767 an airborne early warning and control awacs variant based on the 767200er59 the first two e767s featuring extensive modifications to accommodate surveillance radar and other monitoring equipment were delivered in 1998 to the japan selfdefense forces6061 in november 1995 after abandoning development of a smaller version of the 777 boeing announced that it was revisiting studies for a larger 7676263 the proposed 767400x a second stretch of the aircraft offered a 12 percent capacity increase versus the 76730024 and featured an upgraded flight deck enhanced interior and greater wingspan62 the variant was specifically aimed at delta air lines pending replacement of its aging lockheed l1011 tristars and faced competition from the a330200 a shortened derivative of the airbus a33062 in march 1997 delta air lines launched the 767400er when it ordered the type to replace its l1011 fleet4262 in october 1997 continental airlines also ordered the 767400er to replace its mcdonnell douglas dc10 fleet6465 the type completed its first flight on october 9 1999 and entered service with continental airlines on september 14 200042 dreamliner introduction austrian airlines 767300er with blended winglets which reduce liftinduced drag in the early 2000s cumulative 767 deliveries approached 900 but new sales declined during an airline industry downturn66 in 2001 boeing dropped plans for a longerrange model the 767400erx in favor of the proposed sonic cruiser a new jetliner which aimed to fly 15 percent faster while having comparable fuel costs as the 7676768 the following year boeing announced the kc767 tanker transport a second military derivative of the 767200er69 launched with an order in october 2002 from the italian air force the kc767 was intended for the dual role of refueling other aircraft and carrying cargo69 the japanese government became the second customer for the type in march 200369 in may 2003 the united states air force usaf announced its intent to lease kc767s to replace its aging kc135 tankers7071 the plan was suspended in march 2004 amid a conflict of interest scandal70 resulting in multiple us government investigations and the departure of several boeing officials including philip condit the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer michael sears72 the first kc767s were delivered in 2008 to the japan selfdefense forces73 in late 2002 after airlines expressed reservations about its emphasis on speed over cost reduction74 boeing halted development of the sonic cruiser74 the following year the manufacturer announced the 7e7 a midsize 767 successor made from composite materials which promised to be 20 percent more fuel efficient75 the new jetliner was the first stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the boeing yellowstone project74 customers embraced the 7e7 later renamed 787 dreamliner and within two years it had become the fastestselling airliner in the companys history75 in 2005 boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record dreamliner sales citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option76 subsequently the 767300er was offered to customers affected by 787 delays including all nippon airways and japan airlines77 some aging 767s exceeding 20 years in age were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays78 to extend the operational lives of older aircraft airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures including dcheck teardowns and inspections for corrosion a recurring issue on aging 767s79 the first 787s entered service with all nippon airways in october 2011 42 months behind schedule80 continuous production ups the largest 767300f operator placed additional orders in 2007 in 2007 the 767 received a production boost when ups and dhl aviation placed a combined 33 orders for the 767300f8182 renewed freighter interest led boeing to consider enhanced versions of the 767200 and 767300f with increased gross weights 767400er wing extensions and 777 avionics83 net orders for the 767 declined from 24 in 2008 to just three in 201084 during the same period operators upgraded aircraft already in service in 2008 the first 767300er retrofitted with blended winglets from aviation partners incorporated debuted with american airlines85 the manufacturersanctioned winglets at 11 feet 335 m in height improved fuel efficiency by an estimated 65 percent85 other carriers including all nippon airways and delta air lines also ordered winglet kits8687 on february 2 2011 the 1000th 767 rolled out destined for all nippon airways88 the aircraft was the 91st 767300er ordered by the japanese carrier and with its completion the 767 became the second widebody airliner to reach the thousandunit milestone after the 7478889 the 1000th aircraft also marked the last model produced on the original 767 assembly line90 beginning with the 1001st aircraft production moved to another area in the everett factory which occupied about half of the previous floor space90 the new assembly line made room for 787 production and aimed to boost manufacturing efficiency by over twenty percent90 at the inauguration of its new assembly line the 767s order backlog numbered approximately 50 only enough for production to last until 201390 despite the reduced backlog boeing officials expressed optimism that additional orders would be forthcoming90 on february 24 2011 the usaf announced its selection of the kc767 advanced tanker an upgraded variant of the kc76791 for its kcx fleet renewal program90 the selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between boeing and airbus parent eads and came eight years after the usafs original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease kc767s70 the tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 201390 in december 2011 fedex express announced a 767300f order for 27 aircraft to replace its dc10 freighters citing the usaf tanker order and boeings decision to continue production as contributing factors92 fedex express agreed to buy an additional 19 of the −300f variant in june 20129394 in june 2015 fedex said it was accelerating retirements of planes both to reflect demand and to modernize its fleet recording charges of 276 million95 on july 21 2015 fedex announced an order for 50 767300f with options on another 50 the largest order for the type96 fedex confirmed that it has firm orders for 106 of the freighters for delivery between 2018 and 202395 with its planned successor the boeing new midsize airplane planned for at least a 2025 introduction and the 787 being much larger boeing could restart a passenger 767300er production to bridge the gap97 a demand for 50 to 60 aircraft could have to be satisfied98 design overview the nose assembly of a boeing 767 also known as fuselage section 41 the 767 is a lowwing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit featuring a single fin and rudder the wings are swept at 315 degrees and optimized for a cruising speed of mach 08 533 mph or 858 kmh18 each wing features a supercritical crosssection and is equipped with sixpanel leading edge slats single and doubleslotted flaps inboard and outboard ailerons and six spoilers699 the airframe further incorporates carbonfiberreinforced polymer composite material wing surfaces kevlar fairings and access panels plus improved aluminum alloys which together reduce overall weight by 1900 pounds 860 kg versus preceding aircraft6 to distribute the aircrafts weight on the ground the 767 has a retractable tricycle landing gear with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear6 the original wing and gear design accommodated the stretched 767300 without major changes41 the 767400er features a larger more widely spaced main gear with 777 wheels tires and brakes100 to prevent damage if the tail section contacts the runway surface during takeoff 767300 and 767400er models are fitted with a retractable tailskid100101 the 767 has leftside exit doors near the front and rear of the aircraft24 in addition to shared avionics and computer technology the 767 uses the same auxiliary power unit electric power systems and hydraulic parts as the 75730 a raised cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows result in similar pilot viewing angles102 related design and functionality allows 767 pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate the 757 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft17103 flight systems the original twocrew 767 glass cockpit with crt displays the upgraded 767400er cockpit with 6 lcd displays the 787style 767300f glass cockpit with 3 lcd displays the original 767 flight deck uses six rockwell collins crt screens to display electronic flight instrument system efis and engine indication and crew alerting system eicas information allowing pilots to handle monitoring tasks previously performed by the flight engineer17104 the crts replace conventional electromechanical instruments found on earlier aircraft17 an enhanced flight management system improved over versions used on early 747s17 automates navigation and other functions while an automatic landing system facilitates cat iiib instrument landings in low visibility situations6105 the 767 became the first aircraft to receive cat iiib certification from the faa for landings with 980 feet 300 m minimum visibility in 1984106 on the 767400er the cockpit layout is simplified further with six rockwell collins liquid crystal display lcd screens and adapted for similarities with the 777 and the next generation 737107 to retain operational commonality the lcd screens can be programmed to display information in the same manner as earlier 767s58 in 2012 boeing and rockwell collins launched a further 787based cockpit upgrade for the 767 featuring three landscapeformat lcd screens that can display two windows each108 the 767 is equipped with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces landing gear and utility actuation systems109 each engine powers a separate hydraulic system and the third system uses electric pumps110 a ram air turbine provides power for basic controls in the event of an emergency111 an early form of flybywire is employed for spoiler operation utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables6 the flybywire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers6 interior an early 767300 economy class cabin in 2–3–2 layout showing the original interior design a newer 767300er cabin with the 777style signature interior the 767 features a twinaisle cabin with a typical configuration of six abreast in business class and seven across in economy24 the standard seven abreast 2–3–2 economy class layout places approximately 87 percent of all seats at a window or aisle112 as a result the aircraft can be largely occupied before center seats need to be filled6 and each passenger is no more than one seat from the aisle112 it is possible to configure the aircraft with extra seats for up to an eight abreast configuration24 but this is less common113 the 767 interior introduced larger overhead bins and more lavatories per passenger than previous aircraft114 the bins are wider to accommodate garment bags without folding and strengthened for heavier carryon items114 a single large galley is installed near the aft doors allowing for more efficient meal service and simpler ground resupply114 passenger and service doors are an overhead plug type which retract upwards24 and commonly used doors can be equipped with an electricassist system6 in 2000 a 777style interior known as the boeing signature interior debuted on the 767400er115 subsequently adopted for all newbuild 767s the signature interior features even larger overhead bins indirect lighting and sculpted curved panels116 the 767400er also received larger windows derived from the 777117 older 767s can be retrofitted with the signature interior115 some operators have adopted a simpler modification known as the enhanced interior featuring curved ceiling panels and indirect lighting with minimal modification of cabin architecture118 as well as aftermarket modifications such as the nulook 767 package by heath tecna119 variants a british airways 767300er with deployed flaps after takeoff the
