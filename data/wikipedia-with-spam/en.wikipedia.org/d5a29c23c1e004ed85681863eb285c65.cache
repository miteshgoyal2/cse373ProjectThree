his sons play in strip clubs despite the boys strict religion from a young age jackson was exposed to sex he received mixed messages on the subject from his parents his mother katherine was a devout jehovahs witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage in contrast to his wife father joseph a steel mill worker shunned the religion and would have the jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in the earliest days of their career910 he allowed nineyearold michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude in one incident a fascinated michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear the stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra removing two large oranges and the wig from her head to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all9 while playing at chicagos peppermint lounge the brothers made use of a peephole in their dressing room through which they had a clear view of the womens bathroom they would take turns watching the women and as marlon recalled learned everything there was to know about ladies9 during other residencies the siblings would perform joe texs skinny legs and all joseph jackson would instruct a young michael to make his way into the audience crawl under tables lift up ladies skirts and peek at their panties as part of the performance911 though embarrassed by the task jackson feigned enjoyment as he knew the audience loved the routine9 following such performances the jackson brothers would be tucked in bed by their oblivious mother and reminded of the virtues of being a good jehovahs witness katherine remained unaware of her sons strip club activities for many years9 journalist j randy taraborrelli reflected on jacksons early life and noted that at such a young age the singer may not have been psychologically equipped to fully understand any sexual stimulation he may have received from such voyeuristic events the writer further commented that jacksons views on sex must have been conflicted between those of his religiously strict mother and his more libertine and promiscuous father9 groupies and prostitutesedit as members of the increasingly successful jackson 5 michaels brothers jermaine and jackie found fame advantageous as they toured the country they had sex with many female fans their guide was their father joseph who would often organize and arrange sexual encounters for his sons as well as cheat on his wife katherine with their sons groupies the two brothers would bring girls back to a hotel room where younger siblings michael and marlon were instructed to play sleep1012 one girl who had sexual relations with jermaine recalled such an experience i jumped into bed with him and he climbed on top of me as he climaxed he shuddered so loudly i was afraid he would wake up michael and marlon who were sleeping three feet away in the next bed or at least i thought they were sleeping as i was slipping out of the room i heard michael say to jermaine nice job now can we please get some sleep12 while marlon would correspond with and eventually marry his wife carol at 18 michael never had sex with groupies finding his brothers behavior toward women disgusting in addition to not touching groupies jackson reportedly never had an interest in having any type of sex as a youngster in one alleged incident when he was 15 years old a male family member arranged for two prostitutes to take his virginity they were told to work him over before being locked in a room with him12 instead michael picked up a bible and read bible verses to the girls the girls left in tears1213 james mcfield who worked with the jackson 5 stated that the lead singer of the band often needed someone to talk with it was at these times that women would be introduced to him for companionship mcfield asserted that he never witnessed anything sexual and that such females were not jacksons type he liked nice girls pure girls who appeared to have no street background12 jackson occasionally admonished and advised the groupies and prostitutes sent to pleasure his siblings one jackson fan recalled being selected from the audience to meet with jackie backstage she was handed a scrap of paper with an address to the location in which they were to meet michael approached her from behind and warned her that his brothers did not treat women right and that his brother only wanted to use her for sex changing the subject the female fan asked for the pop stars autograph which request he obliged in addition to writing please dont go the woman ignored michaels request and headed to the jacksons apartment complex where she had sex with jackie afterward jackie informed the woman that they would not meet again ashamed and upset the fan left the apartment in tears12 on another occasion a prostitute was brought to jacksons room after a concert in madison square garden there the pop star interrogated the sex worker asking why she was a prostitute whether she wanted to have sex with him and how much it would cost the woman responded that she was a prostitute for the money but that she would have sex with him for free because she wanted him the prostitute then proceeded to unbutton her blouse exposing her breasts apparently repulsed jackson turned his head and begged her to put them back12 the singer suggested that they talk instead but would still pay her which the prostitute declined to do she was not there to talk instead she gave jackson her telephone number urging him to call her when he wanted to get off jackson acknowledged the prostitute as she left stating that he would perhaps call her one day though he never did12 first relationshipsedit tatum onealedit one of jacksons first documented relationships was with the child actress tatum oneal in the 1970s their friendship was established by the time oneal was 12 and jackson was 17 and featured in gossip columns for several years after1415 jackson reflected in 1982 that he and oneal had been engaged in a serious relationship but because both were busy it had cooled off to the point of their remaining just friends15 in the documentary living with michael jackson 2003 michael alleged that near the beginning of their relationship the 12yearold actress tried to seduce the then 17yearold singer according to jackson the incident happened at her home where she attempted to unbutton his shirt and talked explicitly about sex oneals behavior apparently proved too much for jackson who became scared and covered his face before she walked away when confronted with the allegation oneal claimed to have been just as shocked as everyone else she stated that while having respect for jackson as an artist and a person he had a very vivid imagination the actress described his statements as inaccurate at 12 years old there was no way she was capable of being as mature or as sophisticated as he claimed1617 oneal released her autobiography a paper life in 2004 a year after the jackson documentary in the book she claimed it was jackson who attempted to make out with her the actress wrote i was just 12 and not at all ready for a reallife encounter michael who was sweating profusely seemed as intimidated as i was he jumped up nervously and said uh gotta go18 but this contradicted oneals own account of the relationship in 1995 in vibe where she remembered jackson as being so shy and one of the nicest most innocent people ive ever met and once he came into my bedroom and he wouldnt even sit on my bed14 she described the relationship as a really wonderful friendship where they would dance and talk on the phone all the time14 she recalled that he found it funny that she could drive at 12 and he couldnt and that one time they had a jam session at her house where he played the drums and her brother played guitar she said the relationship ended when she was 12 after he asked her to go to the premiere of the wiz with him but her agent disapproved maybe because they thought he wasnt a big enough star yet and she did what she was told because she was a child14 while she claimed they never spoke after that14 they were actually shown to be together a number of times after this would have happened19 jackson also spoke about oneal in 2001 with rabbi shmuley he described holding hands with her i was like in heaven it was the most magical thing it was better than kissing her it was better than anything6 he recalled one of the times they held hands i remember we went to this club and i dont go to clubs which was called the roxy and i was watching the band i was sitting there and underneath the table she was holding my hand and i was like melting rabbi shmuley she held your hand and you felt love fireworks going off6 it was all i needed but that means nothing to kids today she grew up too fast she wasnt into innocence and i love that20 and similar to what he told bashir he said she was 13 and i was naive she wanted to do everything and i didnt want to have sex at all2021 brooke shieldsedit jackson met 15yearold actressmodel brooke shields in 1981 at the academy awards622 from there the pair enjoyed a close relationship speaking in 2009 she reflected that they were close because sex was never an issue for them23 although the headlines in the media referred to shields talking about an asexual jackson after his death what she actually said was “as he grew older and the more he started to change physically the more asexual he became to me”3 she also said that as she grew up and started having boyfriends she would confide in him about her intimate experiences as he was curious she said he was like a little kid who talked about the bases – what first base was what second base was – and his curiosity was understandable given his guarded life3 in 2001 jackson told rabbi shmuley shields was one of the loves of my life i just wished she loved me as much as i loved her and they dated a lot6 before meeting her he said that he had pictures of her all over his room he recalled his happiness when they first met in 1981 he was at the 53rd academy awards with diana ross and shields walked up and introduced herself then at the afterparty she asked him to dance with her they exchanged numbers and he was up all night singing spinning around my room just so happy6 he also said “we had one encounter when she got real intimate and i chickened out and i shouldn’t have”24 in moonwalk 1988 jackson said his relationship with shields was romantically serious for a while2 shields said that while never formally proposing he would speak about the two marrying and raising adoptive children together the suggestions were met with disapproval from shields who felt such a move would have divided her life too much2526 she recalled there were times when he would ask me to marry him and i would say you have me for the rest of your life you don’t need to marry me i’m going to go onhave my own marriage and my own kids and you’ll always have me i think it made him relax he didn’t want to lose things that meant something to him3 as the couples separate lives diverged the two gradually saw each other less26 at the time of jacksons death in 2009 the pair had not seen each other for 16 years shields claimed that in the singers last years it was harder to get the right number to get through to him26 in july 2009 she spoke at the michael jackson memorial service reminiscing about their time together2728 thinking back to when we met and the many times that we spent together and whenever we were out together there would be a caption of some kind and the caption usually said something like an odd couple or an unlikely pair but to us it was the most natural and easiest of friendships michael always knew he could count on me to support him or be his date and that we would have fun no matter where we were we had a bond both of us needed to be adults very early but when we were together we were two little kids having fun2728 in a june 30 2009 interview ola ray also said that she and jackson would play like little kids when working on the thriller video 1983 as she recalled how he was clearly into brooke shields and kept on teasing her about shields visiting the set29 lisa marie presleyedit first meeting and courtshipedit lisa marie presley was introduced to jackson by her father elvis in 1974 a 16yearold michael jackson—who would later be dubbed the king of pop—was introduced for the first time to lisa marie presley at the mgm grand hotel and casino in paradise nevada by her father the king of rock n roll elvis presley lisa marie was six at the time and had been brought to the hotel to watch a show by the jackson 5 of whom she was a big fan the young girl was particularly fascinated by lead singer michael jackson and his talent at dancing30 according to a friend of presleys their adult friendship began in november 1992 in la4 they met at a private dinner held at the home of their mutual friend the artist brettlivingstone strong knowing that presley had been looking for help within the music industry strong had her play tapes for jackson who was impressed with presleys voice the pair talked for the remainder of the night until it was time for jackson to leave at this point according to strong the entertainer gave presley who was still married at the time a penetrating look and said in a conspiratorial voice you and me we could get into a lot of trouble think about that girl30 in the days following this interaction presley and jackson spoke on the telephone almost every day forging a strong friendship the two came to realize they had much in common both had been protected and sheltered from the real world both felt they had missed out on a normal childhood both were mistrustful of outsiders having spent most of their lives feeling exploited by them and both had problems with the media presley was raised in graceland while jackson lived at neverland in 1993 he became the subject of child sexual abuse accusations and presley along with a few others was there for emotional support michael would call presley from overseas as he embarked upon the second leg of the dangerous world tour and the child abuse investigation intensified during such telephone conversations presley attempted to reverse jacksons sadness with humor and advice presley later recalled that she believed in the musicians innocence and that she could save him30 fueled by her past addictions and her fathers death presley supported jackson as he became addicted on painkillers urging him to settle the allegations out of court and go into rehabilitation he subsequently did both30 proposal and weddingedit it was during one of jacksons calls to presley that he proposed marriage if i asked you to marry me would you do it the singer queried30 though still married to actor danny keough whom she had wed in 1988 and had two children with presley replied that she would after a pause jackson exclaimed that he had to use the bathroom having apparently relieved himself the singer explained to his new fiancee that his love for her was genuine and she had to believe him30 in 2010 presley acknowledged to oprah winfrey that jackson did formally propose one day in the library taking out a 10 carat diamond ring and getting down on his knees31 following several months engaged jackson and presley wed on may 26 1994 at a ceremony in the dominican republic3233 presley had divorced keough only 20 days before the 15minute ceremony was held by judge hugo francisco alvarez perez at his home in the la vega province the union was conducted in spanish and translated for presley and jackson by an attorney eva darling presleys friend served as a witness along with thomas keough her exhusbands brother3233 at the time of their marriage the press and public were unaware that the two even knew each other the wedding was kept secret from them jacksons family and presleys mother priscilla however gotham chopra recalled that jackson called him in a panic on his wedding night and asked if he had any sex advice wanting to make sure that lisa was impressed with his moves34 upon being informed of her daughters marriage with jackson a week later priscilla became irritated she believed the male pop singer was using her child to rehabilitate his image following the child abuse accusations32 to the press however priscilla stated that she was very supportive of lisa marie and everything she does35 the union was met with a mixed reaction from the media when it was made public two months later some sources described the union of the king of pop and the princess of rock n roll as being the marriage of the century36 one newspaper headline scoffed jacksonpresley union sparks shock doubt laughs35 addressing both the media and public the new mrs presleyjackson issued a statement my married name is mrs lisa marie presleyjackson my marriage to michael jackson took place in a private ceremony outside the united states 11 weeks ago it was not formally announced until now for several reasons foremost being that we are both very private people living in the glare of the public media we both wanted a private marriage ceremony without the distraction of a media circus i am very much in love with michael i dedicate my life to being his wife i understand and support him we both look forward to raising a family and living happy healthy lives together we hope friends and fans will understand and respect our privacy37 married life and disagreementsedit for the next year of their married life the newly wedded couple divided their time between jacksons 2700acre 11 km2 neverland ranch in santa ynez california and presleys 1acre 4000 m2 estate 100 miles 160 km away in hidden hills defying the initial thoughts of some of the public presley did not move into jacksons home upon getting married according to j randy taraborrelli this was due to her wanting to remain independent as well as presleys children danielle and benjamin finding their new stepfather a little strange38 the pairs first appeared together on television at the 1994 mtv video music awards in what has been described as a memorable moment holding hands the couple walked onto the stage in new york in front of a television audience of 250 million jackson announced just think nobody thought this would last before embracing presley in a kiss39 afterward presley became angered at her husband feeling he had used her the male pop singer reasoned that the liplock which was dubbed the kiss of the century would be talked about for decades with people playing the clip over and over3639 jacksons attempts at placating his wife proved futile she told the singer not to fucking even come near me and remained angry for several days39 in the same week jackson and presley had another argument newspaper reports had been suggesting that if elvis were alive he would not approve of his daughters marriage annoyed jackson reportedly suggested that the couple could find out by holding a séance to contact the deceased king of rock n roll39 during the session they would ask his opinion of the union presley felt the idea was tasteless and upon jacksons continuing to push the idea warned if you stay on this particular road theyre gonna need a medium to contact you in the great beyond because im about to put you there right now39 the two supposedly never spoke of the incident again39 primetime and further marriage difficultiesedit jackson and presley appeared on the television show primetime in june 199539 in jacksons first interview since 1993 and presleys first ever diane sawyer quizzed the pair on their private life with according to jet a series of insensitive questions3940 presley boasted that she and jackson had regular sex following sawyers questioning their sex life4142 when asked if the marriage was a sham presley asserted that such rumors were crap she said she would never marry someone for any other reason than being in love with him39 and concluded that if the public thought differently they could eat it39 the following day presley reflected that the interview had been a disaster she had hoped the couple would be perceived as being serious yet jackson fooled around during the show at one point holding two fingers behind his wifes head to make bunny ears presleys friend monica pastelle revealed that it was at this point that presley began to wonder whether she had made a mistake in choosing jackson as a longterm partner39 a further problem for the pair was jacksons insistence on being around children though she never believed he was a pedophile—i wouldnt have let him near my kids if i thought that—she felt her husband was only opening himself up to more rumor and innuendo following the 1993 allegations43 one evening at neverland presley confronted the pop star on the issue and was met with a defiant jackson resulting in another argument upon being called selfish the male musician pointed to his humanitarian endeavors presley countered that his philanthropy was irrelevant that the issue was about them4344 presley also disagreed with having children with the singer imagining the future and what would happen if the marriage ended presley saw a custody battle nightmare45 in addition she felt her husband was too emotionally immature to be a parent having watched his daily interactions with other people she believed he was the one in need of parenting jackson explained to his wife over breakfast one morning that she did not have to be the biological mother if she so desired he explained my friend debbie rowe said she will get pregnant and have my baby if you wont do it then she will how about that45 unmoved presley replied that it was fine by her45 following several more troubled months jackson ended up in the hospital he had collapsed while rehearsing for a concert in new york presley arrived to meet her ill husband and yet another heated debate ensued the argument ended after jackson warned her that she was making his heart rate go up and asked her to leave she obliged and was admonished by a doctor and jacksons mother katherine along the way46 presley subsequently returned to los angeles upon being discharged from hospital jackson went to disneyland paris to recover46 divorceedit presley filed for divorce in early 1996 citing irreconcilable differences and noting their date of separation as december 10 1995 shortly after the incident in the hospital4647 the divorce was finalized on august 20 1996 as part of the settlement presley received 10 of the royalties from history past present and future book i which album contained the song you are not alone whose music video featured a seminude presley and jackson frolicking against an ethereal backdrop4849 as she did not sign a confidentiality agreement a further clause stated that presley could write a tellall book about her time with jackson at the time the princess of rock n roll revealed that she had no wish to write a memoir the singer still had respect for jackson and did not want to speak critically of him presley also wanted to preserve her own dignity and keep their life together private48 its easy to be skeptical of michaels relationship with her but doing so risks ignoring his obvious humanity despite the plastic surgeries and maddening friendships with boys and all the rest of the eccentric behavior that goes into making michael jackson such a strange individual he is still a human being with emotions feelings and a beating heart and somehow lisa marie presley was the one to truly touch it to truly affect him j randy taraborrelli the magic and the madness 200448 the divorce proved difficult for jackson who spent several weeks lamenting his loss presley was the first person with whom he had connected on such a high level she had supported him as he faced allegations and became dependent on pain medication it was also the first time that the pop singer had had a sexual chemistry with another48 presley was able to make him open up and express himself through their physically intimate moments together at the time jackson was afraid there would never be another who made him feel the way his exwife had he eventually realized he had to move on he had a world tour coming up and music to work on jackson also knew that presley would never make him a father which he longed to be48 aftermathedit presley was seen with jackson in various cities during history world tour in 1997 notably at various functions in south africa5051 and in london holding hands backstage52 and around the city53 in february 1998 they were photographed in an intimate moment together outside a beverly hills restaurant on presleys birthday54 in a 2010 oprah interview presley admitted that they spent four years after the divorce getting back together and breaking up until she felt she had to push it away31 she described the parallels between the lives of jackson and her father elvis and said jackson constantly asked her about the details of elvis death because he felt that he was going to end up the same way31 she had described such a conversation in a blog post the day after jackson died wherein she shared her feelings about his death according to presley the last coherently good conversation she had with jackson was in 200531 she said jackson told her she had been right about certain people around him whom she called vampires31 she replied that she was indifferent when he asked if she still loved him31 but presley also said his death made her realize he loved her she acknowledged his efforts in the relationship saying he honestly tried so hard and went through so much with me but i didn’t appreciate it then and i wish i did31 at the end of the conversation he reportedly told her he felt that someone was going to try to kill him to get a hold of his catalog and his estate and named some names she didnt want to say in the interview31 debbie roweedit background and friendshipedit debbie rowe met michael jackson in the mid1980s while working as an assistant for the pop stars dermatologist dr arnold klein rowe treated jacksons vitiligo which he had been diagnosed with in 1986 and which would affect his physical appearance for the remainder of his life5556 rowe supported jackson providing answers to the questions jackson asked about his medical condition the pair became good friends the pop star frequently sent autographed merchandise to the woman who hung it on the walls of her office according to rowes friend tanya boyd the dermatologists assistant would obsess over jackson gushing over him and his traits she would say to her friend if people knew him like i knew him they would not think he was strange hes unique kinky actually56 the jacksonrowe friendship would last for several years during which time rowe married and divorced richard edelman a man she claimed to have felt trapped by rowe and the musician would both talk to each other about their unhappy marriages his with presley and hers with edelman a teacher at hollywood high school like jacksons first wife rowe supported the entertainer when he was accused of child sexual abuse jackson kept his friendship with rowe a secret from his wife who eventually found out but thought nothing of it she felt the dermatologists assistant was not her husbands type because she was not glamorous enough56 first pregnancy and miscarriageedit as presley had refused to carry jacksons children rowe offered to give birth to a child for the pop singer shortly after presley and jacksons separation rowe became pregnant but suffered a miscarriage in march 1996 the event devastated rowe who feared she would never be able to have a baby jackson comforted and consoled rowe throughout the ordeal which remained hidden from the media and public4648 second pregnancy and reactionedit jackson embarked on the first leg of his history world tour on september 1996 one month into the tour and several months after his divorce from presley jacksons personal life made headlines as it was revealed that debbie rowe was pregnant with his child one tabloid newspaper the news of the world told the story under the headline im having michaels baby rowe reacted furiously to the publication labeling the editorial staff bastards and complaining that they reported the story as if she and jackson were freaks j randy taraborrelli later noted that the article which had been put together from a secret tape recording between rowe and a friend had been fairly accurate it detailed that jackson was the father of the baby and that he would be raising the child alone it also stated that jackson impregnated rowe artificially with his own sperm cells a foolproof method of insemination further reports alleged that the relationship was an economic one she was in it for the money and he sought a baby4857 in a statement jackson condemned the accusations of being in an economic relationship and using artificial insemination as completely false and irresponsible despite the denials it was noted that rowe had received millions of dollars from jackson as gifts over the years among court papers filed against jackson in 2002 by business manager myung ho lee a monthly budget for jackson was detailed and included a 15 million payment to rowe the pop musician later bought the woman a 13 million home in 1997 he and rowe never lived together57 when the news of rowes pregnancy broke to jacksons mother katherine the jackson family matriarch urged her son to wed the mother of his unborn child katherine did not want her son to be like his father who had produced an illegitimate child with a woman while married to michaels mother katherine first spoke on the telephone to rowe about the sanctity of marriage and about the jehovahs witness faith she later spoke to jackson telling him to marry that nice girl debbie and give your child a name not like your poor halfsister johvonnie the words resonated with the musician who did not want to repeat his fathers sins58 prior to katherines words the view had been for rowe to act as a surrogate mother she would give the baby to jackson as a friendly favor and he would raise it jackson intended to issue a statement following the birth that the identity of the mother was a secret in the same way that the identities of many surrogates are protected katherines involvement however influenced jackson to call rowe and ask her to meet him in australia where he was staying as soon as she could there the entertainer announced his plans for them to wed the next day58 weddingedit jackson and rowe wed on november 13 1996 at the sheraton on the park hotel in sydney australia the night before the wedding jackson had called presley who gave him and rowe her blessing in front of 15 friends the pair exchanged vows at the hotel an 8yearold boy named anthony who was jacksons nephew served as the best man during the ceremony for the occasion jackson had put special effort into his appearance5859 media and public reaction to the marriage was negative and cynical some commentators believed jackson was marrying a person he did not love and rowe was having a baby who may not have been biologically jacksons the daily mirror a british tabloid newspaper published a photograph of rowe on the balcony of an australian hotel in it she is seen holding her head in her hands one jackson biographer stated that the womans dismayed and exasperated pose was most probably due to the excessive presence of paparazzi below the daily mirror however ran the photograph while mockingly proclaiming oh god ive just married michael jackson59 birth of prince michael jackson jredit jackson and rowes first child together michael joseph jackson jr also known as prince michael was born on february 13 1997 at cedarssinai medical center in los

arriving rowe was ushered into the hotel room where she was given the infant to hold and told to smile for the camera with michael afterward she was sent on her way rowe did not want to become too attached to prince as she felt it would make her situation harder to deal with59 at neverland prince was cared for by a team of six nannies and six nurses during his first few months according to one nanny who worked at the californian ranch prince michaels mother was not a significant presence in the childs early life i saw her maybe three times and she seemed very sullen63 second pregnancy and

following the birth jacksons associates contacted pope john paul ii at the vatican in rome in the hope that the pontiff would personally baptize the pop stars daughter an official for the pope informed jackson by letter that the leader of the catholic church would not participate in what may be perceived as a publicity stunt64 divorceedit feeling uncomfortable with their arrangement rowe asked jackson for a divorce which he granted on october 8 1999 rowe received around 10 million in a settlement which started with an immediate payment of 15 million64 with the divorce rowe gave

she did not know him the pop star added that in asking for a surrogate mother he did not care how old she was or what race she was it did however matter to him that she was intelligent healthy and had uncorrected eyesight64 in the television documentary the michael jackson interview the footage you were never meant to see a rebuttal video to martin bashirs living with michael jackson 2003 interview rowe attempted to explain her relationship with jackson and their two children69 my kids dont call me mom because i dont want them to theyre michaels children its not that they are not my children but i had them because i wanted him to be a father people make remarks i cant believe she left her children left them i left my children i did not leave my children my children are with their father where they are supposed to be i didnt do it to be a mother if he called me tonight and said lets have five more children id do it in a heartbeat69 in 2006 rowe legally applied for her access to her two children to be reinstated and subsequently reached an agreement with jackson following the singers death in 2009 his mother katherine was made the permanent guardian of prince michael paris and their halfbrother prince michael ii in addition a new custody arrangement was made with rowe who has visitation rights with her two children and will continue to receive spousal support payments67 questions have frequently arisen as to whether jackson was the biological father of his three children doubts first surfaced after it was reported that his son prince had white skin70 jackson insisted in 2003 that the children were biologically his71 allegations regarding sexualityedit further information 1993 child sexual abuse accusations against michael jackson and people v jackson despite his relationships with women jacksons sexuality was the subject of speculation and controversy for decades the pop singer faced allegations of being gay since he was a teenager as well as later being labelled asexual7273 one 1970s newspaper story alleged that the then 19yearold singer was to have a sex change operation and marry the songwriter clifton davis jackson found out about the story from a crying fan the musician reassured the girl that the tale was untrue and condemned it as a stupid rumor7274 the story circulated for many months during which time jackson became upset he was raised in a family where homosexuality was considered sinful jackson would continue to deny being gay throughout his life in a 1979 interview the pop star stated that he was not gay and that he would not have a nervous breakdown because people think i like having sex with men72 he added that if he let the rumor affect him it would make him cheap and make it sound as if he was prejudiced against gay people he expressed that many of his fans may be gay and that he did not mind that thats their life and this is mine72 1993 child sexual abuse allegationsedit in 1993 jackson was accused of child sexual abuse by evan chandler on behalf of his then13yearold child jordan chandler to the fathers disapproval and concern his son had become friends with the musician in may 1992 allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by evan chandler a dentist his son said that jackson had touched his penis75 evan chandler was taperecorded threatening to damage the singers music career and engaged jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement7677 jordan chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and jackson had engaged in acts of kissing masturbation and oral sex7778 jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the chandler family and their legal team for 22000000 in january 1994 after jordan chandler refused to testify in the criminal proceedings the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence and jackson was not charged with a crime jordan chandler later admitted to lying after jacksons death evan chandler committed suicide79 2003 child sexual abuse allegationsedit further accusations of child sexual abuse were made in 2003 by 13yearold gavin arvizo80 the allegations came after jackson and the boy appeared in the documentary living with michael jackson in which the entertainer stated that he shared his bed with children in a nonsexual fashion8182 the musician was subsequently indicted on four counts of molesting a minor four counts of intoxicating a minor one count of abduction and one count of conspiring to hold the boy and his family captive at neverland ranch83 during the fivemonth trial jackson faced allegations of child molestation and assertions that he had attempted to abduct the arvizo family in a hot air balloon84 he denied all the charges and family members proclaimed that he was the victim of an extortion attempt85 one friend firpo carr expressed amazement at the allegations leveled against the singer who at the time was living at neverland ranch im surprised they havent accused him of bestiality because he also has a zoo there i mean it gets ridiculous after a while86 on june 13 2005 the jury found jackson not guilty on all charges87 2013 and 2014 child sexual abuse allegationsedit in may 2013 choreographer wade robson filed a civil lawsuit against jacksons estate for child sexual abuse the date for the hearing which would determine whether or not robson could sue jacksons estate was scheduled for june 2 201488 robson met jackson when he was 5 years old in 2005 he had testified in jacksons defense during his child molestation trial at that trial jacksons former housekeeper blanca francia had testified that she had witnessed robson showering with jackson when robson was 8 or 9 years old89 however in his 2013 filing robson claimed that by the time he was 7 years old he was regularly having sleepovers at jacksons neverland ranch and jacksons homes in los angeles and las vegas which lasted until he was 14 and that jackson sexually abused him throughout the 7year period blanca francia agreed to testify on robsons behalf in the case90 the attorney for jacksons estate described robsons claim as outrageous and pathetic91 in may 2014 a second man jimmy safechuck filed a lawsuit against the jackson estate alleging that jackson had sexually abused him between the ages of 10 to about 1592 jackson had met safechuck in 1987 and safechuck then 10 was featured in the commercial of jacksons pepsi ad advertising his upcoming bad world tour at the time in july 2017 safechucks case against the singers production companies charging them with neglect was dismissed93 referencesedit jackson p165 a b jackson p166 a b c d brooke shields reveals michael jackson relationship secrets etonline cbs studios 20090707  a b gliatto tom 19940815
