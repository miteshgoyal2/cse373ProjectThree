fan base on music television mtv34 his music videos including those for beat it billie jean and thriller from his 1982 album thriller are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool5 the popularity of these videos helped bring the television channel mtv to fame on june 28 2009 in a baltimore sun article titled 7 ways michael jackson

beaumontthomas music editor of the guardian stated that jackson ushered in a global culture writing well get to the music and dance but perhaps his most astonishing achievement is his fame he was the subject of global adulation even in areas previously untouched by western pop culture11 tony sclafani from msnbc stated that there was a time when jackson was thought of primarily as a groundbreaking artist not a celebrity oddball that time was 1983 when jackson’s omnipresence on the pop charts was revolutionary because no africanamerican artist had ever achieved that high a level of success jackson earned his pop icon status by creating music that transcended genres he also redefined the roles of music videos and dancing in popular music12 in united statesedit in a 2015 rolling stone article titled michael jackson black superhero touré wrote many blacks now compare michael with barack obama – perhaps the highest possible compliment in black america not only are they both integrationists and racial harmonists but they both were determined to reach the top while refusing to let race hold them back there are so many components of why barack obama is president says diddy and michael jackson is one of them he started a change in the perception of the africanamerican male on a worldwide level his strength always putting himself in a powerposition being seen as a hero al sharpton echoes the point way before tiger woods or barack obama michael made black people go popculture global he says you had people in france south america and iowa comfortable with their kids imitating a black kid from gary indiana and when some of those people in iowa grew they were comfortable with voting for barack obama because they got comfortable imitating a black kid named michael jackson when they were young obama is a phenomenon but hes the result of a process that michael helped america graduate to13 in braziledit in 1996 jackson visited dona marta rio de janeiro brazil to film one of the video for they dont care about uswhen jackson came to brazil to shoot the video directed by spike lee rios local government became concerned that the singer would show the world an unflattering picture of poverty officials in the state of rio feared images of poverty might affect tourism and accused jackson of exploiting the poorothers supported jacksons wish to highlight the problems of the region arguing that the government were embarrassed by their own failings a judge banned all filming but this ruling was overturned by an injunction jackson also collaborated with 200 members of the cultural group olodum who swayed to the heavy beat of salvador1415 precarious houses in the favela of complexo do alemão in rio de janeiro identical scenes are viewable in the first music video of they dont care about us speaking of the music video in the new brazilian cinema lúcia nagib observed when michael jackson decided to shoot his new music video in a favela of rio de janeiro  he used the favela people as extras in a visual superspectacle  all the while there is a vaguely political appeal in there  the interesting aspect of michael jacksons strategy is the efficiency with which it gives visibility to poverty and social problems in countries like brazil without resorting to traditional political discourse the problematic aspect is that it does not entail a real intervention in that poverty16 in 2009 billboard described the area as now a model for social development and claimed that jacksons influence was partially responsible for this improvement17 fashionedit jacksons history jacket as a fashion pioneer jackson was the man who gave new meaning to moonwalking immortalised solitary sparkly gloves initiated the trophy jacket trend in the eighties
