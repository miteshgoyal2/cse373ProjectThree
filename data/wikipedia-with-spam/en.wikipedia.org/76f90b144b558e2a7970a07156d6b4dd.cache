versions follow the same basic plot but they are in many places mutually contradictory as adams rewrote the story substantially for each new adaptation7 throughout all versions the series follows the adventures of arthur dent a hapless englishman following the destruction of the earth by the vogons a race of unpleasant and bureaucratic aliens to make way for an intergalactic bypass dents adventures intersect with several other characters ford prefect who named himself after the ford prefect car to blend in with what was assumed to be the dominant life form automobiles an alien from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of betelgeuse and a researcher for the eponymous guidebook who rescues dent from earths destruction zaphod beeblebrox fords eccentric semicousin and the galactic president the depressed robot marvin the paranoid android and trillian formerly known as tricia mcmillan a woman arthur once met at a party in islington and the only other human survivor of earths destruction thanks to beeblebrox intervention backgroundedit the first radio series comes from a proposal called the ends of the earth six selfcontained episodes all ending with earths being destroyed in a different way while writing the first episode adams realized that he needed someone on the planet who was an alien to provide some context and that this alien needed a reason to be there adams finally settled on making the alien a roving researcher for a wholly remarkable book named the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy as the first radio episodes writing progressed the guide became the centre of his story and he decided to focus the series on it with the destruction of earth being the only holdover8 adams claimed that the title came from a 1971 incident while he was hitchhiking around europe as a young man with a copy of the hitchhikers guide to europe book while lying drunk in a field near innsbruck with a copy of the book and looking up at the stars he thought it would be a good idea for someone to write a hitchhikers guide to the galaxy as well however he later claimed that he had told this story so many times that he had forgotten the incident itself and only remembered himself telling the story his friends are quoted as saying that adams mentioned the idea of hitchhiking around the galaxy to them while on holiday in greece in 19739 adamss fictional guide is an electronic guidebook to the entire universe originally published by megadodo publications one of the great publishing houses of ursa minor beta the narrative of the various versions of the story are frequently punctuated with excerpts from the guide the voice of the guide peter jones in the first two radio series and tv versions later william franklyn in the third fourth and fifth radio series and stephen fry in the movie version also provides general narration original radio seriesedit see also the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy radio series and the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy primary and secondary phases the first radio series of six episodes called fits after the names of the sections of lewis carrolls nonsense poem the hunting of the snark10 was broadcast in 1978 on bbc radio 4 despite a lowkey launch of the series the first episode was broadcast at 1030 pm on wednesday 8 march 1978 it received generally good reviews and a tremendous audience reaction for radio11 a oneoff episode a christmas special was broadcast later in the year the bbc had a practice at the time of commissioning christmas special episodes for popular radio series and while an early draft of this episode of the hitchhikers guide had a christmasrelated plotline it was decided to be in slightly poor taste and the episode as transmitted served as a bridge between the two series12 this episode was released as part of the second radio series and later the secondary phase on cassettes and cds the primary and secondary phases were aired in a slightly edited version in the united states on npr playhouse the first series was repeated twice in 1978 alone and many more times in the next few years this led to an lp rerecording produced independently of the bbc for sale and a further adaptation of the series as a book a second radio series which consisted of a further six episodes and bringing the total number of episodes to 12 was broadcast in 1980 the radio series and the lp and tv versions greatly benefited from the narration of noted comedy actor peter jones as the book he was cast after it was decided that a peter jonesy sort of voice was required this led to a threemonth search for an actor who sounded exactly like peter jones which was unsuccessful the producers then hired peter jones as exactly the peter jonesy voice they were looking for13 the series was also notable for its use of sound being the first comedy series to be produced in stereocitation needed adams said that he wanted the programmes production to be comparable to that of a modern rock album much of the programmes budget was spent on sound effects which were largely the work of paddy kingsland for the pilot episode and the complete second series at the bbc radiophonic workshop and dick mills and harry parker for the remaining episodes 2–6 of the first series the fact that they were at the forefront of modern radio production in 1978 and 1980 was reflected when the three new series of hitchhikers became some of the first radio shows to be mixed into fourchannel dolby surround this mix was also featured on dvd releases of the third radio series the theme tune used for the radio television lp and film versions is journey of the sorcerer an instrumental piece composed by bernie leadon and recorded by the eagles on their album one of these nights only the transmitted radio series used the original recording a soundalike cover by tim souster was used for the lp and tv series another arrangement by joby talbot was used for the 2005 film and still another arrangement this time by philip pope was recorded to be released with the cds of the last three radio series apparently adams chose this song for its futuristicsounding nature but also for the fact that it had a banjo in it which as geoffrey perkins recalls adams said would give an on the road hitchhiking feel to it14 the twelve episodes were released in a slightly edited form removing the pink floyd music and two other tunes hummed by marvin when the team land on magrathea on cd and cassette in 1988 becoming the first cd release in the bbc radio collection they were rereleased in 1992 and at this time adams suggested that they could retitle fits the first to sixth as the primary phase and fits the seventh to twelfth as the secondary phase instead of just the first series and the second series15 it was about at this time that a tertiary phase was first discussed with dirk maggs adapting life the universe and everything but this series would not be recorded for another ten years16 main cast simon jones as arthur dent geoffrey mcgivern as ford prefect susan sheridan as trillian mark wingdavey as zaphod beeblebrox stephen moore as marvin the paranoid android richard vernon as slartibartfast peter jones as the book novelsedit the novels are described as a trilogy in five parts having been described as a trilogy on the release of the third book and then a trilogy in four parts on the release of the fourth book the us edition of the fifth book was originally released with the legend the fifth book in the increasingly inaccurately named hitchhikers trilogy on the cover subsequent rereleases of the other novels bore the legend the first second third fourth book in the increasingly inaccurately named hitchhikers trilogy in addition the blurb on the fifth book describes it as the book that gives a whole new meaning to the word trilogy the plots of the television and radio series are more or less the same as that of the first two novels though some of the events occur in a different order and many of the details are changed much of parts five and six of the radio series were written by john lloyd but his material did not make it into the other versions of the story and is not included here many consider the books version of events to be definitive because they are the most readily accessible and widely distributed version of the story however they are not the final version that adams produced before his death from a heart attack at age 49 in 2001 adams was considering writing a sixth novel in the hitchhikers series he was working on a third dirk gently novel under the working title the salmon of doubt but felt that the book was not working and abandoned it in an interview he said some of the ideas in the book might fit better in the hitchhikers series and suggested he might rework those ideas into a sixth book in that series he described mostly harmless as a very bleak book and said he would love to finish hitchhiker on a slightly more upbeat note adams also remarked that if he were to write a sixth instalment he would at least start with all the characters in the same place17 eoin colfer who wrote the sixth book in the hitchhikers series in 2008–09 used this latter concept but none of the plot ideas from the salmon of doubtcitation needed the hitchhikers guide to the galaxyedit main article the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy novel in the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy published in 1979 the characters visit the legendary planet magrathea home to the nowcollapsed planetbuilding industry and meet slartibartfast a planetary coastline designer who was responsible for the fjords of norway through archival recordings he relates the story of a race of hyperintelligent pandimensional beings who built a computer named deep thought to calculate the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe and everything when the answer was revealed to be 42 deep thought explained that the answer was incomprehensible because the beings didnt know what they were asking it went on to predict that another computer more powerful than itself would be made and designed by it to calculate the question for the answer later on referencing this adams would create the 42 puzzle a puzzle which could be approached in multiple ways all yielding the answer 42 the computer often mistaken for a planet because of its size and use of biological components was the earth and was destroyed by vogons to make way for a hyperspatial express route five minutes before the conclusion of its 10millionyear program two members of the race of hyperintelligent pandimensional beings who commissioned the earth in the first place disguise themselves as trillians mice and want to dissect arthurs brain to help reconstruct the question since he was part of the earths matrix moments before it was destroyed and so he is likely to have part of the question buried in his brain trillian is also human but had left earth six months previously with zaphod beeblebrox president of the galaxy the protagonists escape setting course for the restaurant at the end of the universe the mice in arthurs absence create a phony question since it is too troublesome for them to wait 10 million years again just to cash in on a lucrative deal the book was adapted from the first four radio episodes it was first published in 1979 initially in paperback by pan books after bbc publishing had turned down the offer of publishing a novelisation an action they would later regret18 the book reached number one on the book charts in only its second week and

full of the outcasts of the golgafrinchan civilisation the ship crashes on prehistoric earth ford and arthur are stranded and it becomes clear that the inept golgafrinchans are the ancestors of modern humans having displaced the earths indigenous hominids this has disrupted the earths programming so that when ford and arthur manage to extract the final readout from arthurs subconscious mind by pulling lettered tiles from a scrabble set it is what do you get if you multiply six by nine arthur then comments ive always said there was something fundamentally wrong with the universe the book was adapted from the remaining material in the radio series—covering from the fifth episode to the twelfth episode although the ordering was greatly changed in particular the events of fit the sixth with ford and arthur being stranded on prehistoric earth end the book and their rescue in fit the seventh is deleted and most of the brontitall incident was omitted instead of the haggunenon sequence

novels and there is a foreword by simon jones introductions by the producer and the director and other introductory notes from other members of the cast television seriesedit main article the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy tv series the popularity of the radio series gave rise to a sixepisode television series directed and produced by alan j w bell which first aired on bbc 2 in january and february 1981 it employed many of the actors from the radio series and was based mainly on the radio versions of fits the first to sixth a second series was at one point planned with a storyline according to alan bell and mark wingdavey that would have come from adamss abandoned doctor who and the krikkitmen project instead of simply making a tv version of the second radio series however adams got into disputes with the bbc accounts differ problems with budget scripts and having alan bell involved are all offered as causes and the second series was never made elements of doctor who and the krikkitmen were instead used in the third novel life the universe and everything the main cast was the same as the original radio series except for david dixon as ford prefect instead of mcgivern and sandra dickinson as trillian instead of sheridan other television appearancesedit segments of several of the books were adapted as part of the bbcs the big read survey and programme

broadcast in september and october 2004 and may and june 2005 cd releases accompanied the transmission of the final episode in each series the adaptation of the third novel followed the book very closely which caused major structural issues in meshing with the preceding radio series in comparison to the second novel because many events from the radio series were omitted from the second novel and those that did occur happened in a different order the two series split in completely different directions the last two adaptations vary somewhat—some events in mostly harmless are now foreshadowed in the adaptation of so long and thanks for all the fish while both include some additional material that builds on incidents in the third series to tie all five and their divergent plotlines together most especially including the character zaphod more prominently in the final chapters and addressing his altered reality to include the events of the secondary phase while mostly harmless originally contained a rather bleak ending dirk maggs created a different ending for the transmitted radio version ending it on a much more upbeat note reuniting the cast one last time the core cast for the third to fifth radio series remained the same except for the replacement of peter jones by william franklyn as the book and richard vernon by richard griffiths as slartibartfast

performed at the institute of contemporary arts in london between 1 and 19 may 1979 starring chris langham as arthur dent langham later returned to hitchhikers as prak in the final episode of 2004s tertiary phase and richard hope as ford prefect this show was adapted from the first series scripts and was directed by ken campbell who went on to perform a character in the final episode of the second radio series the show ran 90 minutes but had an audience limited to eighty people per night actors performed on a variety of ledges and platforms and the audience was pushed around in a hovercar 12000th of an inch above the floor this was the first time that zaphod was represented by having two actors in one large costume the narration of the book was split between two usherettes an

in july 1980 this was the second production directed by ken campbell the rainbow theatre had been adapted for stagings of rock operas in the 1970s and both reference books mentioned in footnotes indicate that this coupled with incidental music throughout the performance caused some reviewers to label it as a musical this was the first adaptation for which adams wrote the dish of the day sequence the production ran for over three hours and was widely panned for this as well as for the music laser effects and the acting despite attempts to shorten the script and make other changes it closed three or four weeks early accounts differ and lost a lot of money despite the bad reviews there were at least two standout performances michael cule and david learner both went on from this production to appearances in the tv adaptation in december 2011 a new stage production was announced to begin touring in june 2012 this included members of the original radio and tv casts such as simon jones geoff mcgivern susan sheridan mark wingdavey and stephen moore with vip guests playing the role of the book it was produced in the form of a radio show which could be downloaded when the tour was completed3334 this production was based on the first four fits in the first act with the second act covering material from the rest of the series the show also featured a band who performed the songs share and enjoy the krikkit song under the ink black sky marvins song how i hate the night and marvin which was a minor hit in 1981 live radio adaptationedit on saturday 29 march 2014 radio 4 broadcast an adaptation in front of a live audience featuring many members of the original cast including stephen moore susan sheridan mark wingdavey simon jones and geoff mcgivern with john lloyd as the book35 the adaptation was adapted by dirk maggs primarily from fit the first including material from the books and later radio fits as well as some new jokes it formed part of radio 4s character invasion series lp album adaptationsedit the first four radio episodes were adapted for a new double lp also entitled the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy appended with part one for the subsequent canadian release first by mailorder only and later into stores the double lp and its sequel were originally released by original records in the united kingdom in 1979 and 1980 with the catalogue numbers ora042 and ora054 respectively they were first released by hannibal records in 1982 as hnbl 2301 and hnbl 1307 respectively in the united states and canada and later rereleased in a slightly abridged edition by simon schusters audioworks in the mid1980s both were produced by geoffrey perkins and featured cover artwork by hipgnosis the script in the first double lp very closely follows the first four radio episodes although further cuts had to be made for reasons of timing despite this other lines of dialogue that were indicated as having been cut when the original scripts from the radio series were eventually published can be heard in the lp version the simon schuster cassettes omit the veet voojagig narration the cheerleaders speech as deep thought concludes its sevenandonehalfmillionyear programme and a few other lines from both sides of the second lp of the set hitchhikers theme journey of the sorcerer original records version excerpt problems playing this file see media help most of the original cast returned except for susan sheridan who was recording a voice for the character of princess eilonwy in the black cauldron for walt disney pictures cindy oswin voiced trillian on all three lps in her place other casting changes in the first double lp included stephen moore taking on the additional role of the barman and valentine dyall as the voice of deep thought adamss voice can be heard making the public address announcements on magrathea because of copyright issues the music used during the first radio series was either replaced or in the case of the title it was rerecorded in a new arrangement composer tim souster did both duties with paddy kingsland contributing music as well and sousters version of the theme was the version also used for the eventual television series36 the sequel lp was released singly as the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy part two the restaurant at the end of the universe in the uk and simply as the restaurant at the end of the universe in the usa the script here mostly follows fit the fifth and fit the sixth but includes a song by the backup band in the restaurant reg nullify and his cataclysmic combo and changes the haggunenon sequence to disaster area reg nullify and his cataclysmic combo excerpt problems playing this file see media help as the result of a misunderstanding the second record was released before being cut down in a final edit that douglas adams and geoffrey perkins had both intended to make perkins has said it is far too long on each side its just a rough cut i felt it was flabby and i wanted to speed it up37 the simon schuster audioworks rerelease of this lp was also abridged slightly from its original release the scene with ford prefect and hotblack desiatos bodyguard is omitted sales for the first doublelp release were primarily through mail order total sales reached over 60000 units with half of those being mail order and the other half through retail outlets38 this is in spite of the facts that original records warehouse ordered and stocked more copies than they were actually selling for quite some time and that paul neil milne johnstone complained about his name and thencurrent address being included in the recording39 this was corrected for a later pressing of the doublelp by cutting up that part of the master tape and reassembling it in the wrong order40 the second lp release part two also only sold a total of 60000 units in the uk38 the distribution deals for the united states and canada with hannibal records and simon and schuster were later negotiated by douglas adams and his agent ed victor after gaining full rights to the recordings from original records which went bankrupt41 audiobook adaptationsedit there have been three audiobook

legal action the game was withdrawn and all remaining copies were destroyed another account states that the programmer bob chappell rewrote the game to remove all hitchhikers references and republished it as cosmic capers42 officially the tv series was followed in 1984 by a bestselling interactive fiction or textbased adventure game distributed by infocom it was designed by adams and infocom regular steve meretzky43 and was one of infocoms most successful games44 as with many infocom games the box contained a number of feelies including a dont panic badge some pocket fluff a pair of perilsensitive sunglasses made of cardboard an order for the destruction of the earth a small clear plastic bag containing a microscopic battle fleet and an order for the destruction of arthur dents house signed by adams and meretzky45 in september 2004 it was revived by the bbc on the hitchhikers section of the radio 4 website for the initial broadcast of the tertiary phase and is still

game named the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy adventure game54 despite its name the newly designed puzzles by tko softwares ireland studio were different from the infocom ones and the game followed
