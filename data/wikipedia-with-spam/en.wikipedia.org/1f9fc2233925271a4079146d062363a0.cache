proletariat are the people employed for wages especially in manuallabour occupations and in skilled industrial work1 workingclass occupations include bluecollar jobs some whitecollar jobs and most pinkcollar jobs the working class only rely upon their earnings from wage labour thereby the category includes most of the working population of industrialized economies of the urban areas cities towns villages of nonindustrialized economies and of the rural workforce in marxist theory and socialist literature the term working class is often used interchangeably with the term proletariat and includes all workers who expend both physical and mental labour salaried knowledge workers and whitecollar workers to produce economic value for the owners of the means of production the bourgeoisie in marxist literature2 since workingclass wages can be very low and because the state of unemployment is defined as a lack of independent means of generating an income and a lack of wagelabour employment the term working class also includes the lumpenproletariat unemployed people who are extremely poorcitation needed contents 1 definitions 2 history and growth 3 marxist definition 4 see also 5 references 6 further reading 7 external links definitionsedit as with many terms describing social class working class is defined and used in many different ways the most general definition used by marxists and socialists is that the working class includes all those who have nothing to sell but their laborpower and skills in that sense it includes both white and bluecollar workers manual and mental workers of all types excluding only individuals who derive their income from business ownership and the labor of others when used nonacademically in the united states however it often refers to a section of society dependent on physical labor especially when compensated with an hourly wage for certain types of science as well as less scientific or journalistic political analysis for example the working class is loosely defined as those without college degrees3 workingclass occupations are then categorized into four groups unskilled laborers artisans outworkers and factory workers4 a common alternative sometimes used in sociology is to define class by income levels when this approach is used the working class can be contrasted with a socalled middle class on the basis of differential terms of access to economic resources education cultural interests and other goods and services the cutoff between working class and middle class here might mean the line where a population has discretionary income rather than simply sustenance for example on fashion versus merely nutrition and shelter some researchers have suggested that workingclass status should be defined subjectively as selfidentification with the workingclass group5 this subjective approach allows people rather than researchers to define their own social class history and growthedit this section does

message working class life in victorian wetherby west riding of yorkshire england the uk in feudal europe the working class as such did not exist in large numbers instead most people were part of the laboring class a group made up of different professions trades and occupations a lawyer craftsman and peasant were all considered to be part of the same social unit a third estate of people who were neither aristocrats nor church officials similar hierarchies existed outside europe in other preindustrial societies the social position of these laboring classes was viewed as ordained by natural law and common religious belief this social position was contested particularly by peasants for example during the german peasants war in the late 18th century under the influence of the enlightenment european society was in a state of change and this change could not be reconciled with the idea of a changeless godcreated social order wealthy members of these societies created ideologies which blamed many of the problems of workingclass people on their morals and ethics ie excessive consumption of alcohol perceived laziness and inability to save money in the making of the english working class ep thompson argues that the english working class was present at its own creation and seeks to describe the transformation of premodern laboring classes into a modern politically selfconscious working class starting around 1917 a number of countries became ruled ostensibly in the interests of the working class see soviet working class some historians have noted that a key change in these sovietstyle societies has been a massive a new type of proletarianisation often effected by the administratively achieved forced displacement of peasants and rural workers since then four major industrial states have turned towards semimarketbased governance china laos vietnam cuba and one state has turned inwards into an increasing cycle of poverty and brutalisation north korea other states of this sort have either collapsed such as the soviet union or never achieved significant levels of industrialization or large working classes since 1960 largescale proletarianisation and enclosure of commons has occurred in the third world generating new working classes additionally countries such as india have been slowly undergoing social change expanding the size of the urban working class

learn how and when to remove this template message main article proletariat striking teamsters battling police on the streets of minneapolis minnesota the us june 1934 karl marx defined the working class or proletariat as individuals who sell their labour power for wages and who do not own the means of production he argued that they were responsible for creating the wealth of a society he asserted that the working class physically build bridges craft furniture grow food and nurse children but do not own land or factories a subsection of the proletariat the lumpenproletariat ragproletariat are the extremely poor and unemployed such as day laborers and homeless people in the communist manifesto karl marx and friedrich engels argued that it was the destiny of the working class to displace the capitalist system with the dictatorship of the proletariat abolishing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future communist society in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all some issues in marxist arguments about workingclass membership have included the class status of people in a temporary or permanent position of unemployment the class status of domestic labor particularly the children see child labour and also traditionally the wives of male workers as some spouses do not themselves work in paying jobs outside the home whether workers can be considered working class if they own personal property or small amounts of stock ownership the relationships among peasants rural smallholders and the working class the extent to which nonclass group identities and politics race gender et al can obviate or substitute for workingclass membership in enlightenment projects where workingclass membership is prohibitively contradictory or obfuscated possible responses to some of these issues are unemployed workers are proletariat class for dependents is determined by the primary income earner personal property is argued to be different from private property for example the proletariat can own houses this is personal property the selfemployed worker may be a member of the petite bourgeoisie for example a highly paid professional athlete etc or a member of the proletariat for example a contract worker whose income may be relatively high but is precarious in general in marxist terms wage laborers and those dependent on the welfare state are working class and those who live on accumulated capital are not this broad dichotomy defines the class struggle different groups and individuals may at any given time be on one side or the other for example retired factory workers are workingclass in the popular sense but to the extent that they live off fixed incomes financed by stock in corporations whose earnings are profit retired factory workers interests and possibly their identities and politics are not working class such contradictions of interests and identity within individuals lives and within communities can effectively undermine the ability of the working class to act in solidarity to reduce exploitation inequality and the role of ownership in
