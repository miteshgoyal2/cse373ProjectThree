that historys album tracks like stranger in moscow were jacksons response to recent events in his personal life4 in 1993 the relationship between jackson and the press soured entirely when he was accused of child sexual abuse although never charged with a crime jackson was subject to intense media scrutiny while the criminal investigation took place complaints about the coverage and media included using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline5 accepting stories of jacksons alleged criminal activity in return for money6 accepting leaked material from the police investigation in return for money paid7 deliberately using pictures of jacksons appearance at its worst8 a lack of objectivity8 and using headlines that strongly implied jacksons guilt8 at the time jackson said of the media reaction i will say i am particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible terrible mass media at every opportunity the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions910 a few months after the allegations became news jackson had lost approximately 10 pounds 45 kg in weight and had stopped eating11 jacksons health had deteriorated to the extent that he canceled the remainder of his dangerous world tour and went into rehabilitation1213 jackson booked the whole fourth floor of the clinic and was put on a valium iv to wean him from painkillers121314 the singers spokesperson told reporters that jackson was barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level13 while in the clinic jackson took part in group and oneonone therapy sessions1213 when jackson left the us to go into rehabilitation the media showed the singer little sympathy the daily mirror held a spot the jacko contest offering readers a trip to walt disney world if they could correctly predict where the entertainer would appear next12 a daily express headline read drug treatment star faces life on the run while a news of the world headline accused jackson of being a fugitive these tabloids also falsely alleged that jackson had traveled to europe to have cosmetic surgery that would make him unrecognizable on his return12 geraldo rivera set up a mock trial with a jury made up of audience members even though jackson had not been charged with a crime15 stranger in moscow is an rb ballad1416 penned by jackson in 1993 during his dangerous world tour stop in moscow the instrumental portion of the song is based on the end credits theme of sonic the hedgehog 3 1994 a video game which jackson and his tour keyboardist brad buxer were brought in to compose music for1718 conflicting accounts state that jackson either dropped out of the project after scandals involving him arose around this time or because of his own personal dissatisfaction with the limitations of the sega genesiss sound chip1920 the lyrics for the song are based upon a poem written by jackson a background guitar was played by steve lukather while keyboards synthesizers and bass are credited to david paich and steve porcaro21 originally history was planned as a greatest hits release with a few new tracks however jackson and his collaborators were so pleased with the result of stranger in moscow that they decided to give history a full studio album as the second disc22 jackson used elements of russian imagery and symbolism to help promote the concept of fear and alienation in the track in a similar fashion to simply reds album love and the russian winter several years later23 it concludes with a narrative spoken in russian by a kgb interrogator ed wiesnieski24 the narrative translated into english is why have you come from the west confess to steal the great achievements of the people the accomplishments of the workers25 music and critical receptionedit stranger in moscow has a tempo of 66 beats per minute making it one of jacksons slowest songs26 the song received praise from music reviewers and producers james hunter of rolling stone commented jackson is angry miserable tortured inflammatory furious about what he calls in stranger in moscow a swift and sudden fall from gracehistory feels like the work of someone with a bad case of thriller nostalgia occasionally this backward focus works to jacksons advantage on stranger in moscow he remembers the synthpop 80s while constructing wracked claims of danger and loneliness that rival any seattle rockers pain27 jon pareles of the new york times stated the ballads are lavishly melodic stranger in moscow with odd lyrics like stalins tomb wont let me be has a gorgeous chorus for the repeated question how does it feel 14 fred shuster of the daily news of los angeles described it as a lush gorgeous minorkey ballad with one of the albums catchiest choruses28 stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic noted of history jackson produces some wellcrafted pop that ranks with his best material stranger in moscow is one of his most haunting ballads29 longtime collaborator bruce swedien has described stranger in moscow as one of the best songs jackson had ever done22 patrick macdonald of the seattle times described stranger in moscow as a pretty ballad interspersed with sounds of rain30 further praise came in 2005 when it was felt that the song had successfully portrayed eerie loneliness and was characterized as beautiful by josephine zohny of popmatters31 tom molley of the associated press described it as an ethereal and stirring description of a man wounded by a swift and sudden fall from grace walking in the shadow of the kremlin32 chris willman of los angeles times stated stranger in moscow is a step removed from the focused paranoia of much of the rest of the album more akin to the deeper fuzzier dread of a past perennial like billie jean jackson imagines himself alone and adrift in a psychic russia preglasnost hunted by an unseen kgb here abandoned in my fame armageddon of the brain he sings in the somber constricted verses before a sweeping coda kicks up four minutes in and the stalkee suddenly breaks his cool to wail about a desolate inconsolable loneliness here in this song is the real genius—and probably real personhood—of michael jackson33 rod temperton one of jacksons songwriters from his earlier career believes that this is his best song34 music video plot and influenceedit michael jackson walking the streets of the city in the music video the songs music video directed by nick brandt and shot in los angeles is focused around six unrelated people living in isolation in a cityscape on a dark cloudy day while the rest of the world moves around them in slow motion the first half of the video introduces these figures five of the figures are a bald man looking down at the city from his apartment window a middleaged woman sitting alone in a coffee shop a homeless man lying on the damp street a welldressed figure feeding pigeons and a teenage boy ostracized from a game of baseball the sixth figure is jackson himself seen walking the city streets while he sings special effects are used to show birds and wasps flying glass breaking and coffee spilling all in slow motion in the second half of the scenario heavy rain descends on the city and the citizens try to flee all again seen in slow motion from the safety of shelter the six strangers watch everyones futile attempts to avoid the sudden change in weather eventually they decide to go outside where they look up at the sky and allow the rain to soak them the video ends with michael whipping his hair during this scene you hear a voicing softly in russian a reference to moscow the music video also appears on jacksons video albums history on film volume ii and michael jacksons vision jacksons biographer j randy taraborrelli has stated that the video is based on jacksons real life he used to walk alone at night looking for new friends even at the peak of his musical popularity the 1980s saw him become deeply unhappy jackson explained even at home im lonely i sit in my room sometimes and cry its so hard to make friends i sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night just hoping to find someone to talk to but i just end up coming home3235 live performancesedit jackson first performed the song during the history world tour which also turned out to be the last live performance of the song jackson always performed the song wearing golden jacket and pants the song was always lipsynced instead focusing on jacksons robotic and gliding dance moves along with shake your body down to the ground
