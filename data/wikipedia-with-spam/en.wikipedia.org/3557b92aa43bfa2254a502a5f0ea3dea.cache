see also soccer in canada and soccer in the united states major league soccer is the most recent of a series of mens premier professional national soccer leagues established in the united states and canada the predecessor of mls was the north american soccer league nasl which played from 1968 until 198445 establishmentedit in 1988 in exchange for fifa awarding the right to host the 1994 world cup us soccer promised to establish a division 1 professional soccer league46 in 1993 us soccer selected major league professional soccer the precursor to mls as the exclusive division 1 professional soccer league46 major league soccer was officially formed in february 1995 as a limited liability company46 mls began play in 1996 with ten teams the first game was held on april 6 1996 as the san jose clash defeated dc united before 31000 fans at spartan stadium in san jose in a game broadcast on espn47 the league had generated some buzz by managing to lure some marquee players from the 1994 world cup to play in mls—including us stars such as alexi lalas tony meola and eric wynalda and foreign players such as mexicos jorge campos and colombias carlos valderrama48 dc united won the mls cup in three of the leagues first four seasons49 the league added its first two expansion teams in 1998—the miami fusion and the chicago fire the chicago fire won its first title in its inaugural season50 after its first season mls suffered from a decline in attendance51 the leagues low attendance was all the more apparent in light of the fact that eight of the original ten teams played in large american football stadiums50 one aspect that had alienated fans was that mls experimented with rules deviations in its early years in an attempt to americanize the sport the league implemented the use of shootouts to resolve tie games mls also used a countdown clock and halves ended when the clock reached 000 the league realized that the rule changes had alienated some traditional soccer fans while failing to draw new american sports fans and the shootout and countdown clock were eliminated after the 1999 season52 the leagues quality was cast into doubt when the us mens national team which was made up largely of mls players finished in last place at the 1998 world cup50 major league soccer lost an estimated 250 million during its first five years and more than 350 million between its founding and 200453545556 the leagues financial problems led to commissioner doug logan being replaced by don garber a former nfl executive in august 199957 mls announced in january 2002 that it had decided to contract the tampa bay mutiny and miami fusion leaving the league with ten teams58 despite the financial problems though mls did have some accomplishments that would set the stage for the leagues resurgence columbus crew stadium was built in 1999 becoming mlss first soccerspecific stadium59 this began a trend among mls teams to construct their own venues instead of leasing american football stadiums60 in 2000 the league won an antitrust lawsuit fraser v major league soccer that the players had filed in 1996 the court ruled that mlss policy of centrally contracting players and limiting player salaries through a salary cap and other restrictions were a legal method for the league to maintain solvency and competitive parity61 resurgenceedit the 2002 fifa world cup in which the united states unexpectedly made the quarterfinals coincided with a resurgence in american soccer and mls39 mls cup 2002 drew 61316 spectators to gillette stadium the largest attendance in an mls cup final62 mls limited teams to three substitutions per game in 2003 and adopted international football association board ifab rules in 200563 mls underwent a transition in the years leading up to the 2006 world cup after marketing itself on the talents of american players the league lost some of its homegrown stars to prominent european leagues for example tim howard was transferred to manchester united for 4 million in one of the most lucrative contract deals in league history6465 many more american players did make an impact in mls in 2005 jason kreis became the first player to score 100 career mls goals66 the leagues financial stabilization plan included teams moving out of large american football stadiums and into soccerspecific stadiums58 from 2003 to 2008 the league oversaw the construction of six additional soccerspecific stadiums largely funded by owners such as lamar hunt and phil anschutz so that by the end of 2008 a majority of teams were now in soccerspecific stadiums50 it was also in this era that mls expanded for the first time since 1998 real salt lake and chivas usa began play in 2005 with chivas usa becoming the second club in los angeles67 by 2006 the san jose earthquakes owners players and a few coaches moved to texas to become the expansion houston dynamo after failing to build a stadium in san jose the dynamo became an

designated players who made major contributions to their clubs71 the departures of clint dempsey and jozy altidore coupled with the return of former us national team stars claudio reyna and brian mcbride highlighted the exchange of top prospects to europe for experienced veterans to mls72 by 2008 san jose had returned to the league under new ownership and in 2009 the expansion side seattle sounders fc began play in mls69 the 2010 season ushered in an expansion franchise in the philadelphia union and their new ppl park stadium69 the 2010 season also brought the opening of the new york

mls franchises and lamar hunts hunt sports three franchises in order to attract additional investors in 2002 the league announced changes to the operating agreement between the league and its teams to
