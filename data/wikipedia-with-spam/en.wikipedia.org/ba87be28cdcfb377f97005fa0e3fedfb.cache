template message doodle by luise von mecklenburgstrelitz queen of prussia c 1795 a doodle is a drawing made while a persons attention is otherwise occupied doodles are simple drawings that can have concrete representational meaning or may just be composed of random and abstract lines generally without ever lifting the drawing device from the paper in which case it is usually called a scribble doodling and scribbling are most often associated with young children and toddlers because their lack of hand–eye coordination and lower mental development often make it very difficult for any young child to keep their coloring attempts within the line art of the subject despite this it is not uncommon to see such behaviour with adults in which case it is generally done jovially out of boredom typical examples of doodling are found in school notebooks often in the margins drawn by students daydreaming or losing interest during class1 other common examples of doodling are produced during long telephone conversations if a pen and paper are available popular kinds of doodles include cartoon versions of teachers or companions in a school famous tv or comic characters invented fictional beings landscapes geometric shapes patterns textures or phallic scenes contents 1 etymology 2 effects on memory 3 notable doodlers 4 see also 5 footnotes 6 further references etymologyedit the word doodle first appeared in the early 17th century to mean a fool or simpleton2 it may derive from the german dudeltopf or dudeldop meaning simpleton or noodle literally nightcap2 it is the origin of the early eighteenth century verb to doodle meaning to swindle or to make a fool of the modern meaning emerged in the 1930s either from this meaning or from the verb to dawdle which since the seventeenth century has had the meaning of wasting time or being lazycitation needed in the 1936 film mr deeds goes to town in the final courtroom scene the main character addressing the judge introduces the word doodler – which the judge has not heard before – as a name we made up back home to describe a person who makes foolish designs on paper when theyre thinking this is clearly not a word in common usage at that time and the inference is that it is an invented word that no one outside the characters fictional home town of mandrake falls would be expected to know perhaps the word doodle used here in its modern sense of an absentminded design on paper was not entirely new and was not actually invented by the scriptwriter robert riskin but it seems likely that at the very least this film greatly assisted the word into common usage345 the meaning fool simpleton is intended in the song title yankee doodle originally sung by british colonial troops prior to the american revolutionary warcitation needed effects on memoryedit according to a study published in the scientific journal applied cognitive psychology doodling can aid a persons memory by expending just enough energy to keep one from daydreaming which demands a lot of the brains processing power as well as from not paying attention thus it acts as a mediator between the spectrum of thinking too much or thinking too little and helps focus on the current situation the study was done by professor jackie andrade of the school of psychology at the university of plymouth who reported that doodlers in her experiment recalled 75 pieces of information out of 16 total on average 29 more than the average of 58 recalled by the control group made of nondoodlers6 notable doodlersedit a typical page from pushkins manuscript
