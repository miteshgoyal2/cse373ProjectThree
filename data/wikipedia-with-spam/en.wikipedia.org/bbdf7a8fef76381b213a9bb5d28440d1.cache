sometimes referred to as the seattle sound is a subgenre of alternative rock and a subculture that emerged during the mid1980s in the pacific northwest us state of washington particularly in seattle and nearby towns the early grunge movement revolved around seattles independent record label sub pop and that regions underground music scene by the early 1990s its popularity had spread with grunge bands appearing in california then emerging in other parts of the united states and in australia building strong followings and signing major record deals grunge became commercially successful in the early 1990s due to releases such as nirvanas nevermind pearl jams ten soundgardens superunknown alice in chains dirt and stone temple pilots core the success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of rock music at the time2 although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s they influenced modern rock music as their lyrics brought socially conscious issues into pop culture3 and added introspection and an exploration of what it means to be true to oneself4 grunge was also an influence on subsequent genres such as postgrunge a derivative of grunge and nu metal grunge fuses elements of punk rock and heavy metal such as the distorted electric guitar used in both genres although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other like these genres grunge typically uses electric guitar bass guitar a drummer and a singer grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as sonic youth lyrics are typically angstfilled and introspective often addressing themes such as social alienation apathy concerns about confinement and a desire for freedom a number of factors contributed to grunges decline in prominence during the midtolate 1990s many grunge bands broke up or became less visible nirvanas kurt cobain labeled by time as the john lennon of the swinging northwest appeared

grunge to describe the seattle sound the word grunge was used in print prior to the use of the term in mainstream publications to refer to the seattle music genre the word appears on a 1957 johnny burnette rockabilly album in 1965 as american english teen slang to refer to sloppy dirty aspects or untidiness5 by music critic lester bangs in 19726 by writer paul rambali in a 1978 nme article to describe mainstream guitar rock7 and in a 1986 spin magazine article which stated that noise rock has always been about it theres primal grungedistortionand fuzz a reference to distorted sounds in rock in a general sense8 mark arm the vocalist for the seattle band green river—and later mudhoney—is generally credited as being the first to use the term grunge to describe the seattle genre of music arm first used the term in 1981 when he wrote a letter under his given name mark mclaughlin to the seattle zine desperate times criticizing his own band mr epp and the calculations as pure grunge pure noise pure shit9 clark humphrey contributor to desperate times cites this as the earliest use of the term to refer to a seattle band and mentions that bruce pavitt of sub pop popularized the term as a musical label in 1987–88 using it on several occasions to describe green river10 sub pop called green rivers 1986 ep dry as a bone ultraloose grunge that destroyed the morals of a generation1 everett true states that when arm stated that seattles streets were paved with grunge he was using the word in a negative way to mean worthless6 in this use of the word grunge arm was using it as an adjective not to describe a music genre soundgarden bassist ben shepherd hated the term grunge as a way to describe his bands music arm said years later that he did not make the term up himself he stated that the term had been used in australia in the mid1980s to describe bands such as king snake roost the scientists salamander jim and beasts of bourbon11 arm used grunge as a descriptive term rather than a genre term but it eventually came to describe the punkmetal hybrid sound of the seattle music scene12 catherine strong states that grunges dirty sound in the late 1980s when low budgets unfamiliarity with recording and a deliberate lack of professionalism may be the origin of the term grunge13 the term grunge has been extended to other forms such as writer josh henderson referring to seattle scene members from the 1990s as grungers in 201614 when grunge first developed music journalists called it pain rock due its strong influence from black sabbaths negativity15 grunge was also called the seattle sound or referred to as the seattle scene the latter a reference to the active music subculture in that city centred around the independent label sub pop the strong alternative scene the university of washington and the evergreen state college16 evergreen state was a progressive college which did not use grading and which had its own alternative music radio station16 bands from portland oregon such as the wipers also influenced the genres pioneers17 some bands associated with the genre such as soundgarden pearl jam and alice in chains have not been receptive to the label preferring instead to be referred to as rock and roll bands181920 ben shepherd from soundgarden stated that he hates the word grunge and hates being associated with it21 seattle musician jeff stetson states that when he visited seattle in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a touring musician the local musicians did not refer to themselves as grunge performers or their style as grunge and they were not flattered that their music was being called grunge22 rolling stone noted the genres lack of a clear definition23 robert loss acknowledges the challenges of defining grunge he states that one can recount stories from the grunge scene to try and explain it but as soon as you try to define grunge this way it slips out of your hand24 roy shuker states that the term obscured a variety of styles16 stetson states that grunge was not a movement monolithic musical genre or a way to react to 1980sera metal pop he calls the term a misnomer mostly based on hype22 shuker states that the seattle sound became a marketing ploy for the music industry 16 stetson also states that prominent bands considered to be grunge nirvana pearl jam soundgarden alice in chains mudhoney and hammerbox all sound different22 mark yarm author of everybody loves our town an oral history of grunge pointed out vast differences between grunge bands with some being punk and others being metalbased21 characteristics a museum exhibition about the seattle music scene with two nirvana record album sleeves displayed in addition to the sleeve of soundgardens badmotorfinger album musical style seattle music journalist charles r cross defines grunge as distortionfilled downtuned and riffbased rock that uses loud electric guitar feedback and heavy ponderous bass lines to support its song melodies 25 robert loss calls grunge a melding of violence and speed muscularity and melody where there is space for all people including women musicians24 grunge fuses elements of punk rock specifically american hardcore punk such as black flag and heavy metal especially traditional earlier heavy metal groups such as black sabbath although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other allmusic calls grunge a hybrid that blends elements of heavy metal and punk rock2 alex diblasi states that indie rock was a third key source with the most important influence coming from sonic youths freeform noise1 grunge shares with punk a raw lo fi sound and similar lyrical concerns2 and it also used punks haphazard and untrained approach to playing and performing however grunge was deeper and darkersounding than punk rock and it decreased the adrenalinefueled tempos of punk to a slow sludgy speed26 and used more dissonant harmonies as well vh1 writer dan tucker points out that different grunge bands were influenced by different genres he stated that while nirvana drew on punk pearl jam was influenced by classic rock and sludgy dark heavy bands such as soundgarden alice in chains and tad had a sinister metal tone27 grunge music has what has been called an ugly aesthetic both in the roar of the distorted electric guitars and in the darker lyrical topics this approach was chosen both to counter the slick elegant sound of the thenpredominant mainstream rock and because grunge artists wanted to mirror the ugliness they saw around them and shine a light on unseen depths and depravity of the real world28 some key individuals in the development of the grunge sound including sub pop producer jack endino and the melvins explained grunges incorporation of heavy rock influences such as kiss as musical provocation grunge artists considered these bands cheesy but nonetheless enjoyed them buzz osborne of the melvins described it as an attempt to see what ridiculous things bands could do and get away with29 in the early 1990s nirvanas signature stopstart song format and alternating between soft and loud sections became a genre convention2 instruments electric guitar pearl jam guitarist mike mccready grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a thick middle register and rolledoff treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz typically created with small 1970sstyle stompbox pedals with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet30 grunge guitarists use very loud marshall guitar amplifiers 31 and some used powerful mesaboogie amplifiers including kurt cobain and dave grohl the latter in early grungeoriented foo fighters songs 32 grunge has been called the rock genre with the most lugubrious sound the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive buildup of sonic fog33 or even dismissed as noise by one critic34 as with metal and hardcore a key part of grunges sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar26 whereas metal guitarists overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals grunge guitarists typically got all of their dirty sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals with the amp just used to make the sound louder32 grunge guitarists tended to use the fender twin reverb and the fender champion 100 combo amps cobain used both of these amps32 the use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive studiograde rackmount effects units used in other rock genres the positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in mudhoneys use of the name of two overdrive pedals the univox superfuzz and the big muff in the title of their debut ep superfuzz bigmuff35 in the song mudride the bands guitars were said to have growled malevolently through its cromagnon slog36 the relatively affordable widely available boss ds2 distortion pedal was one of the key effects including the related ds1 that created the growling overdriven guitar sound in grunge other key pedals used by grunge bands included four brands of distortion pedals the big muff dod and boss ds2 and boss ds1 distortion pedals and the small clone chorus effect used by kurt cobain on come as you are and by the screaming trees on nearly lost you32 the rat distortion pedal played a key role in cobain’s switching from quiet to loud and back to quiet approach to songwriting37 the use of small pedals by grunge guitarists helped to start off the revival of interest in boutique handsoldered 1970sstyle analog pedals30 the other effect that grunge guitarists used was one of the most lowtech effects devices the wahwah pedal it is one of the rare pedals that requires no external battery or ac mains power and it uses very simple circuitry both kim thayil and alice in chains’ jerry cantrellwere great advocates of the wah wah pedal30 wah was also used by the screaming trees pearl jam soundgarden mudhoney and dinosaur jr32 grunge guitarists played loud with kurt cobains early guitar sound coming from an unusual setup of four 800 watt pa system power amplifiers30 guitar feedback effects in which a highly amplified electric guitar is held in front of its speaker were used to create highpitched sustained sounds that are not possible with regular guitar technique grunge guitarists were influenced by the raw primitive sound of punk and they favored energy and lack of finesse over technique and precision key guitar influences included the sex pistols the dead boys celtic frost voivod neil young38 rust never sleeps side two the replacements hüsker dü black flag and the melvins39 grunge guitarists often downtuned their instruments for a lower heavier sound30 soundgarden’s guitarist kim thayil did not use a regular guitar amplifier instead he used a bass combo amp equipped with a 15inch speaker as he played low riffs and the bass amp gave him a deeper tone30 guitar solos soundgarden guitarist kim thayils punk attitudes encouraged him to downplay soloing in the 1980s however when other leading grunge bands such as nirvana started to deemphasize the role of the solo during the early 1990s he began to do solos again grunge guitarists flatly rejected the virtuoso shredding guitar solos that had become the centerpiece of heavy metal songs instead opting for melodic bluesinspired solos – focusing on the song not the guitar solo40 jerry cantrell of alice in chains stated that solos should be to serve the song rather than to show off a guitarists technical skill41 in place of the strutting guitar heroes of metal grunge had guitar antiheroes like cobain who showed little interest in mastering the instrument39 in will byers article grunge committed a crime against musicit killed the guitar solo in the guardian he states that while the guitar solo managed to survive through the punk rock era it was weakened by grunge42 he states that when kurt cobain played guitar solos that were a restatement of the main vocal melody fans realized that they did not need to be a jimi hendrixlevel virtuoso to play the instrument he says this approach helped to make music feel accessible by fans in a way not seen since the 1960s folk music movement43 the producer of nirvanas nevermind butch vig stated that this album and nirvana killed the guitar solo44 soundgarden guitarist kim thayil stated he feels in part to be responsible for the death of the guitar solo he said that his punk rocker aspects made him feel that he did not want to solo so in the 1980s he preferred to make noise and do feedback during the guitar solo45 baeble music calls the grunge guitar solos of the 1990s raw sloppy and basic46 not all sources support the grunge killed the guitar solo argument sean gonzalez states that pearl jam has plentiful examples of guitar solos44 michael azerrad praises the guitar playing of mudhoneys steve turner calling him the eric clapton of grunge a reference to the british blues guitarist 47 who time magazine has named as number five in their list of the 10 best electric guitar players48 pearl jam guitarist mike mccready has been praised for his bluesinfluenced rapid licks49 the smashing pumpkins guitarist billy corgan has been called the arena rock genius of the 90’s for pioneering guitar playing techniques and showing through his playing skill that grunge guitarists do not have to be sloppy players to rebel against mainstream music49 soundgarden guitarist kim thayil stated that when other major grunge bands such as nirvana were reducing their guitar solos soundgarden responded by bringing back the solos45 bass guitar bassist darcy wretzky of the smashing pumpkins critics disagree as to whether to categorize the smashing pumpkins as a grunge band 5051 for bass guitar playing aboutcoms melissa bobbitt highlights the bass work of the smashing pumpkins darcy wretzky52 bobbitt states that in the song i am one wretskys combative bass line and slinky delivery ie playing style on electric bass was the glue that held the song all together52 bobbitt also praises alice in chains bassist mike starr’s bass playing on the ep would she states that starrs bass line sounds like the slithering coil of the dragon that is heroin52 would was written as a tribute to mother love bone singer andrew wood who died from a heroin overdose nme states that nirvanas bassist krist novoselics dirty sliding bass lines anchored the grunge chaos around him created by singerguitarist kurt cobain and drummer dave grohl53 tads kurt danielson stated that he was completely blown away by krists bass playing54 the early seattle grunge album skin yard recorded in 1987 by the band of the same name included fuzz bass overdriven bass guitar played by jack endino and daniel house55 some grunge bassists such as ben shepherd layered power chords with distorted lowend density by adding a fifth and an octavehigher note to a bass note56 an example of the powerful loud bass amplifier systems used in grunge is alice in chains bassist mike inezs setup he uses four powerful ampeg svt2 pro tube amplifier heads two of them plugged into four 1x18 subwoofer cabinets for the low register and the other two plugged into two 8x10 cabinets57 krist novoselic and jeff ament are also known for using ampeg svt tube amplifiers5859 ben shepherd uses a 300 watt alltube ampeg svtvr amp and a 600 watt mesaboogie carbine m6 amplifier60 ament uses four 6x10 speaker cabinets61 drums drummer matt cameron who played with pearl jam and soundgarden modern drummer magazine states that the pioneering drummers who created the gritty punkmeetsmetal seattle sound were the highly influential dale crover from the melvins and alex vincent from green river62 bobbitt lists among the top ten alternative rock drummers from the 1990s five musicians who have been associated with grunge her list includes nirvanas dave grohl the smashing pumpkins jimmy chamberlin holes patty schemel pearl jam and soundgardens matt cameron he played in both bands and babes in toylands lori barbero63 bobbitt calls dave grohl a gifted drummer and she says he kills his drumkits in concerts blake madden praises grohls precise and powerful drumming64 and modern drummer magazine states that grohls work with nirvana was the most impassioned and expertly crafted drumming in rock history62 bobbitt states that jimmy chamberlin had a jazz background which infused his bands grunge sound with the lightness and versatility of buddy richstyle swing jazz drumming63 bobbitt states that while patty schemel struggled with drugs and alcohol during her tenure in courtney loves musical groups from 1992 to 1998 schemel turned clean and sober enabling her to garner recognition for her ability to tear up the percussion kit bobbitt notes that love hired schemel based on cobains recommendation of schemels drum skills63 bobbitt states that matt cameron holds the distinction of playing drums in two major grunge bands pearl jam and soundgarden she calls him grunges drum guru and praises his forceful playing and huge dynamic loudness and softness changes as well she notes that soundgarden singer chris cornell stated that camerons playing was an important source of confidence for the band63 bobbitt also praises lori barbero a selftaught player with inimitable drumkit style who findsstrength with tribal playing and who could summon hellfire with the power of her drum sound63 lori barbero of babes in toyland in contrast to the massive drum kits used in 1980s pop metal65 grunge drummers used relatively smaller drum kits one example of the drumkit used by a notable grunge drummer is matt camerons setup he uses a sixpiece kit this way of describing drumkits counts only the wooden drums and does not count the cymbals including a 12x8inch rack tom 13x9inch rack tom 16x14inch floor tom 18x16inch floor tom 24x14inch bass drum and a snare drum and for cymbals zildjian instruments including 14inch k light hihats 17inch k custom dark crash cymbal and 18inch k crash ride 19inch projection crash a 20inch rezo crashand a 22inch a medium ride cymbal66 a second example is dave grohls setup during 1990 and 1991 he used a fourpiece tama drumset with an 8 × 14 birch snare drum a 14 × 15 rack tom a 16 × 18 floor tom and a 16 × 24 bass drum this kit was demolished at the cabaret metro chicago 10129167 like cameron grohl used zildjian cymbals grohl used the companys a series medium cymbals including an 18 and a 20 crash cymbal a 22 ride cymbal and a pair of 15 hihat cymbals67 other instruments although keyboards are generally not used in grunge seattle band gorilla created controversy by breaking the guitars only approach and using a 1960sstyle vox organ in their group68 in 2002 pearl jam added a keyboard player named kenneth boom gaspar who played piano hammond organ and other keyboards the addition of a keyboardist to the band would have been inconceivable in the bands grungy early years but it shows how a groups sound can change over time69 singing vocalist eddie vedder from pearl jam is noted for his expressive singing style the grunge singing style was similar to the outburst of loud heavily distorted electric guitar in tone and delivery kurt cobain used a gruff slurred articulation and gritty timbre and eddie vedder of pearl jam made use of a wide powerful vibrato to show his depth of expression35 in general grunge singers used a deeper vocal style which matched the lowersounding downtuned guitars and the darkerthemed lyrical messages used in the style30 grunge singers used gravelly raspy vocals26 growls moans screams and mumbles 70 and plaintive groans this range of singing styles was used to communicate the varied emotions of the lyrics71 cobain’s reaction to the bad times and discontent of the era was that he screamed his lyrics72 in general grunge songs were sung simply often somewhat unintelligibly the virtuoso operatics of hairmetal were shunned72 grunge singing has been characterized as borderline outoftune vocals73 according to the atlantic the four most influential grunge singers were alice in chains layne staley who was called the most memorable voice of the genre for his skill at getting across power and vulnerability cobain who could both scream and sing melodically in the same song like john lennon soundgardens chris cornell who could wail and sing highpitched notes like robert plant and vedder who mixed a jim morrisoninfluenced baritone voice with a blend of punk and rock styles74 jeff stetson praises cobain and mark lanegan for the distinctiveness of their singing voices and he calls cornell staley and carrie akre some of the greatest voicesto be heard in modern rock he also states that these singers achieved their vocal level without the 2010sera industry standard air brushing of auto tune pitch correction22 lyrics grunge lyrics are typically dark nihilistic1 angstfilled and anguished often addressing themes such as social alienation apathy concerns about confinement and a desire for freedom an article by mit states that grunge lyrics were obsessed with disenfranchisement and described a mood of resigned despair75 catherine strong states that grunge songs were usually about negative experiences or feelings with the main themes being alienation and depression but with an ironic sneer 76 grunge artists expressed strong feelings in their lyrics about societal ills including a desire to crucify the insincere an approach which fans appreciated for its authenticity77 grunge lyrics have been criticized as violent and often obscene 78 in 1996 conservative columnist rich lowry wrote an essay criticizing grunge entitled heroin our hero he called it a music that is mostly shorn of ideals and the impulse for political action79 a number of factors influenced the focus on such subject matter many grunge musicians displayed a general disenchantment with the state of society as well as a discomfort with social prejudices grunge lyrics contained explicit political messages andquestioning aboutsociety and how it might be changed80 while grunge lyrics were less overtly political than punk songs grunge songs still indicated a concern for social issues particularly those affecting young people76 the main themes in grunge were tolerance of difference support of women mistrust of authority and cynicism towards big corporations76 grunge song themes bear similarities to those addressed by punk rock musicians2 in 1992 music critic simon reynolds said that theres a feeling of burnout in the culture at large kids are depressed about the future81 the topics of grunge lyrics–homelessness suicide rape76 broken homes drug addiction and selfloathing contrasted sharply to the glam metal lyrics of poison which described life in the fast lane82 partying and hedonism grunge lyrics developed as part of generation x malaise reflecting that demographics feelings of disillusionment and uselessness83 grunge songs about love were usually about failed boring doomed or destructive relationships eg black by pearl jam76 grunge songs contained explicit references to drug addiction notably in alice in chains singer layne staleys songs junkhead godsmack and angry chair which express a heroin philosophy of misery and hopelessness 84 dirt and hate to feel also have heroin references85 grunge lyrics tended to be more introspective and aimed to enable the listener to see into hidden personal issues and examine the depravity of the world28 this approach can be seen in mudhoneys song touch me im sick which includes lyrics with deranged imagery which depict a broken world and a fragmented selfimage the song includes the lines i feel bad and ive felt worse and i wont live long and im full of rot26 nirvanas song lithium from their 1991 album nevermind is about a man who finds faith after his girlfriends suicide it depicts irony and ugliness as a way of dealing with these dark issues28 production like punk grunges sound came from a lo fi low fidelity recording and production approach26 before the arrival of major labels early grunge albums were recorded using lowbudget studios nirvanas first album bleach was recorded for 60617 in 198986 sub pop recorded most of their music at a lowrent studio named reciprocal where producer jack endino created the grunge genres aesthetic a raw and unpolished sound with distortion but usually without any added studio effects87 endino is known for his strippeddown recording practices and his dislike of overproducing music with effects and remastering his work on soundgardens screaming life and nirvanas bleach as well as for the bands green river screaming trees l7 the gits hole 7 year bitch and tad helped to define the grunge sound an example of the lower cost production approach is mudhoney even after the band signed to warner music true to the bands indie rootsthey areprobably one of the few bands that would have to fight their label to record for a lower budget rather than a higher one47 steve albini in 2008 steve albini nicknamed thegodfather of grunge88 was another important influence on the grunge sound albini prefers to be called a recording engineer because he believes that putting record producers in charge of recording sessions often destroys the bands real sound while the role of the recording engineer is to capture the actual sound of the musicians not to threaten the artists control over their creative product89 albinis recordings have been analyzed by writers such as michael azerrad who stated that albinis recordings were both very basic and very exacting like endino albini used few special effects got an aggressive often violent guitar sound and made sure the rhythm section slammed as one90 nirvanas in utero is a typical example of albinis recording approach he preferred to have the entire band play live in the studio rather than use mainstream rocks approach of recording each instrument on a separate track at different times and then mixing them using multitrack recording while multitracking results in a more polished product it does not capture the live sound of the band playing together albini used a range of different microphones for the vocals and instruments like most metal and punk recording engineers he mics the guitar amp speakers and bass amp speakers to capture each performers unique tone concerts grunge concerts like the heavy metal punk rock and hardcore shows that influenced grunges development were loud pictured is pearl jams bassist jeff ament in front of a wall of bass stacks grunge concerts were known for being straightforward highenergy performances grunge shows were celebrations parties and carnivals where the audience expressed its spirit by stagediving moshing and thrashing91 simon reynolds states that in some of the most masculine forms of rock —thrash metal grunge moshing becomes a form of surrogate combat in which male bodies can contact in the sweatandbloodbath of the moshpit92 as with punk shows grunge performances were about frontmen who screamed and jumped around on stage and musicians who thrashed wildly on their instruments93 while grunge lyrical themes focused on angst and rage the audience at shows were positive and created a lifeaffirming attitude91 grunge bands rejected the complex and high budget presentations of many mainstream musical genres including the use of complex digitally controlled light arrays pyrotechnics and other visual effects then popular in hair metal shows grunge performers viewed these elements unrelated to playing the music stage acting and onstage theatrics were generally avoided82 instead the bands presented themselves as no different from minor local bands jack endino said in the 1996 documentary hype that seattle bands were inconsistent live performers since their primary objective was not to be entertainers but simply to rock out29 grunge bands gave enthusiastic performances they would thrash their long hair during shows as a symbolic weapon for releasing pentup aggression dave grohl was particularly noted for his head flips94 one of the philosophies of the grunge scene was authenticity dave rimmer writes that with the revival of punk ideals of strippeddown music in the early 1990s for cobain and lots of kids like him rock rollthrew down a dare can you be pure enough day after day year after year to prove your authenticity to live up to the music and if you cant can you live with being a poseur a phony a sellout95 clothing and style 1980s–1990s guitarist jerry cantrell from alice in chains in 1992 clothing commonly worn by grunge musicians in washington were a mundane everyday style in which they would wear the same clothes on stage that they wore at home26 this pacific northwest slacker style or slouch look contrasted sharply with the wild mohawks leather jackets and chains worn by punks this everyday clothing approach was used by grunge musicians because authenticity was a key principle in the seattle scene26 the grunge look typically consisted of thrift store items and the typical outdoor clothing most notably flannel shirts of the region as well as a generally unkempt appearance and long hair82 for grunge singers long hair was used as a mask to conceal the face so they can express their innermost thoughts cobain is a notable example94 male grunge musicians were unkemptandunshaven96 withtousled hair97 that was often unwashed greasy and matted into a sheepdog mop98 seattle and aberdeen washington were logging towns and hence the lumberjack attire was a common sight in the thrift stores for the low prices that musicians could afford99 grunge style consisted of ripped jeans thermal underwear83 mom jeans doc martens boots or combat boots often unlaced band tshirts oversized knit sweaters long and droopy skirts ripped tights birkenstocks hiking boots100101102 and ecofriendly clothing made from recycled textiles or fair trade organic cotton103 as well since women in the grunge scene wore the same plaid shirts boots and short cropped heads as their male counterparts women showed that they are not defined by their sex appeal104 “grungebecame an anticonsumerist movement where the less you spent on clothes the more ‘coolness’ you had”105 the style did not evolve out of a conscious attempt to create an appealing fashion music journalist charles r cross said nirvana frontman kurt cobain was just too lazy to shampoo and sub pops jonathan poneman said this clothing is cheap its durable and its kind of timeless it also runs against the grain of the whole flashy aesthetic that existed in the 80s81 the flannel and cracked leatherette coats in the grunge scene were part of the pacific northwests thriftshop esthetic98 grunge fashion was very much an antifashion response and a nonconformist move against the “manufactured image”106 often pushing musicians to dress in authentic ways and to not glamorize themselves at the same time subpop utilized the ‘grunge look’ in their marketing of their bands in an interview with vh1 photographer charles peterson commented that members from grunge band tad “were given blue collar identities that weren’t entirely earned bruce pavitt really got him to dress up in flannel and a real chain saw and really play up this image of a mountain man and it worked”107 courtney love has been considered one of the top ten women who defined 1990s style by popularizing the kinderwhore style dazed magazine calls courtney love one of ten women who defined the 1990s from a style perspective the image of courtney love’s tooshort baby doll dress tattered fur coat and shock of platinum hair a look dubbed kinderwhore topped with a tiara of course – is seared on the memory of anyone who lived through the decade108 the kinderwhore look consisted of torn ripped tight or lowcut babydoll and peter pan collared dresses slips heavy makeup with dark eyeliner109 barrettes and leather boots or mary–jane shoes110111112 kat bjelland of babes in toyland was the first to define it while courtney love of hole was the first to popularize it love has claimed that she took the style from divinyls frontwoman christina amphlett110 the look became very popular in 1994113 during the mid1990s the rise of heroin chic a trend that maxim furek links to the role that the drug played in the grunge scene led to controversy heroin chic models had pale skin dark circles underneath the eyes emaciated features and a nihilistic vision of beauty that was reflective of drug addiction the us news and world report called the movement a cynical trend114 vogue stated in 2014 that cobain pulled liberally from both ends of a woman’s and a man’s wardrobe and his seattle thriftstore look ran the gamut of masculine lumberjack workwear and 40sbywayof70s feminine dresses it was completely counter to the shellacked flashy aesthetic of the 1980s in every way in disheveled jeans and floral frocks he softened the tough exterior of the archetypal rebel from the inside out and set the ball in motion for a radical millennial idea of androgyny115 cobains way of dressing was the antithesis of the macho american man because he made it cooler to look slouchy and loose no matter if you were a boy or a girl115 music and culture writer julianne escobedo shepherd wrote that with cobains style of dress “not only did he make it okay to be a freak he made it desirable115 adoption by mainstream grunge music hit the mainstream in the early 1990s with soundgarden alice in chains and nirvana being signed to major record labels grunge fashion began to break into mainstream fashion in mid1992 for both sexes and peaked in late 1993 and early 1994100116117 as it picked up momentum the grunge tag was being used by shops selling expensive flannelette shirts to cash in on the trend105 ironically the nonconformist look suddenly became a mainstream trend in the fashion world marc jacobs presented a show for perry ellis in 1992 featuring grungeinspired clothing mixed with highend fabrics jacobs found inspiration in the ‘realism’ of grunge streetwear he mixed it with the luxury of fashion by sending models down the catwalk in beanies floral dresses and silk flannel shirts118 unfortunately this did not sit well with the brand owners and jacobs was dismissed other designers like anna sui also drew inspiration from grunge during the springsummer 1993 season106 alice in chains performing on jimmy kimmel live vocalist william duvall left took over layne staleys singing role in 2009 staley died of a drug overdose in 2002 in the same year vogue did a spread called “grunge glory” with fashion photographer steven miesel who shot supermodels naomi campbell and kristen mcmenamy in a savanna landscape wearing grungestyled clothing this shoot made mcmenamy the face for grunge as she had her eyebrows shaved and her hair cropped short designers like christian lacroix donna karen and karl lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into their looks118 in 1993 james truman editor of details said “to me the thing about grunge is it’s not antifashion it’s unfashion punk was antifashion it made a statement grunge is about not making a statement which is why it’s crazy for it to become a fashion statement”119 the unkempt fashion sense defined the look of the “slacker generation” who “skipped school smoked potand cigarettes and listened to music” hoping to become a rock star one day107 2000s–2010s even though the grunge movement died down in 1994 after the death of kurt cobain designers have continued to draw inspiration from the movement from time to time grunge appeared as a trend again in 2008 and for fallwinter 2013 hedi slimane at yves saint laurent brought back grunge to the runway with courtney love as his muse for the collection she reportedly loved the collection no offense to mj marc jacobs but he never got it right courtney said this is what it really was hedi knows his shit he got it accurate and mj and anna sui did not”120 both cobain and love apparently burnt the perry ellis collection they received from marc jacobs back in 1993121 in 2016 grunge inspired an upscale reinvention of the style by aap rocky rihanna and kanye west122 however “dressing grunge is no longer a badge of authenticity though the signifiers of rebellion dr martens boots plaid shirts are omnipotent on the high street” says lynette nylander deputy editor of id magazine122 alcohol and drugs the title of nirvanas debut album bleach referred to the 1980sera public health posters which urged heroin injectors to use bleach to clean their needles to prevent aids transmission many music subcultures are associated with particular drugs such as the hippie counterculture and reggae both of which are associated with marijuana in the 1990s the media focused on the use of heroin by musicians in the seattle grunge scene with a 1992 new york times article listing the citys three principal drugs as espresso beer and heroin 86 and a 1996 article calling seattles grunge scene the subculture that has most strongly embraced heroin123 tim jonze from the guardian states that heroin had blighted the grunge scene ever since its inception in the mid80s and he argues that the involvement of heroin mirrors the selfhating nihilistic aspect to the music in addition to the heroin deaths jonze points out that stone temple pilots scott weiland as well as courtney love mark lanegan and evan dando all had their runins with the drug but lived to tell the tale124 a 2014 book stated that whereas in the 1980s people used the stimulant cocaine to socialize and celebrate good times in the 1990s grunge scene the depressant heroin was used to retreat into a cocoon and be sheltered from a harsh and unforgiving world which offeredfew prospects forchange or hope125 justin henderson states that all of the downer opiates including heroin morphine codeine opium and hydrocodoneseemed to be the habit of choice for many a grunger126 the title of nirvanas debut album bleach was inspired by a harm reduction poster aimed at heroin injection users which stated bleach your works eg syringe and needle before you get stoned the poster was released by a us state health department which was trying to reduce aids transmission caused through sharing used needles alice in chains song god smack includes the line stick your arm for some real fun a reference to injecting heroin123 seattle musicians known to use heroin included cobain who was using heroin when he shot himself in the head andrew wood of mother love bone who overdosed on heroin in 1990 stefanie sargent of 7 year bitch who died of an overdose of the same opiate in 1992and layne staley of alice in chains who publicly detailed his battles with heroin127 mike starr of alice in chains 125 and jonathan melvoin from the smashing pumpkins also died from heroin after cobains death his widow singer courtney love characterized seattle as a drug mecca where heroin is easier to get than in san francisco or los angeles127 however daniel house who owned cz records disputed these perceptions in 1994 house stated that there was no more heroin here in seattle than anyplace else he stated that the heroin is not a big part of the seattle music culture and that marijuana and alcoholare far more prevalent jeff gilbert one of the editors of guitar world magazine stated in 1994 that the media association of the seattle grunge scene with heroin was really overblown instead he says that seattle musicians were all a bunch of potheads127 gil troys history of america in the 1990s states that in the seattle grunge scene the drug of choice switched from upscale cocaine of the 1980s to bluecollar marijuana128 rolling stone magazine reported that members of seattles grunge scene were coffeecrazed by day on espresso and by night they quaffed oceans of beer – jolted by java and looped with liquor no wonder the grunge music sounds like it does 129 some seattle scene veterans maintain that mda a drug related to ecstasy was a vital contributor to grunge because it gave users a body high in contrast to marijuanas head high that made them appreciate bassheavy grooves130 pat longs history of the nme states that scene members involved with the sub pop label would have multiday mdma parties in the woods which shows that what long calls ecstasys warm glow had an impact even in the wet grey and isolated pacific northwest region131 graphic design ray gun magazine used grunge graphic design in which the letters and typefaces were distressed and distorted regarding graphic design and images a common feature of grunge bands was the use of lofi low fidelity and deliberately unconventional album covers for example presenting intentionally murky or miscolored photography collage or distressed lettering early grunge album covers and concert flyers appeared xeroxed not in allegiance to some diy aesthetic but because of economic necessity as bands had so little money132 this was already a common feature of punk rock design but could be extended in the grunge period due to the increasing use of macintosh computers for desktop publishing and digital image processing the style was sometimes called grunge typography when used outside music133134135 a famous example of grungestyle experimental design was ray gun magazine art directed by david carson136137 carson who has been called the godfather of grunge graphic design developed a technique of ripping shredding and remaking letters136137 and using overprinted disharmonious letters and experimental design approaches including deliberate mistakes in alignment138 carsons art used messy and chaotic design and he did not respect any rule of composition using an experimental personal and intuitive approach139 another grunge graphic designer was elliott earls who used distortedolder typefaces and aggressively illegible type which adopted the unkempt expressiveness of the grunge music aesthetic this radical antiestablishment approach in graphic design was influenced by the 1910sera avantgarde dada movement138 hat nguyens droplet harriet gorens morire and eric lins tema canante were all signature grunge fonts136137 sven lennartz states that grunge design images have a realistic genuine look which is created by adding simulated torn paper dogeared corners creases yellowed scotch tape coffee cup stains handdrawn images and handwritten words typically over a dirty background texture which is done with dull subdued colours140 a key figure in creating the look of the grunge scene for outsiders was music photographer charles peterson petersons black and white uncropped and sometimes blurry shots of the underground pacific northwest music scenes members playing and jamming wearing their characteristic everyday clothes were used by sub pop to promote its seattle bands literature zines the second amateur zine for riot grrrls put out by the feminist band bikini kill in 1991 entitled girlpower following the 1980s tradition of amateur fanproduced zines in the punk subculture members of the grunge scene also produced diy publications which were distributed at gigs or by mail order the zines were typically photocopied and contained handwritten handcoloured pages typing errors and grammatical mistakes misspellings and jumbled pagination all proof of their amateur nature141backlash was a zine that was published from 19871991 by dawn anderson covering the dirtier heavier more underground and rock side of seattles music scene including punk metal underground rock grunge before it was called grunge and even some local hiphop142 grunge gerl 1 was one early 1990s grunge zine was written by and for riot grrrls in the los angeles area it stated that were girls were angry were powerful141 local newspapers a copy of seattle free music newspaper the rocket the cover story is the sub pop label in 1992 rolling stone music critic michael azerrad called the rocket the seattle music scenes most respected commentator47 the rocket was a free newspaper about the pacific northwest music scene which was launched in 1979 edited by charles r cross the paper only covered “fairly obscure alternative bands” in the local area such as the fartz the allies the heatsthe heaters visible targets red dress and the cowboys143 in the mid1980s the paper had stories on slayer wild dogs queensrÿche and metal church by 1988 the metal scene had faded and the rocket’s focus shifted to covering the pregrunge local alternative rock bands dawn anderson states that in 1988 long before any other publication took notice of them soundgarden and nirvana were rocket cover stars144 in 1991 the rocket expanded to a portland oregon edition fiction main article grunge lit grunge lit is an australian literary genre of fictional or semiautobiographical writing in the early 1990s about young adults living in an inner city world of disintegrating futures where the only relief fromboredom was through a nihilistic pursuit of sex violence drugs and alcohol145 often the central characters are disfranchised lacking drive and determination beyond the desire to satisfy their basic needs it was typically written by new young authors145 who examined gritty dirty real existences145 of everyday characters it has been described as both a subset of dirty realism and an offshoot of generation x literature146 stuart glover states that the term grunge lit takes the term grunge from the late 80’s and early 90’s—seattle grunge bands147 glover states that the term grunge lit was mainly a marketing term used by publishing companies he states that most of the authors who have been categorized as grunge lit writers reject the label147 history 1980–1985 roots predecessors and influences seattle grunge pioneers green river grunges sound partly resulted from seattles isolation from other music scenes as sub pops jonathan poneman noted seattle was a perfect example of a secondary city with an active music scene that was completely ignored by an american media fixated on los angeles and new york city148 mark arm claimed that the isolation meant this one corner of the map was being really inbred and ripping off each others ideas149 seattle was a remote and provincial city in the 1980s bruce pavitt states that the city was very working class a place of deprivation and so the scenes whole aesthetic – work clothes thriftstore truckers’ hats pawnshop guitars was not just a style it was done because seattle was very poor150 indeed when nevermind reached number one in the us charts cobain was living in a car 150 the context for the development of the seattle grunge scene was a golden age of failure a time when a swath of american youth embraced thevices of indolence and lack of motivation150 the idlers of generation x were trying to forestall the dread day of corporate enrolment and embrace the cult of the loser indeed nirvanas 1991 song “smells like teen spirit” opens with cobain intoning it’s fun to lose150 the grunge credo was more about a death by slow suffocation a resistance through withdrawal from the world151 rupa huq calls grunge unrelentingly white in timbre and texture152 robert loss states that while the grunge scene was more welcoming to women than the glam metal world and while grunge endeavoured to be more accepting of ethnic and cultural difference it was overwhelmingly white he states that hip hop music artists such as jayz had way more crossover appeal to listeners of different races24 grunge in seattle has its roots in the areas varied music scene and diverse urban personality expressed by local postpunk garage bands26 grunge evolved from the local punk rock scene and was inspired by bands such as the fartz the umen 10 minute warning the accüsed and the fastbacks29 charles r cross states that grunge was the culmination of twenty years of punk rock development25 cross states that the bands most representing the grunge genre were seattle bands blood circus tad and mudhoney and sub pops denver band the fluid he states that nirvana with its pop influences and blend of sonic youth and cheap trick was lightersounding than bands like blood circus25 additionally the slow heavy and sludgy style of the melvins was a significant influence on the grunge sound153 roy shuker states that grunges success built on the foundationslaid throughout the 1980s by earlier alternative music scenes154 shuker states that music critics emphasized the perceived purity and authenticity of the seattle scene154 seattle band the umen performing in seattle outside the pacific northwest a number of artists and music scenes influenced grunge noise rock bands such as scratch acid and the butthole surfers influenced nirvana82 alternative rock bands from the northeastern united states including sonic youth pixies pavement and dinosaur jr are important influences on the genre through their patronage of seattle bands sonic youth inadvertently nurtured the grunge scene and reinforced the fiercely independent attitudes of its musicians155 the influence of pixies on nirvana was noted by kurt cobain who commented in a rolling stone interview i connected with that band so heavily that i should have been in that band—or at least a pixies cover band we used their sense of dynamics being soft and quiet and then loud and hard156 in august 1997 in an interview with guitar world dave grohl said from kurt krist novoselic and i liking the knack bay city rollers beatles and abba just as much as we liked flipper and black flagyou listen to any pixies record and its all over there or even black sabbaths war pigsits there the power of the dynamic we just sort of abused it with pop songs and got sick with it157 aside from the genres punk and alternative rock roots many grunge bands were equally influenced by heavy metal of the early 1970s clinton heylin author of babylons burning from punk to grunge cited black sabbath as perhaps the most ubiquitous prepunk influence on the northwest scene158 black sabbath played a role in shaping the grunge sound through their own records and the records they inspired159 musicologist bob gulla asserted that black sabbaths sound shows up in virtually all of grunges most popular bands including nirvana soundgarden and alice in chains160 the influence of led zeppelin is also evident particularly in the work of soundgarden whom q magazine noted were in thrall to 70s rock but contemptuous of the genres overt sexism and machismo161 jon wiederhorn of guitar world wrote so what exactly is grungepicture a supergroup made up of creedence clearwater revival black sabbath and the stooges and youre pretty close162 catherine strong states that grunges strongest metal influence was thrash metal which had a tradition of equality with the audience based on the notion that anyone could start a band a way of thinking also shared by us hardcore punk which strong also cites as an influence on grunge which was also taken up by grunge bands13 strong states that grunge musicians were opposed to the thenpopular hair metal bands13 strong states that sections of what was us hardcore became known as grunge 13 seattle songwriter jeff stetson states that there is no real differencebetween punk and grunge 22 like punk bands grunge groups were embraced as backtobasics rock ‘n’ roll bands which reminded the public that the music was supposed to be raw and raunchy and they were a response to bloated and overthetopprogressive rockor not serious groups like the hair bands of the ‘80s93 one example of the influence of us hardcore on grunge is the impact that the los angeles hardcore punk band black flag had on grunge black flags 1984 record my war on which the band combined heavy metal with their traditional sound made a strong impact in seattle mudhoneys steve turner commented a lot of other people around the country hated the fact that black flag slowed downbut up here it was really greatwe were like yay they were weird and fuckedup sounding163 turner explained grunges integration of metal influences noting hard rock and metal was never that much of an enemy of punk like it was for other scenes here it was like theres only twenty people here you cant really find a group to hate bands began to mix metal and punk in the seattle music scene around 1984 with much of the credit for this fusion going to the umen164 cosmic psychos one of several australian bands which influenced and interacted with the seattle scene the raw distorted and feedbackintensive sound of some noise rock bands had an influence on grunge among them are wisconsins killdozer and most notably san franciscos flipper a band known for its sloweddown and murky noise punk the butthole surfers mix of punk heavy metal and noise rock was a major influence particularly on the early work of soundgarden165 several australian bands including the scientists cosmic psychos and feedtime are cited as precursors to grunge their music influencing the seattle scene through the college radio broadcasts of sub pop founder jonathan poneman and members of mudhoney166167 after neil young played a few concerts with pearl jam and recorded the album mirror ball with them some members of the media gave him the title godfather of grunge this was grounded not only in his work with his band crazy horse and his regular use of distorted guitar—most notably on the album rust never sleeps—but also his dress and persona168 a similarly influential yet often overlooked album is neurotica by redd kross about which jonathan poneman said neurotica was a life changer for me and for a lot of people in the seattle music community169 1985–1989 early development sub pops bruce pavitt with a sonic youth poster in 1985 the band green river released their debut ep come on down which is cited by many as being the very first grunge record170 another seminal release in the development of grunge was the deep six compilation released by cz records in 1986 the record featured multiple tracks by six bands green river soundgarden melvins malfunkshun skin yard and the umen for many of them it was their first appearance on record the artists had a mostly heavy aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with the intensity of hardcore the recording process was lowbudget each band was given four hours of studio time as jack endino recalled people just said well what kind of music is this this isnt metal its not punk what is it people went eureka these bands all have something in common163 later that year bruce pavitt released the sub pop 100 compilation and green rivers dry as a bone ep as part of his new label sub pop an early sub pop catalog described the green river ep as ultraloose grunge that destroyed the morals of a generation171 sub pops bruce pavitt and jonathan poneman inspired by other regional music scenes in music history worked to ensure that their label projected a seattle sound reinforced by a similar style of production and album packaging while music writer michael azerrad acknowledged that early grunge bands like mudhoney soundgarden and tad had disparate sounds he noted to the objective observer there were some distinct similarities172 dave grohl playing drums in 1989 early grunge concerts were sparsely attended many by fewer than a dozen people but sub pop photographer charles petersons pictures helped create the impression that such concerts were major events173 mudhoney which was formed by former members of green river served as the flagship band of sub pop during their entire time with the label and spearheaded the seattle grunge movement174 other record labels in the pacific northwest that helped promote grunge included cz records estrus records empty records and popllama records29 courtney love performing with her band hole in 1989 grunge attracted media attention in the united kingdom after pavitt and poneman asked journalist everett true from the british magazine melody maker to write an article on the local music scene this exposure helped to make grunge known outside of the local area during the late 1980s and drew more people to local shows29 the appeal of grunge to the music press was that it promised the return to a notion of a regional authorial vision for american rock175 grunges popularity in the underground music scene was such that bands began to move to seattle and approximate the look and sound of the original grunge bands mudhoneys steve turner said it was really bad pretend bands were popping up here things werent coming from where we were coming from176 as a reaction many grunge bands diversified their sound with nirvana and tad in particular creating more melodic songs177 dawn anderson of the seattle fanzine backlash recalled that by 1990 many locals had tired of the hype surrounding the seattle scene and hoped that media exposure had dissipated29 chris dubrow from the guardian states that in the late 1980s australias stickyflooredalternative pub scene in seedy innercity areas produced grunge bands with raw and awkward energy such as the scientists x beasts of bourbon feedtime cosmic psychos and lubricated goat178 dubrow said cobainadmitted the australian wave was a big influence on his music178 everett true states that theres more of an argument to be had for grunge beginning in australia with the scientists and their scrawny punk ilk6 1989–1993 mainstream success nirvana performing at the 1992 mtv video music awards grunge bands had made inroads to the musical mainstream in the late 1980s soundgarden was the first grunge band to sign to a major label when they joined the roster of am records in 1989 soundgarden along with other major label signings alice in chains and screaming trees performed okay with their initial major label releases according to jack endino29 alice in chains debut album facelift spawned a hit single with man in the box which according to steve huey mtv jumped all over the video for man in the box giving the group a crucial boost and helping to pave the way for grunges popular explosion toward the end of 1991179 nirvana originally from aberdeen washington was also courted by major labels while releasing its first album bleach in 1989 nirvana got signed by geffen records in 1990 in september 1991 nirvana released its major label debut nevermind the album was at best hoped to be a minor success on par with sonic youths goo which geffen had released a year earlier180 it was the release of the albums first single smells like teen spirit that marked the instigation of the grunge music phenomenon due to constant airplay of the songs music video on mtv nevermind was selling 400000 copies a week by christmas 1991181 in january 1992 nevermind replaced pop superstar michael jacksons dangerous at number one on the billboard 200182 nevermind was certified diamond by the recording industry association of america riaa in 1999183 the success of nevermind surprised the music industry nevermind not only popularized grunge but also established the cultural and commercial viability of alternative rock in general184 michael azerrad asserted that nevermind symbolized a seachange in rock music in which the glam metal that had dominated rock music at that time fell out of favor in the face of music that was perceived as authentic and culturally relevant185 grunge made it possible for genres thought to be of a niche audience no matter how radical to prove their marketability and be coopted by the mainstream cementing the formation of an individualist fragmented culture186 other grunge bands subsequently replicated nirvanas success pearl jam which featured former mother love bone members jeff ament and stone gossard had released its debut album ten in august 1991 a month before nevermind but album sales only picked up a year later by the second half of 1992 ten had become a breakthrough success being certified gold and reaching number two on the billboard charts187 ten by pearl jam was certified 13x platinum by the riaa188 soundgardens album badmotorfinger and alice in chains dirt along with temple of the dog a collaboration featuring members of pearl jam and soundgarden were also among the 100 top selling albums of 1992189 the popular breakthrough of these grunge bands prompted rolling stone to nickname seattle the new liverpool81 major record labels signed most of the prominent grunge bands in seattle while a second influx of bands moved to the city in hopes of success190 the grunge scene was the backdrop in the 1992 cameron crowe film singles there were several small roles performances and cameos in the film by popular seattle grunge bands including pearl jam soundgarden and alice in chains filmed in and around seattle in 1991 the film was not released until 1992 during the height of grunge popularity81 layne staley lead vocalist for grunge band alice in chains performing in concert in 1992 the popularity of grunge resulted in a large interest in the seattle music scenes perceived cultural traits while the seattle music scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s in actuality consisted of various styles and genres of music its representation in the media served to depict seattle as a music community in which the focus was upon the ongoing exploration of one musical idiom namely grunge191 the fashion industry marketed grunge fashion to consumers charging premium prices for items such as knit ski hats and plaid shirts critics asserted that advertising was coopting elements of grunge and turning it into a fad entertainment weekly commented in a 1993 article there hasnt been this kind of exploitation of a subculture since the media discovered hippies in the 60s192 marketers used the grunge concept to sell grunge air freshener grunge hair gel and even cds of easylistening music called grunge light25 the new york times compared the grunging of america to the massmarketing of punk rock disco and hip hop in previous years81 ironically the new york times was tricked into printing a fake list of slang terms that were supposedly used in the grunge scene often referred to as the grunge speak hoax this media hype surrounding grunge was documented in the 1996 documentary hype29 as mass media began to use the term grunge in any news story about the key bands seattle scene members began to refer to the term as the gword25 a backlash against grunge began to develop in seattle in late 1992 jonathan poneman said that in the city all things grunge are treated with the utmost cynicism and amusement because the whole thing is a fabricated movement and always has been81 many grunge artists were uncomfortable with their success and the resulting attention it brought nirvanas kurt cobain told michael azerrad famous is the last thing i wanted to be193 pearl jam also felt the burden of success with much of the attention falling on frontman eddie vedder194 grunge band pearl jam in columbia maryland on september 4 2000 nirvanas followup album in utero 1993 featured an intentionally abrasive album that nirvana bassist krist novoselic described as a wild aggressive sound a true alternative record195 nevertheless upon its release in september 1993 in utero topped the billboard charts196 in 1996 in utero was certified 5x platinum by the riaa197 pearl jam also continued to perform well commercially with its second album vs 1993 the album sold a record 950378 copies in its first week of release topped the billboard charts and outperformed all other entries in the top ten that week combined198 in 1993 the grunge band candlebox released their selftitled album which was certified 4x platinum by the riaa199 in february 1994 alice in chains ep jar of flies peaked at number 1 on the billboard 200

panned by critics who accused them of being bandwagonjumpers stone temple pilots in particular fell victim to this in a january 1994 rolling stone poll stone temple pilots was simultaneously voted best new band by rolling stones readers and worst new band by the magazines music critics highlighting the disparity between critics and fans211 stone temple pilots became very popular their album core was certified 8x platinum by riaa212 and their album purple was certified 6x platinum by the riaa213 the british band bush released their debut album sixteen stone in 1994214 in a review of their second album razorblade suitcase rolling stone criticized the album and called bush the most successful and shameless mimics of nirvanas music215 in the book fargo rock city a heavy metal odyssey in rural north dakota chuck klosterman wrote bush was a good band who just happened to signal the beginning of the end ultimately they would become the grunge warrant216 in the book accidental revolution the story of grunge kyle anderson wrote the twelve songs on sixteen stone sound exactly like what grunge is supposed to sound like while the whole point of grunge was that it didnt really sound like anything including itself just consider how many different bands and styles of music have been shoved under the grunge header in this discography alone and you realize that grunge is probably the most illdefined genre of music in history217 1993–1997 decline of mainstream popularity end of subculture a memorial to nirvana singer kurt cobain in his hometown of aberdeen washington erected soon after his death a number of factors contributed to grunges decline in prominence critics and historians do not agree on the exact point that grunge ended218 catherine strong states that at the end of 1993grunge had become unstable and was entering the first stages of being killed off she points out that the scene had become so successful and widely known that imitators had begun to enter the field219 paste magazine states by 1994 grunge was fading fast with pearl jam retreating from the spotlight as fast as they could alice in chains stone temple pilots and hordes of others were battling horrid drug addictions and struggling for survival3 in grunge seattle justin henderson states that the downward spiral began in mid1994 as the influx of major label money into the scene changed the culture and it had nowhere to go but down he states the death of hole bassist kristen pfaff on june 16 1994 from a heroin overdose was another nail in grunges coffin 220 in jason hellers 2013 article did grunge really matter in av club he stated that nirvanas in utero september 1993 was grunge’s death knell as soon as cobain grumbled “teenage angst has paid off well now i’m bored and old” it was all over221 heller states that after cobains death in 1994 the hypocrisy in the grunge of the time became glaring and idealism became embarrassing with the result being that grunge became the new mainstream aerosmith221 heller states that grunge became an evolutionary dead end because it stood for nothing and was built on nothing and that ethos of negation was all it was about221 during the mid1990s many grunge bands broke up or became less visible kurt cobain labeled by time as the john lennon of the swinging northwest appeared unusually tortured by success and struggled with an addiction to heroin rumors surfaced in early 1994 that cobain suffered a drug overdose and that nirvana was breaking up222 on april 8 1994 cobain was found dead in his seattle home from an apparently selfinflicted gunshot wound nirvana summarily disbanded cobains suicide served as a catalyst for grunge’sdemise because it deflated the energy from grunge and provided the opening for saccharine and corporateformulated music to regain its lost footing223 that same year pearl jam canceled its summer tour in protest of what it regarded as ticket vendor ticketmasters unfair business practices224 pearl jam then began a boycott of the company however pearl jams initiative to play only at nonticketmaster venues effectively with a few exceptions prevented the band from playing shows in the united states for the next three years225 in 1996 alice in chains gave their final performances with their ailing and estranged lead singer layne staley226 who subsequently died from an overdose of cocaine and heroin in 2002227 in 1996 soundgarden and screaming trees released their final studio albums of the 1990s down on the upside228 and dust229 respectively strong states that roy shuker and stout have written that the end of grunge can be seen as being as late as the breakup of soundgarden in 1997219 postgrunge main article postgrunge british band bush were described by matt diehl of rolling stone as the most successful and shameless mimics of nirvanas music during the latter half of the 1990s grunge was supplanted by postgrunge which remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century postgrunge transformed the thick guitar sounds and candid lyrical themes of the seattle bands into an accessible often uplifting mainstream aesthetic230 these artists were seen as lacking the underground roots of grunge and were largely influenced by what grunge had become namely a wildly popular form of inwardlooking seriousminded hard rock postgrunge was a more commercially viable genre that tempered the distorted guitars of grunge with polished radioready production231232 when grunge became a mainstream genre major labels started signing bands that sounded similar to these bands sonic identities bands labeled as postgrunge that emerged when grunge was mainstream such as bush candlebox and collective soul all are noted for emulating the sound of the bands that launched grunge into the mainstream231 although the bands bush233234235 and candlebox236 have been categorized as grunge both bands have been largely categorized as postgrunge too231 in 1995 spin writer charles aaron stated that with grunge spent pop punk in a slump britpop a giddy memory and albumoriented rock over the music industry turned to corporateproduced alternative which he calls soundalike fake grunge or scrunge237 bands aaron lists as scrunge groups include better than ezra bush collective soul garbage hootie the blowfish hum silverchair sponge tripping daisy jennifer trynin and weezer aaron includes the foo fighters in his list but states that dave grohl avoided becoming a scrunge fall guy by combining 1980s hardcore punk with 1970s arena trash music in his postnirvana group237 bands like bush233234235 and candlebox236 have been largely categorized as postgrunge 232 these two bands became popular after 1992232 tim grierson of aboutcom described bands such as bush and candlebox writing perhaps not surprisingly because these bands seemed to be merely ripping off a trendy sound critics dismissed them as bandwagonjumpers tellingly these bands were labeled almost pejoratively as “postgrunge” suggesting that rather than being a musical movement in their own right they were just a calculated cynical response to a legitimate stylistic shift in rock music231 postgrunge band creed in 2002 other bands categorized as postgrunge that emerged when bush and candlebox became popular include collective soul231 and live238 postgrunge still was popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s with newer bands such as creed nickelback 3 doors down and puddle of mudd231 other postgrunge bands include foo fighters staind and matchbox twenty these postgrunge artists were criticized for their commercialized sound as well as their worldview built around the comforts of community and romantic relationships as opposed to grunges lyrical exploration of troubling issues such as suicide societal hypocrisy and drug addiction231 adam steininger criticized postgrunge bands diluted ditties filled with watereddown lyrics all seemingly revolving around suffering through romance239 steininger criticized candlebox for their popfilled sound focus on love lyrics and writing songs without versatility and creativity three days grace for their diluted and radiofriendly music 3 doors down for focusing on snagging hit singles instead of creating quality albums finger eleven for going in a pop rock direction bushs random phrasings of nonsense lives pseudo pop poetry that strangled the essence of grunge puddle of mudds watered down postgrunge sound lifehouse for tearing down grunges sound and groundbreaking structure to appeal more to the masses and nickelback which he calls the featherweightpunching bags of postgrunge whose music is dull as dishwater239 reaction by britpop main article britpop leading britpop band oasis playing live conversely another rock genre britpop emerged in part as a reaction against the dominance of grunge in the united kingdom in contrast to the dourness of grunge britpop was defined by youthful exuberance and desire for recognition240 the leading britpop bands blur and oasis existed as reactionary forces to grunges eternal downcast glare241 britpop artists new approach was inspired by blurs tour of the united states in the spring of 1992 justine frischmann formerly of suede and leader of elastica and at the time in a relationship with damon albarn explained damon and i felt like we were in the thick of it at that point it occurred to us that nirvana were out there and people were very interested in american music and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of britishness242 britpop artists were vocal about their disdain for grunge in a 1993 nme interview damon albarn of britpop band blur agreed with interviewer john harris assertion that blur was an antigrunge band and said well thats good if punk was about getting rid of hippies then im getting rid of grunge243 noel gallagher of oasis while a fan of nirvana wrote music that refuted the pessimistic nature of grunge gallagher noted in 2006 that the 1994 oasis single live forever was written in the middle of grunge and all that and i remember nirvana had a tune called i hate myself and i want to die and i was likewell im not fucking having that as much as i fucking like him cobain and all that shit im not having that i cant have people like that coming over here on smack heroin fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die thats fucking rubbish244 2000s–2010s revival pearl jams addition of piano player and keyboardist boom gaspar in 2002 would have been unthinkable in the bands early guitars only days his inclusion in the band shows how major grunge bands sound changed over the years many major grunge bands have continued recording and touring with success in the 2000s and 2010s perhaps the most notable grunge act of the 21st century has been pearl jam in 2006 rolling stone writer brian hiatt described pearl jam as having spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame he noted the band developed a loyal concert following akin to that of the grateful dead245 they saw a return to wide commercial success with 2006s pearl jam 2009s backspacer and 2013s lightning bolt246 despite kurt cobains death the remaining members of nirvana have continued to be successful posthumously due to the high sales for kurt cobains journals and the bands bestof compilation nirvana upon their releases in 2002 the new york times argued nirvana are having more success now than at any point since mr cobains suicide in 1994247 this trend has continued through the centurys second decade with the reissuing of the bands discography and release of the authorized documentary kurt cobain montage of heck248 alice in chains reformed for a handful of reunion dates in 2005 with several different vocalists replacing layne staley eventually settling on william duvall as staleys replacement in 2009 they released black gives way to blue their first record in 15 years the bands 2013 release the devil put dinosaurs here reached number 2 on the billboard 200249 soundgarden reformed in 2010 and released their album king animal two years later which reached the top five of the national albums charts in denmark new zealand and the united states250 matt cameron and ben shepherd joined alain johannes queens of the stone age eleven mark lanegan screaming trees queens of the stone age and dimitri coats off to form side project ten commandos in 2016251 one of the most successful rock groups of the 21st century queens of the stone age has featured major contributions from various grunge musicians josh homme had briefly played in screaming trees with offandon qotsa member mark lanegan before forming the group nirvanas dave grohl and elevens alain johannes have also provided notable contributions homme and grohl joined with led zeppelins john paul jones to form the supergroup them crooked vultures in 2009 johannes also performed with the group as a touring member australian singersongwriter and guitarist courtney barnett in 2015 in the early 2000s grunge would make multiple regionally based resurgences albeit slight ones in 2005 the seattle times made note of grungeinfluenced groups returning in the seattle scene252 similarly the guardian reported of grungeinfluenced groups from yorkshire including dinosaur pileup pulled apart by horses and wonderswan253 also in 2003 the new york times noted a resurgence in grunge fashion254 the 2010s have birthed a number bands influenced by grunge unlike their forebears some of these acts ascribe the label to themselves willingly many acts have been noted for affiliating andor collaborating with prominent figures from the original alternative rock era steve albini has produced for or worked with members of bands such as bully255256 vomitface257258258 and shannon wright259 while emma ruth rundle of marriages260 has toured with buzz osbourne of the melvins other acts that have been labelled as grunge or as heavily influenced by the grunge era include courtney barnett261262 wolf alice263 yuck264 speedy ortiz265 mitski266 254267 false advertising268 slothrust269270271 ramonda hammer272 the ghost ease273 baby in vain274 big thief275 dilly dally276 kagoule277 and torres278 legacy alice in chains bassist mike inez at a 2010 concert in 2011 music critic dave whitaker wrote that each generation from the start of recorded music has introduced a gamechanging genre from swing music in the 1930s rock and roll in the 1950s punk rock in the 1970s and then grunge in the 1990s however he states grunge was the last american musical revolution as no postgrunge generation has introduced a new genre which radically changed the music scene93 he states that the digital revolution online music file sharing etc has meant that there has not been a generationdefining genre since grunge because for one genre to so completely saturate the market requires a music industry with immense control over the market93 in 2016 rob zombie stated that grunge caused the death of the rock star he states that unlike previous stars like alice cooper and gene simmons and elton john who might as well have been from another fuckin’ planet with grunge the attitude was we need all our rock stars to look just like us279 bob batchelor states that the indie record mindset and values in seattle which provided guidance for the development and emergence of nirvana and pearl jam conflicted with the major recording label desire to sell millions of cds batchelor also states that despite grunge musicians discomfort with the major labels commercial goals and the resistance by some key bands to do the promotional activities required by the labels including music videos mtvs video programs played an instrumental role in making grunge become mainstream since many music fans received their first exposure on mtv rather than on local or niche radio223 gil troy states that the grunge rebellion like most others in americas consumerist culture ended up being commodified massproduced ritualized and thus sanitized by major corporations280 this photo of a mudhoney concert captures some of the bands live show energy in 2011 john calvert stated that timing is the reason why a grunge revival did not happen he says that the cultural mood of the late 1980s and early 1990s which inspired the movement were no longer present15 seattle songwriter jeff stetson states that people from the 2010s who are listening to grunge should learn about the context and history of how it all came to be and respect for what a truly amazing thing it was that happened here in seattle because you probably wont see anything like it again22 paste magazines michael danaher states that the grunge movement changed the course of rock ’n’ roll bringing tales of abuse and depression and socially conscious issues into pop culture3 this photo of a 2000sera alice in chains show in which the band was accompanied by an orchestra shows how groups sound can change over the years calvert stated that nirvanas smells like teen spirit has an iconic place in history as it had generationdefining resonance for young people from its era he states that no other bandmade the urge to selfdestructas listenable with authentic pain and disaffection15 calvert also calls the record chart historys most ferocious dark and intense music since early punk rock and he says it was heavy when heavy was needed by young people of that era jarring young america awake and giving them something to cling to in difficult times15 a 2017 book stated that grunge forever changed the identity of rock music in a way analogous to punk moreover grunge added introspective lyrics about existential authenticity and what it means to be true to oneself4 grunges kurt cobain has been called the voice of generation x playing the same role for this demographic as bob dylan played for 1960s youth and that john lennon played for the 1970s generation4 bob batchelor states that nirvana was as important as elvis or the beatles”223 in 2008 darragh mcmanus of the guardian states that grunge was not simply a young persons trend or a musical fad she states that grunge synthesized the key philosophies of the modern era from feminism liberalism irony apathy cynicismidealism antiauthoritarianism to wry postmodernism mcmanus states that grunge dealt with serious weighty topics which does not occur often in popular music mcmanus stated that for generation x grunge was not just music it was a key cultural influence281 marlen komar states that nirvanas success popularized nonheterosexist nonbinary ways of thinking about gender and sexuality emphasized how men and women were alike and promoted progressive political thinking104 role of women while most rock genres do not have prominent women instrumentalists several major grunge bands had female musicians pictured is drummer patty schemel from hole while there is a perception that grunge bands were overwhelmingly male women were totally represented in grunge bands such as l7 lunachicks dickless 7 year bitch the gits courtney loves band hole and loves other 1990s groups and babes in toyland the latter an allfemale minneapolis band and grunge was closely linked with riot grrrl an underground feminist punk movement282 vh1 writer dan tucker stated that l7 was an allfemale grunge band that emanated from the fertile la underground scene and which had strong ties withblack flag and could match any male band in attitude and volume27 riot grrrl pioneer and bikini kill frontwoman kathleen hanna riot grrrl pioneer and bikini kill frontwomanbassist kathleen hanna was closely associated with the washington state grunge scene hanna came up with the name for nirvanas 1991 breakthrough single smells like teen spirit a reference to a deodorant marketed specifically to young women283284 notable women instrumentalists include the bassists darcy wretzky and melissa auf der maur from the smashing pumpkins and drummers patty schemel hole and courtney love projects and lori barbero of babes in toyland63 the inclusion of women instrumentalists in grunge is notable because professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in most rock genres285 as well women played an active role in the underground grunge scene such as riot grrrls who produced zines about grunge bands and indie record labels eg grunge gerl 1 and seattle scene leader dawn anderson who wrote for the seattle fanzine backlash29 tina casale was the cofounder of cz records in the 1980s along with chris hanzsek an indie label that recorded what
