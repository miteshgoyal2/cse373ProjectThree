statistics as of 1 july 2012 1200 singles have topped the uk singles chart7 the precise number of charttoppers is debatable due to the profusion of competing charts from the 1950s to the 1980s but the usual list used is that endorsed by the guinness book of british hit singles and subsequently adopted by the official charts company the company regards a selected period of the new musical express chart only from 1952 to 1960 and the record retailer chart from 1960 to 1969 as predecessors for the period prior to 11 february 1969 where multiples of competing charts none official coexisted side by side for example the bbc compiled its own chart based on an average of the music papers of the time many songs announced as having reached number one on bbc radio and top of the pops prior to 1969 are not listed as charttoppers according to the legacy criteria of the charts company the first number one on the uk singles chart was here in my heart by al martino for the week ending date 14

the compilation of sales of records the music market measured a songs popularity by sales of sheet music the idea of compiling a chart based on sales originated in the united states where the musictrade paper billboard compiled the first chart incorporating sales figures on 20 july 1940 record charts in the uk began in 1952 when percy dickins of the new musical express nme gathered a pool of 52 stores willing to report sales figures89 for the first british chart dickins telephoned approximately 20 shops asking for a list of the 10 bestselling songs these results were then aggregated into a top 12 chartnb 1 published in nme on 14 november 1952 with al martinos here in my heart awarded the numberone position89 the chart became a successful feature of the periodical it expanded into a top 20 format on 1 october 1954 and rival publications began compiling their own charts in 195512 record mirror compiled its own top 10 chart for 22 january 1955 it was based on postal returns from record stores which were financed by the newspaper the nme chart was based on a telephone poll13 both charts expanded in size with mirrors becoming a top 20 in october 1955 and nmes becoming a top 30 in april 19561214 another rival publication melody maker began compiling its own chart it telephoned 19 stores to produce a top 20 for 7 april 1956 it was also the first chart to include northern ireland in its sample9 record mirror began running a top 5 album chart in july 1956 from november 1958 onwards it was run by nme1512 in march 1960 record retailer began compiling an ep album chart and had a top 50 singles chart15 although nme had the largest circulation of charts in the 1960s and was widely followed916 in march 1962 record mirror stopped compiling its own chart and published record retailers instead9 retailer began independent auditing in january 1963 and has been used by the uk singles chart as the source for numberones since the week ending 12 march 19601215 the choice of record retailer as the source has been criticised179 however the chart was unique in listing close to 50 positions for the whole decade17 with available lists of which record shops were sampled to compile the charts some shops were subjected to hyping but with record retailer being less widely followed than some charts it was subject to less hyping additionally retailer was set up by independent record shops and had no funding or affiliation with record companies however it had a significantly smaller sample size than some rival charts9 before february 1969 when the british market research bureau bmrb chart was established there was no official chart or universally accepted source91617 readers followed the charts in various periodicals and during this time the bbc used aggregated results of charts from the nme melody maker disc and later record mirror to compile the pick of the pops chart13 the official charts company and guinness british hit singles albums use as sources for the unofficial period the nme before 10 march 1960 and record retailer until 196912 however until 1969 the record retailer chart was only seen by people working in the industry the most widely circulated chart was the nme one as used by radio luxembourgs legendary sunday night top 20 show as well as by abc tvs thank your lucky stars which had an audience of up to 6 million on itv official chartedit before 1969 there was no official singles chart91617 record retailer and the bbc commissioned the british market research bureau bmrb to compile charts beginning 15 february 1969912 the bmrb compiled its first chart from postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops12 the sampling cost approximately £52000 shops were randomly chosen from a pool of approximately 6000 and submitted figures for sales taken up to the close of trade on saturday the sales diaries were translated into punch cards so the data could be interpreted by a computer a computer then compiled the chart on monday and the bbc were informed of the top 50 on tuesday in time for it to be announced on johnnie walkers afternoon show the charts were also published in record retailer rebranded record tape retailer in 1971 and music week in 197218 and record mirror9 however the bmrb often struggled to have the full sample of sales figures returned by post the 1971 postal strike meant data had to be collected by telephone but this was deemed inadequate for a national chart by 1973 the bmrb was using motorcycle couriers to collect sales figures9 in may 1978 the singles chart was expanded from a top 50 to a top 75 a world in action documentary exposé in 1980 revealed corruption within the industry stores chartreturns dealers would frequently be offered bribes to falsify sales logs19 electronicage chartsedit from 1983 to 1990 the chart was financed by bpi 50 percent music week 38 percent and the bbc 12 percent20 on 4 january 1983 the chart compilation was assumed by the gallup organization which expanded the chart with a next 25 in addition to the top 75nb 2 and began the introduction of computerised compilers automating the datacollection process912 in july 1987 gallup signed a new agreement with bpi increasing the sample size to approximately 500 stores and introducing barcode scanners to read data22 the chart was based entirely on sales of vinyl single records from retail outlets and announced on tuesday until october 1987 when the top 40 was revealed each sunday due to the new automated process23 the 1980s also saw the introduction of the cassette single or cassingle alongside the 7inch and 12inch record formats in 1987 major record labels developed a common format for the compact disc single24 in may 1989 chart regulations kept kylie minogues song hand on your heart from entering at number one because sales from cassette singles were not included they were sold for £199 – cheaper than allowed at the time following this the british phonographic industry bpi reduced the minimum price for cassette singles to influence sales figures25 in september 1989 w h smith began to send sales data to gallup directly through electronic point of sale epos terminals22 in january 1990 the bpi gave notice to gallup bbc and music week on 30 june 1990 it terminated its contract with them because it could no longer afford the £600000 a year cost2627 from 1 july 1990 the chart information network cin was formed by spotlight publicationsnb 3 publisher of music week in cooperation with the bbc and the british association of record dealers bard – representing retailers including w h smith woolworths hmv and virgin – who agreed to exclusively supply sales data to the cin2229 a chart supervisory committee csc represented the bbc cin and retailers the bpi were reluctant to join and considered the option of launching a rival chart27 but in september an agreement was reached and it joined the csc30 for this period the chart was produced by gallup and owned by cin and music week who would then sell it to the bbc and bpi31 in january 1991 the cin became a joint venture between link house magazines formerly spotlight publications later miller freeman inc32 and the bpi they shared the revenue and costs reportedly between £750000 and £1 million223133 during this time other retailers such as woolworths and john menzies began submitting data using epos terminals22 in late 1991 the sample consisted of 500 stores scanning barcodes of all record sales into an epson px4 computer and 650 other stores providing sales data through their own epos computerised tills these computers were to be telephoned six times a week providing the data to gallup34 in june 1991 the bpi reduced the number of eligible formats from five to four35 in november 1990 the next 25 section of the uk singles chart positions 76–100 with special rules ceased to be printed in the trade magazine music weekcitation needed in april 1991 record mirror ceased publication along with the next 25183637 virgin installed jda epos terminals in september 1993 and began providing sales data to gallup38 in february 1993 the research contract for the chart was put out to tender with a new fouryear contract beginning 1 february 1994 offered millward brown research international and nielsen market research were approached and gallup were invited to reapply39 in may it was announced that millward brown had been accepted as the next chart compilers signing a £1millionayear contract22 millward brown took over compiling the charts on 1 february 1994 increasing the sample size1240 by the end of the month each shop sampled used a barcode scanner linking via an epson terminal with a modem to a central computer called eric which logged data from more than 2500 stores40 gallup attempted to block millward browns new chart by complaining to the office of fair trading about the contractual clause in which bard retailers exclusively supplied sales data to the cin but the interim order was rejected41 in june 1995 the case was dropped after the clause allowing bard retailers to supply sales information to other chart compilers was deleted because cin retained the copyright other compilers could not use or sell the information42 on 2 april 1995 the number of eligible formats was reduced from four to three35 the decision came after nine months of negotiations with bard which objected that it would adversely affect the vinyl record industry43 although record labels were not prohibited from releasing singles in more than three formats they were required to identify the three eligible formats35 this resulted in a reduction in the number of singles released in 7inch format the most common three formats were 12inch single cassette and cd or a cassette and two cd versions44 the ruling resulted in the oasis single some might say charting twice in one week – at number 1 with sales from the three eligible formats and at number 71 from sales in a fourth 12inch format45 subsequently cin sought to develop new marketing opportunities and sponsorship deals these included premiumrate fax and telephone services and the chart newsletters chartsplus

minimum dealer price to £17948 on 1 july 1998 bard and bpi took over management of the chart from the cin a miller freeman and bpi venture with new company music industry chart services mics49 however in august they decided to return to compiling the charts under the name cin50 in 1999 millward brown began rechipping some retailers machines in anticipation of the millennium bug51 however some independent retailers lost access to the recordlabelfunded electronic record ordering system eros it was too costly to make it year 2000 compliant52 towards the end of the 1990s companies anticipated

january 2004 mycokemusic launched as the first significant download retailer54 legal downloading was initially small with mycokemusic selling over 100000 downloads during its first three months in june the itunes store was launched in the uk and more than 450000 songs were downloaded during the first week55 in early september the uk official download chart was launched and a new live recording of westlifes flying without wings was the first numberone56 in 2005 wes butters presented his final uk top 40 show concluding his tenure at radio 1 the chart show was then rebranded for the chart week ending 16 april and the first singles chart combining physicalrelease sales with legal downloads began several test charts and a downloadsales chart were published in 2004 this combination within the official singles chart reflected a changing era in which sales of physical singles fell and download sales rose on 17 april 2005 hosts jk and joel commented during their bbc radio 1 broadcast that the incorporation of download sales resulted in an approximate doubling of singles sales for the week for the first weeks combined chart the impact of this doubling was not readily apparent at the top of the chart although a few singles in the middle positions benefited initially the british association of record dealers was concerned that the popularity of downloading would siphon business from the high streetcitation needed it also complained that including singles not available physically would confuse customers and create gaps in stores sale racks however it agreed to the new rules provided that digital sales were only included to a singles sales tally if there was a physical equivalent sold in shops at the time since there was no rule governing a minimum number of pressings gorillaz released only 300 vinyl copies of their single feel good inc on 12 april 2005 a month before its general release this allowed it to debut in the chart at number 22 eventually reaching number 2 and remain in the top 40 for a longer period after pressure from elsewhere in the music industry a second compromise was reached in 2006 which now allowed singles to chart on downloads the week before their physical release the first song to make the top 40 on downloads alone was pump it by the black eyed peas which charted at number 16 on 12 march 2006 three weeks later crazy by gnarls barkley became the first song to top the charts on download sales alone as part of the revised rules singles would now be removed from the chart two weeks after the deletion of their physical formats crazy left the chart 11 weeks later from number 5 and a subsequent charttopper nelly furtados maneater disappeared from number 10 this was in addition to the existing rule that to be eligible for the chart the physical single had to have been released within the last twelve months supporting the general view that the chart reflected the topselling current releases over the coming months digital sales continued to increase whilst physical sales continued to fall more artists entered the top 40 early and fewer singles entered the chart directly at number 1 whilst initially the proportion of digital sales to physical sales in the combined tally was relatively low a majority of singles by 2012 saw more than 50 percent of their sales coming from online sales through mobile phones are also countedcitation needed on 1 january 2007 the integration of downloaded music into the charts became complete when all downloads – with or without a physical equivalent – became eligible to chart redefining the uk singles chart by turning it into a songs chart this saw a few singles gain publicity crazy and maneater still selling strongly on downloads some time after their physical equivalents had been withdrawn returned to the chart with several others which had been removed in the preceding months chasing cars by snow patrol returned at a top 10 position number 9 just three places below the peak it had reached the previous september while honey to the bee by billie piper following a tongueincheek promotional push by radio 1 dj chris moyles to test the new chart rules reappeared at number 17 nearly eight years after its original appearance on the charts the second song to return to the top 40 several years after its first hit run was ill be missing you by puff daddy and faith evans which reappeared at number 32 a decade after it originally topped the chart the impetus this time was puff daddys recent performance of a new version of the track at the concert for diana at wembley stadium two months later luciano pavarottis nessun dorma returned to the chart at number 24 during the week following his death 17 years after it was first a hit climbing to number 12 a drumming gorilla in a dairy milk television advertisement helped in the air tonight by phil collins to climb to number 14 26 years after it was first a hit and 19 years since its last chart appearance as a remix none of these songs had been officially reissued blag steal and borrow by koopa became the first song to chart without being released physically and the first by an unsigned band to do so later they would do it again twice with one off song for the summer and the crash reaching no 21 and no 16 respectively while the band remained unsigned until the following year following the cancellation of its physical release say it right by nelly furtado was the first top 10 hit to pass through its chart career without a single copy appearing in a shop lord dont slow me down by oasis became the second violet hill by coldplay the third and disturbia by rihanna the fourth candyman by christina aguilera had a chart run that took it into the top 20 number 17 entirely on downloads the first numberone hit never released physically was run by leona lewis the 11th song in total to reach number one on downloads alone unlike the previous 10 it did not receive a physical release in subsequent weeks although it was released physically overseas notably in germany the second occurrence was on 20 december 2009 when killing in the name by rage against the machine became the first song that was not a new release to reach no 1 on downloads alone this was the result of a facebook campaign urging people to download the song in a bid to prevent the x factor winning song from becoming the christmas no 1 single again after four consecutive years the song originally peaked at no 25 in 1992 new rules were added to the chart on 16 september 2007 to include onetrack cd singles with a limit of 15 minutes and to retail at a minimum of 40p per onetrack cd single a notable effect of the new chart rules is to demonstrate the enduring appeal of many downloads especially if a physical copy is no longer or never has been available despite a sevenweek gap in its chart run in late 2006 while ineligible under the old rules snow patrols chasing cars clocked 108 weeks on the chart a record bettered by only one single in chart history my way by frank sinatra with 124 weeks numerous other hits are on for more than 40 weeks jeff buckleys 1994 cover of leonard cohens hallelujah charted at number 2 on 21 december 2008 on downloads alone following the formation of a 110000strong protest group on facebook to get it above winner of the x factor 2008 alexandra burkes version for the christmas number one another consequence of the chart rules that was expected but has not materialised is that in the event of a new album release by a wellknown artist all or most of its tracks could appear on the singles chart due to buyers downloading individual songs rather than the complete album there was no significant example of this until early october 2007 with the cast of high school musical 2 placing six of its songs in the top 75 although these were credited to their individual performers and a further four just outside a month later leona lewis placed five tracks from her album spirit simultaneously on the singles chart another example was anticipated with the arrival of the beatles catalogue online with forecasters predicting the entire top 10 being taken up by beatles songs5758 this chart domination never occurred only four beatles songs reentered the top 75 the highestplaced being let it be at number 38 yet another effect of the new rules was the reappearance in the chart of a number of seasonal favourites during christmas 2007 a total of 19 achieved this without being officially reissued on downloads alone two of these by mariah carey and the pogues reached the top 5 eleven christmas hits returned to the top 75 for christmas 2008 nine in 2009 eight in 2010 and twelve in 2011 with the mariah carey and pogues songs faring best each year the first unsigned artist to break the top 5 was alex day who reached number 4 with his single forever yours in the christmas chart beating coldplay and olly murs59 following a largescale social media campaign in february 2013 unsigned artists macklemore and ryan lewis topped the chart with thrift shop60 the death of michael jackson on 25 june 2009 triggered a surge in sales of his recordings this was the first time in the download era that the effect of a major stars death on the chart could be observed during the week beginning 28 june a total of 16 of his solo hits plus 4 more by the jackson 5 reentered the chart the following week the momentum continued 27 jackson titles charted in the top 75 21 solo one with his sister janet and five by the jacksons with man in the mirror charting the highest at number 2 the second chart invasion of the download era resulting from the death of a major artist was observed in late july 2011 following the death of amy winehouse with seven former singles charting and one other song appearing for the first time it was announced in june 2014 that as of sunday 29 june audio streams from services such as spotify deezer napster o2 tracks xbox music sony unlimited and rara would be counted towards the official singles chart in order to reflect changing music consumption in the united kingdom61 the final number one on the uk singles chart to be based on sales alone was gecko overdrive by oliver heldens featuring becky hill62 on sunday 6 july 2014 the official charts company announced that ariana grande had earned a place in uk chart history when her single problem featuring iggy azalea becoming the first numberone single based on sales and streaming data63 on 7 december 2014 ed sheerans thinking out loud became the first single to reach

overall lead of 13000 chart sales64 on 10 march 2017 ed sheeran claimed 9 of the top 10 positions in the chart when his album ÷ was released65 the large number of tracks from the album on the singles
