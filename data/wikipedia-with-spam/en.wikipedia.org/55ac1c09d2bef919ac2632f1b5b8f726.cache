scoring with mannings 50yard touchdown pass to tight end dallas clark the steelers were forced to punt on their ensuing drive but only after taking over seven minutes off the clock leaving just 603 left in the game by the time indianapolis got the ball back one play after the punt an interception by pittsburgh safety troy polamalu was overturned by instant replay a reversal that the league would later admit was a mistake5 taking advantage of his second chance manning completed a 9yard pass to clark a 20yard pass to marvin harrison and a 24yard pass to reggie wayne moving the ball to the steelers 3yard line running back edgerrin james finished the drive with a 3yard touchdown run and then manning threw a pass to wayne for a successful 2point conversion cutting the colts deficit to 21–18 the steelers were forced to punt on their ensuing drive but with 120 left in the game manning was sacked on fourth and 16 at the colts 2yard line and the ball was turned over to the steelers on downs at this point the game appeared to be over however the steelers were forced to advance the ball towards another score instead of taking a quarterback kneel because the colts still had three timeouts remaining but on pittsburghs first play in which bettis tried to punch it in for an insurance touchdown he fumbled for the first time all season when linebacker gary brackett popped it from bettis hands with his helmet indianapolis defensive back nick harper recovered the ball and appeared to be on his way for an indy touchdown that would have given the colts the lead when roethlisberger made a season saving tackle at the colts 42yard line spinning around and grabbing his ankle eventually the colts then advanced to the pittsburgh 28yard line but vanderjagt who had been perfect at home in the playoffs missed a 46yard gametying field goal attempt wide right with 17 seconds left and the steelers ran out the clock this game marked the beginning of the end for vanderjagt who entered the game as the nfls alltime leader in field goal percentage the following year the colts decided to let his contract expire he spent the next season with the dallas cowboys where he made just 72 of his

conference championship games were changed from the thentraditional starting times of 1230 pm and 400 pm to 130 pm and 500 pm est respectively this was to accommodate the fact that the denver broncos and san francisco 49ers hosted the 1989–90 afc and nfc championship games in the mountain time zone and pacific time zone respectively — thus avoiding a locally played game at 930 am pst1030 am mst
