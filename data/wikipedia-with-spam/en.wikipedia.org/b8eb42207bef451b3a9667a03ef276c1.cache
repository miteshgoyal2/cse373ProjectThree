his identical twin brother was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before his own birth8 jesse was buried in an unmarked grave at priceville cemetery in tupelo9 after presley became famous he asked people on several occasions to try and find the whereabouts of jesse the efforts were to no avail because no papers marked the spot9 presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother the family attended an assembly of god church where he found his initial musical inspiration although he was in conflict with the pentecostal church in his later years he never officially left it101112 rev rex humbard officiated at presleys funeral because presley had been an admirer of humbards ministry131415 presleys ancestry was primarily a western european mix that included german16 scotsirish scottish17 and some french norman gladys would often tell the family that before the civil war her greatgreatgrandmother morning dove white was a fullblooded cherokee indian18 although some genealogists doubt the claim1920 in her book elvis and gladys elaine dundy claims that presleys greatgreatgrandmother nancy burdine tackett was jewish citing a third cousin of presleys oscar tackett21 however there is no evidence that the presley family shared this belief and the syndicated columnist nate bloom has challenged the cousins account which he calls a tall tale22 gladys was regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant member of the small family vernon moved from one odd job to the next evincing little ambition2324 the family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance the presleys survived the f5 tornado in the 1936 tupelo–gainesville tornado outbreak in 1938 they lost their home after vernon was found guilty of kiting a

first public performance tenyearold presley was dressed as a cowboy he stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang old shep he recalled placing fifth27 a few months later presley received his first guitar for his birthday he had hoped for something else—by different accounts either a bicycle or a rifle2829 over the following year he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the familys church presley recalled i took the guitar and i watched people and i learned to play a little bit but i would never sing in public i was very shy about it30 in september 1946 presley entered a new school milam for sixth grade he was regarded as a loner the following year he began bringing his guitar to school on a daily basis he played and sang during lunchtime and was often teased as a trashy kid who played hillbilly music by then the family was living in a largely africanamerican neighborhood31 presley was a devotee of mississippi slims show on the tupelo radio station welo he was described as crazy about music by slims younger brother who was one of presleys classmates and often took him into the station slim supplemented presleys guitar tuition by demonstrating chord techniques32 when his protégé was 12 years old slim scheduled him for two onair performances presley was overcome by stage fright the first time but succeeded in performing the following week33 teenage life in memphis in november 1948 the family moved to memphis tennessee after residing for nearly a year in rooming houses they were granted a twobedroom apartment in the public housing complex known as the lauderdale courts34 enrolled at l c humes high school presley received only a c in music in eighth grade when his music teacher informed him that he did not have an aptitude for singing he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit keep them cold icy fingers off me in an effort to prove otherwise a classmate later recalled that the teacher agreed that elvis was right when he said that she didnt appreciate his kind of singing35 he was usually too shy to perform openly and was occasionally bullied by classmates who viewed him as a mamas boy36 in 1950 he regularly began practicing guitar under the tutelage of jesse lee denson a neighbor twoandahalf years his senior they and three other boys—including two future rockabilly pioneers brothers dorsey and johnny burnette—formed a loose musical collective that played frequently around the courts37 that september he began ushering at loews state theater38 other jobs followed including precision tool loews again and marl metal products39 during his junior year presley began to stand out more among his classmates largely because of his appearance he grew out his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and vaseline in his free time he would head down to beale street the heart of memphiss thriving blues scene and gaze longingly at the wild flashy clothes in the windows of lansky brothers by his senior year he was wearing them40 overcoming his reticence about performing outside the lauderdale courts he competed in humess annual minstrel show in april 1953 singing and playing guitar he opened with till i waltz again with you a recent hit for teresa brewer presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation i wasnt popular in school  i failed music—only thing i ever failed and then they entered me in this talent show  when i came onstage i heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth cause nobody knew i even sang it was amazing how popular i became after that41 presley who received no formal music training and could not read music studied and played by ear he also frequented record stores that provided jukeboxes and listening booths to customers he knew all of hank snows songs42 and he loved records by other country singers such as roy acuff ernest tubb ted daffan jimmie rodgers jimmie davis and bob wills43 the southern gospel singer jake hess one of his favorite performers was a significant influence on his balladsinging style4445 he was a regular audience member at the monthly allnight singings downtown where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of africanamerican spiritual music46 he adored the music of black gospel singer sister rosetta tharpe43 like some of his peers he may have attended blues venues—of necessity in the segregated south on only the nights designated for exclusively white audiences47 he certainly listened to the regional radio stations such as wdiaam that played race records spirituals blues and the modern backbeatheavy sound of rhythm and blues48 many of his future recordings were inspired by local africanamerican musicians such as arthur crudup and rufus thomas4950 bb king recalled that he had known presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent beale street51 by the time he graduated from high school in june 1953 presley had already singled out music as his future5253 after graduating from secondary school presley thought for a short time about joining a gospel group he attempted to join a group called songfellows who sang at the local church but he was unsuccessful54 he worked on an assembly line in his first job which he quit after a few weeks because he disliked the work he then decided to become an apprentice electrician at crown electric54 1953–1955 first recordings sam phillips and sun records see also list of songs recorded by elvis presley on the sun label presley in a sun records promotional photograph 1954 in august 1953 presley walked into the offices of sun records he aimed to pay for a few minutes of studio time to record a twosided acetate disc my happiness55 and thats when your heartaches begin he would later claim that he intended the record as a gift for his mother or that he was merely interested in what he sounded like although there was a much cheaper amateur recordmaking service at a nearby general store biographer peter guralnick argues that he chose sun in the hope of being discovered asked by receptionist marion keisker what kind of singer he was presley responded i sing all kinds when she pressed him on who he sounded like he repeatedly answered i dont sound like nobody after he recorded sun boss sam phillips asked keisker to note down the young mans name which she did along with her own commentary good ballad singer hold56 in january 1954 presley cut a second acetate at sun records—ill never stand in your way and it wouldnt be the same without you—but again nothing came of it57 not long after he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet the songfellows he explained to his father they told me i couldnt sing58 songfellow jim hamill later claimed that he was turned down because he did not demonstrate an ear for harmony at the time59 in april presley began working for the crown electric company as a truck driver60 his friend ronnie smith after playing a few local gigs with him suggested he contact eddie bond leader of smiths professional band which had an opening for a vocalist bond rejected him after a tryout advising presley to stick to truck driving because youre never going to make it as a singer61 phillips meanwhile was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom sun focused as keisker reported over and over i remember sam saying if i could find a white man who had the negro sound and the negro feel i could make a billion dollars62 in june he acquired a demo recording by jimmy sweeney of a ballad without you that he thought might suit the teenage singer presley came by the studio but was unable to do it justice despite this phillips asked presley to sing as many numbers as he knew he was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians guitarist winfield scotty moore and upright bass player bill black to work something up with presley for a recording session63 thats all right presley transformed not only the sound but the emotion of the song turning what had been written as a lament for a lost love into a satisfied declaration of independence64 problems playing this file see media help the session held the evening of july 5 1954 proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night as they were about to give up and go home presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number arthur crudups thats all right moore recalled all of a sudden elvis just started singing this song jumping around and acting the fool and then bill picked up his bass and he started acting the fool too and i started playing with them sam i think had the door to the control booth open  he stuck his head out and said what are you doing and we said we dont know well back up he said try to find a place to start and do it again phillips quickly began taping this was the sound he had been looking for65 three days later popular memphis dj dewey phillips played thats all right on his whbq red hot and blue show66 listeners began phoning in eager to find out who the singer was the interest was such that phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show interviewing presley onair phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black5567 during the next few days the trio recorded a bluegrass number bill monroes blue moon of kentucky again in a distinctive style and employing an audio delay echo effect that sam phillips dubbed slapback a single was pressed with thats all right on the a side and blue moon of kentucky on the reverse68 early live performances and signing with rca the trio played publicly for the first time on july 17 at the bon air club—presley still sporting his childsize guitar69 at the end of the month they appeared at the overton park shell with slim whitman headlining a combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness at playing before a large crowd led presley to shake his legs as he performed his widecut pants emphasized his movements causing young women in the audience to start screaming70 moore recalled during the instrumental parts he would back off from the mike and be playing and shaking and the crowd would just go wild71 black a natural showman whooped and rode his bass hitting double licks that presley would later remember as really a wild sound like a jungle drum or something71 soon after moore and black quit their old band the starlite wranglers to play with presley regularly and dj and promoter bob neal became the trios manager from august through october they played frequently at the eagles nest club and returned to sun studio for more recording sessions72 and presley quickly grew more confident on stage according to moore his movement was a natural thing but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction hed do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick73 presley made what would be his only appearance on nashvilles grand ole opry on october 2 after a polite audience response opry manager jim denny told phillips that his singer was not bad but did not suit the program7475 two weeks later presley was booked on louisiana hayride the oprys chief and more adventurous rival the shreveportbased show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states presley had another attack of nerves during the first set which drew a muted reaction a more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response76 house drummer d j fontana brought a new element complementing presleys movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in strip clubs77 soon after the show the hayride engaged presley for a years worth of saturdaynight appearances trading in his old guitar for 8 and seeing it promptly dispatched to the garbage he purchased a martin instrument for 175 and his trio began playing in new locales including houston texas and texarkana arkansas78 by early 1955 presleys regular hayride appearances constant touring and wellreceived record releases had made him a regional star from tennessee to west texas in january neal signed a formal management contract with presley and brought the singer to the attention of colonel tom parker whom he considered the best promoter in the music business having successfully managed top country star eddy arnold parker was now working with the new numberone country singer hank snow parker booked presley on snows february tour7980 when the tour reached odessa texas a 19yearold roy orbison saw presley for the first time his energy was incredible his instinct was just amazing  i just didnt know what to make of it there was just no reference point in the culture to compare it42 presley made his television debut on march 3 on the kslatv broadcast of louisiana hayride soon after he failed an audition for arthur godfreys talent scouts on the cbs television network by august sun had released ten sides credited to elvis presley scotty and bill on the latest recordings the trio were joined by a drummer some of the songs like thats all right were in what one memphis journalist described as the rb idiom of negro field jazz others like blue moon of kentucky were more in the country field but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both81 this blend of styles made it difficult for presleys music to find radio airplay according to neal many countrymusic disc jockeys would not play it because he sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rhythmandblues stations would touch him because he sounded too much like a hillbilly82 the blend came to be known as rockabilly at the time presley was variously billed as the king of western bop the hillbilly cat and the memphis flash83 presley renewed neals management contract in august 1955 simultaneously appointing parker as his special adviser84 the group maintained an extensive touring schedule throughout the second half of the year85 neal recalled it was almost frightening the reaction that came to elvis from the teenaged boys so many of them through some sort of jealousy would practically hate him there were occasions in some towns in texas when wed have to be sure to have a police guard because somebodyd always try to take a crack at him theyd get a gang and try to waylay him or something86 the trio became a quartet when hayride drummer fontana joined as a full member in midoctober they played a few shows in support of bill haley whose rock around the clock had been a numberone hit the previous year haley observed that presley had a natural feel for rhythm and advised him to sing fewer ballads87 at the country disc jockey convention in early november presley was voted the years most promising male artist88 several record companies had by now shown interest in signing him after three major labels made offers of up to 25000 parker and phillips struck a deal with rca victor on november 21 to acquire presleys sun contract for an unprecedented 4000089b presley at 20 was still a minor so his father signed the contract90 parker arranged with the owners of hill and range publishing jean and julian aberbach to create two entities elvis presley music and gladys music to handle all the new material recorded by presley songwriters were obliged to forgo one third of their customary royalties in exchange for having him perform their compositions91c by december rca had begun to heavily promote its new singer and before months end had reissued many of his sun recordings94 1956–1958 commercial breakout and controversy first national tv appearances and debut album publicity photo for the cbs program stage show january 16 1956 on january 10 1956 presley made his first recordings for rca in nashville95 extending the singers by now customary backup of moore black and fontana rca enlisted pianist floyd cramer guitarist chet atkins and three background singers including first tenor gordon stoker of the popular jordanaires quartet to fill out the sound96 the session produced the moody unusual heartbreak hotel released as a single on january 2795 parker finally brought presley to national television booking him on cbss stage show for six appearances over two months the program produced in new york was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers tommy and jimmy dorsey after his first appearance on january 28 introduced by disc jockey bill randle presley stayed in town to record at rcas new york studio the sessions yielded eight songs including a cover of carl perkins rockabilly anthem blue suede shoes in february presleys i forgot to remember to forget a sun recording initially released the previous august reached the top of the billboard country chart97 neals contract was terminated and on march 2 parker became presleys manager98 gladys presley was worried about how the fans were reacting to presley and had hardly been to any of her sons performances because she was worried he was going to get hurt she remarked to him repeatedly elvis the colonel is going to work you to your death it aint right99 on march 12 1956100 elvis purchased a onestory ranchstyle house with twocar attached garage101 in a quiet residential neighborhood on audubon street in memphis the home was profiled in national magazines and soon became a focal point for fans media and celebrities to visit100 elvis lived here with his parents between march 1956 and march 1957102 the cover of presleys 1956 debut album103 rca victor released presleys eponymous debut album on march 23 joined by five previously unreleased sun recordings its seven recently recorded tracks were of a broad variety there were two country songs and a bouncy pop tune the others would centrally define the evolving sound of rock and roll blue suede shoes—an improvement over perkins in almost every way according to critic robert hilburn—and three rb numbers that had been part of presleys stage repertoire for some time covers of little richard55 ray charles and the drifters as described by hilburn these were the most revealing of all unlike many white artists  who watered down the gritty edges of the original rb versions of songs in the 50s presley reshaped them he not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar not piano the lead instrument in all three cases104 it became the first rockandroll album to top the billboard chart a position it held for 10 weeks95 while presley was not an innovative guitarist like moore or contemporary african american rockers bo diddley and chuck berry cultural historian gilbert b rodman argues that the albums cover image of elvis having the time of his life on stage with a guitar in his hands played a crucial role in positioning the guitar  as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music105 milton berle show and hound dog presley signing autographs in minneapolis in 1956 on april 3 presley made the first of two appearances on nbcs milton berle show his performance on the deck of the uss hancock in san diego prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates106 a few days later a flight taking presley and his band to nashville for a recording session left all three badly shaken when an engine died and the plane almost went down over arkansas107 twelve weeks after its original release heartbreak hotel became presleys first numberone pop hit in late april presley began a twoweek residency at the new frontier hotel and casino on the las vegas strip the shows were poorly received by the conservative middleaged hotel guests108—like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party wrote a critic for newsweek109 amid his vegas tenure presley who had serious acting ambitions signed a sevenyear contract with paramount pictures110 he began a tour of the midwest in midmay taking in 15 cities in as many days111 he had attended several shows by freddie bell and the bellboys in vegas and was struck by their cover of hound dog a hit in 1953 for blues singer big mama thornton by songwriters jerry leiber and mike stoller108 it became the new closing number of his act112 after a show in la crosse wisconsin an urgent message on the letterhead of the local catholic dioceses newspaper was sent to fbi director j edgar hoover it warned that presley is a definite danger to the security of the united states  his actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth  after the show more than 1000 teenagers tried to gang into presleys room at the auditorium  indications of the harm presley did just in la crosse were the two high school girls  whose abdomen and thigh had presleys autograph113 the second milton berle show appearance came on june 5 at nbcs hollywood studio amid another hectic tour berle persuaded the singer to leave his guitar backstage advising let em see you son114 during the performance presley abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of hound dog with a wave of his arm and launched into a slow grinding version accentuated with energetic exaggerated body movements114 presleys gyrations created a storm of controversy115 newspaper critics were outraged jack gould of the new york times wrote mr presley has no discernible singing ability  his phrasing if it can be called that consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginners aria in a bathtub  his one specialty is an accented movement of the body  primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway116 ben gross of the new york daily news opined that popular music has reached its lowest depths in the grunt and groin antics of one elvis presley  elvis who rotates his pelvis  gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos117 ed sullivan whose own variety show was the nations most popular declared him unfit for family viewing118 to presleys displeasure he soon found himself being referred to as elvis the pelvis which he called one of the most childish expressions i ever heard comin from an adult119 steve allen show and first sullivan appearance ed sullivan and presley during rehearsals for his second appearance on the ed sullivan show october 26 1956 the berle shows drew such high ratings that presley was booked for a july 1 appearance on nbcs steve allen show in new york allen no fan of rock and roll introduced a new elvis in a white bow tie and black tails presley sang hound dog for less than a minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie as described by television historian jake austen allen thought presley was talentless and absurd  he set things up so that presley would show his contrition120 allen for his part later wrote that he found presleys strange gangly countryboy charisma his hardtodefine cuteness and his charming eccentricity intriguing and simply worked the singer into the customary comedy fabric of his program121 just before the final rehearsal for the show presley told a reporter im holding down on this show i dont want to do anything to make people dislike me i think tv is important so im going to go along but i wont be able to give the kind of show i do in a personal appearance122 presley would refer back to the allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career123 later that night he appeared on hy gardner calling a popular local tv show pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected presley responded no i havent i dont feel like im doing anything wrong  i dont see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when its only music  i mean how would rock n roll music make anyone rebel against their parents117 presley with his backup group the jordanaires march 1957 the next day presley recorded hound dog along with any way you want me and dont be cruel the jordanaires sang harmony as they had on the steve allen show they would work with presley through the 1960s a few days later the singer made an outdoor concert appearance in memphis at which he announced you know those people in new york are not gonna change me none im gonna show you what the real elvis is like tonight124 in august a judge in jacksonville florida ordered presley to tame his act throughout the following performance he largely kept still except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order125 the single pairing dont be cruel with hound dog ruled the top of the charts for 11 weeks—a mark that would not be surpassed for 36 years126 recording sessions for presleys second album took place in hollywood during the first week of september leiber and stoller the writers of hound dog contributed love me108127 allens show with presley had for the first time beaten cbss ed sullivan show in the ratings sullivan despite his june pronouncement booked the singer for three appearances for an unprecedented 50000128108 the first on september 9 1956 was seen by approximately 60 million viewers—a record 826 percent of the television audience129 actor charles laughton hosted the show filling in while sullivan recuperated from a car accident118 presley appeared in two segments that night from cbs television city in los angeles during which he was shot from only the waist up108 watching clips of the allen and berle shows with his producer sullivan said that presley got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pants–so when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock  i think its a coke bottle  we just cant have this on a sunday night this is a family show130 sullivan publicly told tv guide as for his gyrations the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots128 in fact presley was shown headtotoe in the first and second shows though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut with legconcealing closeups when he danced the studio audience reacted in customary style screaming131132 presleys performance of his forthcoming single the ballad love me tender prompted a recordshattering million advance orders133 more than any other single event it was this first appearance on the ed sullivan show that made presley a national celebrity118 accompanying presleys rise to fame a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize igniting the biggest pop craze since glenn miller and frank sinatra  presley brought rocknroll into the mainstream of popular culture writes historian marty jezer as presley set the artistic pace other artists followed  presley more than anyone else gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generation—the first in america ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture134 crazed crowds and film debut presley performing live at the mississippialabama fairgrounds in tupelo september 26 1956 were gonna do a sad song  presleys definition of rock and roll included a sense of humor—here during his second sullivan appearance he introduces one of his signature numbers problems playing this file see media help the audience response at presleys live shows became increasingly fevered moore recalled hed start out you aint nothin but a hound dog and theyd just go to pieces theyd always react the same way thered be a riot every time135 at the two concerts he performed in september at the mississippialabama fair and dairy show 50 national guardsmen were added to the police security to prevent crowd trouble136 elvis presleys second album was released in october and quickly rose to number one the album includes old shep which he sang at the talent show in 1945 and which now marked the first time he played piano on an rca session according to guralnick one can hear in the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm both the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique137 assessing the musical and cultural

his latest number one record love me tender had hit the top of the charts earlier that month to further take advantage of presleys popularity four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role the film was panned by the critics but did very well at the box office110 on december 4 presley dropped into sun records where carl perkins and jerry lee lewis were recording and jammed with them though phillips no longer had the right to release any presley material he made sure the session was captured on tape the results were notable as the million dollar quartet

stoller collaboration and draft notice presley made his third and final ed sullivan show appearance on january 6 1957—on this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist some commentators have claimed that parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity132142 in any event as critic greil marcus describes presley did not tie himself down leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha if not a harem girl from the makeup over his eyes the hair falling in his face the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth he was playing rudolph valentino in the sheik with all stops out118 to close displaying his range and defying sullivans wishes presley sang a gentle black spiritual peace in the valley at the

then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for jailhouse rock presleys next film the songwriting team effectively produced the jailhouse sessions and developed a close working relationship with presley who came to regard them as his goodluck charm148 leiber remembered initially finding presley not quite authentic—after all he was a white singer and my standards were black149 according to stoller the duo was surprised at the kind of knowledge that he had about black music we figured that he had these remarkable pipes and all that but we didnt realize that he knew so much about the blues we were quite surprised to find out that he knew as much about it as we did he certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music150 leiber remembered the recording process with presley he was fast any demo you gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes 149 as stoller recalled presley was protected by his manager and entourage he was removed they kept him separate150 presley undertook three brief tours during the year continuing to generate a crazed audience response151 a detroit newspaper suggested that the trouble with going to see elvis presley

just the same as he faced when he started years ago155 presley and dolores hart in king creole 1958 leiber and stoller were again in the studio for the recording of elvis christmas album toward the end of the session they wrote a song on the spot at presleys request santa claus is back in town an innuendoladen blues156 the holiday release stretched presleys string of number one albums to four and would eventually become the best selling christmas album of all time157158 after the session moore and black—drawing only modest weekly salaries sharing in none of presleys massive financial success—resigned though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later it was clear that they had not been part of presleys inner circle for some time159 on december 20 presley received

friends in the outfit joined him in indulging168 the army also introduced presley to karate which he seriously studied and later included his live performances169 fellow soldiers have attested to presleys wish to be seen as an able ordinary soldier despite his fame and to his generosity he donated his army pay to charity purchased tv sets for the base and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit170 while in friedberg presley met 14yearold priscilla beaulieu they would eventually marry after a sevenandahalfyear courtship171 in her autobiography priscilla says that despite his worries that it would ruin his career parker convinced presley that to gain popular respect he should serve his country as a regular soldier rather than in special services where he would have been able to give some musical performances and remain in touch with the public172 media reports echoed presleys concerns about his career but rca producer steve sholes and freddy bienstock of hill and range had carefully prepared for his twoyear hiatus armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material they kept up a regular stream of successful releases173 between his induction and discharge presley had ten top 40 hits including wear my ring around your neck the bestselling hard headed woman and one night174 in 1958 and now and then theres a fool such as i and the number one a

nashville session two weeks later yielded a pair of his bestselling singles the ballads its now or never and are you lonesome tonight181 along with the rest of elvis is back the album features several songs described by greil marcus as full of chicago blues menace driven by presleys own supermiked acoustic guitar brilliant playing by scotty moore and demonic sax work from boots randolph elviss singing wasnt sexy it was pornographic182 as a whole the record conjured up the vision of a performer who could be all things in the words of music historian john robertson a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold a tempestuous dangerous lover a gutbucket blues singer a sophisticated nightclub entertainer a raucous rocker183 presley with juliet prowse in gi blues on may 12 presley returned

preceding the event rca presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records185 a 12hour nashville session in midmarch yielded nearly all of presleys next studio album something for everybody186 as described by john robertson it exemplifies the nashville sound the restrained cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s presaging much of what was to come from presley himself over the next halfdecade the album is largely a pleasant unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been elviss birthright187 it would be his sixth number one lp on march 25 1961 elvis presley performed a benefit concert at the block arena in pearl harbor hawaii to raise funds for the memorial to the uss arizona which was sunk at pearl harbor this was to be presleys last public performance for seven years188 lost in hollywood parker had by now pushed presley into a heavy film making schedule focused on formulaic modestly budgeted musical comedies presley at first insisted on pursuing more serious roles but when two films in a more dramatic vein—flaming star 1960 and wild in the country 1961—were less commercially successful he reverted to the formula among the 27 films he made during the 1960s there were few further exceptions189 his films were almost universally panned critic andrew caine dismissed them as a pantheon of bad taste190 nonetheless they were virtually all profitable hal wallis who produced nine of them declared a presley picture is the only sure thing in hollywood191 of presleys films in the 1960s 15 were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another 5 by soundtrack eps the films rapid production and release schedules—he frequently starred in three a year—affected his music according to jerry leiber the soundtrack formula was already evident before presley left for the army three ballads one mediumtempo number one uptempo and one break blues boogie192 as the decade wore on the quality of the soundtrack songs grew progressively worse193 julie parrish who appeared in paradise hawaiian style 1966 says that he hated many of the songs chosen for his films194 the jordanaires gordon stoker describes how presley would retreat from the studio microphone the material was so bad that he felt like he couldnt sing it195 most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of doc pomus and mort shuman but by and large according to biographer jerry hopkins the numbers seemed to be written on order by men who never really understood elvis or rock and roll196 regardless of the songs quality it has been argued that presley generally sang them well with commitment197 critic dave marsh heard the opposite presley isnt trying probably the wisest course in the face of material like no room to rumba in a sports car and rockahula baby138 in the first half of the decade three of presleys soundtrack albums hit number one on the pop charts and a few of his most popular songs came from his films such as cant help falling in love 1961 and return to sender 1962 viva las vegas the title track to the 1964 film was a minor hit as a bside and became truly popular only later but as with artistic merit the commercial returns steadily diminished during a fiveyear span—1964 through 1968—presley had only one topten hit crying in the chapel 1965 a gospel number recorded back in 1960 as for nonfilm albums between the june 1962 release of pot luck and the november 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback only one lp of new material by presley was issued the gospel album how great thou art 1967 it won him his first grammy award for best sacred performance as marsh described presley was arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time and really the last rock roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs198 shortly before christmas 1966 more than seven years since they first met presley proposed to priscilla beaulieu they were married on may 1 1967 in a brief ceremony in their suite at the aladdin hotel in las vegas199 priscilla presley claims in her autobiography that she was a virgin until their wedding night which was given credibility due to the fact that lisa marie was born nine months later200 however biographer suzanne finstad has questioned this claim200 the flow of formulaic films and assemblyline soundtracks rolled on it was not until october 1967 when the clambake soundtrack lp registered record low sales for a new presley album that rca executives recognized a problem by then of course the damage had been done as historians connie kirchberg and marc hendrickx put it elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a hasbeen to

comeback special the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—presleys first live performances since 1961 the live segments saw presley clad in tight black leather singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rockandroll days bill belew who designed this outfit gave it a napoleonic standing collar presley customarily wore high collars because he believed his neck looked too long a design feature that he would later make a major trademark of the outfits presley wore on stage in his later years director and coproducer steve binder had worked hard to reassure the nervous singer and to produce a show that was far from the hour of christmas songs parker had originally planned207 the show nbcs highest rated that season captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience208 jon landau of eye magazine remarked there is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home he sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock n roll singers he moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made jim morrison green with envy209 dave marsh calls the performance one of emotional grandeur and historical resonance210 by january 1969 the single if i can dream written for the special reached number 12 the soundtrack album broke into the top ten according to friend jerry schilling the special reminded presley of what he had not been able to do for years being able to choose the people being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack  he was out of prison man208 binder said of presleys reaction i played elvis the 60minute show and he told me in the screening room steve its the greatest thing ive ever done in my life i give you my word i will never sing a song i dont believe in208 from elvis in memphis and the international power of my love beginning with his american sound

in which presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years he sings country songs soul songs and rockers with real conviction a stunning achievement212 presley was keen to resume regular live performing following the success of the comeback special offers came in from around the world the london palladium offered parker 28000 for a oneweek engagement he responded thats fine for me now how much can you get for elvis213 in may the brand new international hotel in las vegas boasting the largest showroom in the city announced that

threat seriously and security was stepped up for the next two shows presley went onstage with a derringer in his right boot and a 45 pistol in his waistband but the concerts went off without incident227228 the album thats the way it is produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings marked a stylistic shift as music historian john robertson notes the authority of presleys singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the americanroots inspiration of the memphis sessions towards a more middleoftheroad sound with country put on the back burner and soul and rb left in memphis what was left was very classy very clean white pop—perfect for the las vegas crowd but a definite retrograde step for elvis229 after the end of his international engagement on september 7 presley embarked on a weeklong concert tour largely of the south his first since 1958 another weeklong tour of the west coast followed in november230 presley meets us president richard nixon in the white house oval office december 21 1970 on december 21 1970 presley engineered a meeting with president richard nixon at the white house where he expressed his patriotism and his contempt for the hippies the growing drug culture and the counterculture in general231 he asked nixon for a bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs badge to add to similar items he had begun collecting and to signify official sanction of his patriotic efforts nixon who apparently found the encounter awkward expressed a belief that presley could send a positive message to young people and that it was therefore important he retain his credibility presley told nixon that the beatles whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era232 exemplified what he saw as a trend of antiamericanism and drug abuse in popular culture233 on hearing reports of the meeting paul mccartney later said he felt a bit betrayed and commented the great joke was that

that focused on genre standards237 the biggest seller was elvis sings the wonderful world of christmas the truest statement of all according to greil marcus in the midst of ten painfully genteel christmas songs every one sung with appalling sincerity and humility one could find elvis tomcatting his way through six blazing minutes of merry christmas baby a raunchy old charles brown blues238 according to guralnick the one real highlight of one of the 1971 sessions were the recording of i will be true its still here and ill take you home again kathleen a trio of songs that presley recorded in a rare solo set sitting at the piano after everyone else had gone home yearning wistfulness loneliness need—all were communicated with a naked lack of adornment that elvis was seeming to find

scheduled on january 14 aloha from hawaii was the first global concert satellite broadcast reaching millions of viewers live and on tape delay251252253 presleys costume became the most recognized example of the elaborate concert garb with which his latterday persona became closely associated as described by bobbie ann mason at the end of the show when he spreads out his american eagle cape with the full stretched wings of the eagle studded on the back he becomes a god figure254 the accompanying double album released in february went to number one and eventually sold over 5 million

security men leapt to presleys defense and the singers karate instinct took over as he ejected one invader from the stage himself following the show he became obsessed with the idea that the men had been sent by mike stone to kill him though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans he raged theres too much pain in me  stone must die his outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him despite administering large doses of medication after another two full days of raging red west his friend and bodyguard felt compelled to get a price for a contract

the singers arrival at a university of maryland concert he fell out of the limousine to his knees people jumped to help and he pushed them away like dont help me he walked on stage and held onto the mike for the first thirty minutes like it was a post everybodys looking at each other like is the tour gonna happen262 guitarist john wilkinson recalled he was all gut he was slurring he was so fucked up  it was obvious he was drugged it was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body it was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible  i remember crying he could barely get through the introductions263 wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in detroit i watched him in his dressing room just draped over a chair unable to move so often i thought boss why dont you just cancel this tour and take a year off  i mentioned something once in a guarded moment he patted me on the back and said itll be all right dont you worry about it263 presley continued to play to sellout crowds presley began speaking to the audience between songs about various different things264 during one live performance he spoke about a movie magazine which said he was strung out because of his

presleys stepbrother david stanley has claimed that the bodyguards were fired because they were becoming more outspoken about presleys drug dependency270 rca which had enjoyed a steady stream of product from presley for over a decade grew anxious as his interest in spending time in the studio waned after a december 1973 session that produced 18 songs enough for almost two albums he did not enter the studio in 1974271 parker sold rca on another concert record elvis recorded live on stage in memphis272 recorded on march 20 it included a version of how great thou art that would win presley his third and final competitive grammy award273 all three of his competitive grammy wins—out of 14 total nominations—were for gospel recordings presley returned to the studio in hollywood in march 1975 but parkers attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful274 in 1976 rca sent a mobile studio to graceland that made possible two fullscale recording sessions at presleys home275 even in that comfortable context the recording process was now a struggle for him276 hurt an rb hit for roy hamilton in 1955 and a pop hit for blueeyed soul singer timi yuro in 1961 presleys deep soul version was picked up by country radio in 1976277 problems playing this file see media help for all the concerns of his label and manager in studio sessions between july 1973

and three went to number one promised land 1975 from elvis presley boulevard memphis tennessee 1976 and moody blue 1977278 the story was similar with his singles—there were no major pop hits but presley was a significant force in not just the country market but on adult contemporary radio as well eight studio singles from this period released during his lifetime were top ten hits on one or both charts four in 1974 alone my boy was a number one adult contemporary hit in 1975 and moody blue topped the country chart and reached the second spot on the adult contemporary chart in 1976279 perhaps his most critically acclaimed recording of the era came that year with what greil marcus described as his apocalyptic attack on the soul classic hurt280 if he felt the way he sounded dave marsh wrote of presleys performance the wonder isnt that he had only a year left to live but that he managed to survive that long281 final year and death presley and linda thompson split in november 1976 and he took up with a new girlfriend ginger alden282 he proposed to alden and gave her an engagement ring two months later though several of his friends later claimed that he had no serious intention of marrying again283 journalist tony scherman writes that by early 1977 presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek energetic former self hugely overweight his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts284 in alexandria louisiana the singer was on stage for less than an hour and was impossible to understand285 presley failed to appear in baton rouge he was unable to get out of his hotel bed and the rest of the tour was cancelled285 despite the accelerating deterioration of his health he stuck to most touring commitments in rapid city south dakota he was so nervous on stage that he could hardly talk according to presley historian samuel roy and unable to perform any significant movement286 guralnick relates that fans were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment but it all seemed to go right past presley whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books287 a cousin billy smith recalled how presley would sit in his room and chat for hours sometimes recounting favorite monty python sketches and his own past escapades but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions that reminded smith of howard hughes288 way down presleys last single issued during his lifetime came out on june 6 on the next tour cbs filmed two concerts for a tv special elvis in concert to be aired in october on the first of these captured in omaha on june 19 presleys voice guralnick writes is almost unrecognizable a small childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs casts about uncertainly for the melody in others and is virtually unable to articulate or project289 he did better on the second night two days later in rapid city he looked healthier seemed to have lost a little weight and sounded better too though his appearance was still a face framed in a helmet of blueblack hair from which sweat sheets down over pale swollen cheeks290 his final concert was held in indianapolis indiana at market square arena on june 26 presleys gravestone at graceland the book elvis what happened cowritten by the three bodyguards fired the previous year was published on august 1291 it was the first exposé to detail presleys years of drug misuse he was devastated by the book and tried unsuccessfully to halt its release by offering money to the publishers292 by this point he suffered from multiple ailments glaucoma high blood pressure liver damage and an enlarged colon each aggravated—and possibly caused—by drug abuse259 genetic analysis of a hair sample in 2014 found evidence of genetic variants that could have caused his glaucoma migraines and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy293294 in addition his drug abuse had led to falls head trauma and overdoses that most likely had damaged his brain295 on the evening of august 16 1977 presley was scheduled to fly out of memphis to begin another tour that afternoon ginger alden discovered him in an unresponsive state on his bathroom floor according to her eyewitness account elvis looked as if his entire body had completely frozen in a seated position while using the toilet and then had fallen forward in that fixed position directly in front of it it was clear that from the time whatever hit him to the moment he had landed on the floor elvis hadnt moved296 joel williamson writes for some reason — perhaps involving a reaction to the codeine and attempts to move his bowels — he experienced pain and fright while sitting on the toilet alarmed he stood up dropped the book he was reading stumbled forward and fell face down in the fetal position he struggled weakly and drooled on the rug unable to breathe he died297 attempts to revive him failed and death was officially pronounced at 330 pm at baptist memorial hospital298 president jimmy carter issued a statement that credited presley with having permanently changed the face of american popular culture299 thousands of people gathered outside graceland to view the open casket one of presleys cousins billy mann accepted 18000 to secretly photograph the corpse the picture appeared on the cover of the national enquirers biggestselling issue ever300 alden struck a 105000 deal with the enquirer for her story but settled for less when she broke her exclusivity agreement301 presley left her nothing in his will302 presleys funeral was held at graceland on thursday august 18 outside the gates a car plowed into a group of fans killing two women and critically injuring a third303 approximately 80000 people lined the processional route to forest hill cemetery where presley was buried next to his mother304 within a few days way down topped the country and uk pop charts279305 following an attempt to steal the singers body in late august the remains of both presley and his mother were reburied in gracelands meditation garden on october 2301 since his death there have been numerous alleged sightings of presley a longstanding conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death306307 fans have noted alleged discrepancies in the death certificate reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin and numerous accounts of presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace308 questions over cause of death drug use was heavily implicated in presleys death wrote guralnick no one ruled out the possibility of anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills  to which he was known to have had a mild allergy a pair of lab reports that were filed two months later strongly suggested that polypharmacy was the primary cause of death one reported fourteen drugs in elvis system ten in significant quantity309 forensic historian and pathologist michael baden viewed the situation as complicated elvis had had an enlarged heart for a long time that together with his drug habit caused his death but he was difficult to diagnose it was a judgment call310 the competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned before the autopsy was complete and toxicology results known medical examiner dr jerry francisco declared the cause of death as cardiac arrhythmia a condition that can be determined only in someone who is still alive311 allegations of a coverup were widespread310 while presleys main physician dr nichopoulos was exonerated of criminal liability for the singers death the facts were startling in the first eight months of 1977 alone he had prescribed more than 10000 doses of sedatives amphetamines and narcotics all in elviss name his license was suspended for three months it was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the tennessee medical board brought new charges of overprescription259 amidst mounting pressure in 1994 the presley autopsy was reopened coroner dr joseph davis declared there is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs in fact everything points to a sudden violent heart attack259 whether or not combined drug intoxication was in fact the cause there is little doubt that polypharmacy contributed significantly to presleys premature death311 more recent research has revealed that it was only dr francisco who told the news people that elvis apparently died of heart failure in fact the doctors could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories if then that would be a matter of weeks one of the examiners dr e eric muirhead could not believe his ears francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospitals team of pathologists he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached early on a meticulous dissection of the body confirmed that elvis was chronically ill with diabetes glaucoma and constipation as they proceeded the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs they had also studied his hospital records which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatments312 therefore frank coffey is of the opinion that a plausible cause of elvis death is a phenomenon called the valsalva maneuver essentially straining on the toilet leading to heart stoppage — plausible because elvis suffered constipation a common reaction to drug use313 in similar terms dr dan warlick who was present at the autopsy believes presleys chronic constipation — the result of years of prescription drug abuse and highfat highcholesterol gorging — brought on whats known as valsalvas maneuver put simply the strain of attempting to defecate compressed the singers abdominal aorta shutting down his heart314 since 1977 between 1977 and 1981 six of presleys posthumously released singles were top ten country hits279 graceland was opened to the public in 1982 attracting over half a million visitors annually it is the second mostvisited home in the united states after the white house315 it

bearing a striking resemblance to elvis was displayed ahead of an intended auction341 a spokesman for the auctioneers said that fans could be forgiven for thinking that their idol may well have lived a previous life in rome341 every august 16 the anniversary date of his death thousands of people gather at his home in memphis and celebrate his memory during a candlelight ritual342 artistry influences presleys earliest musical influence came from gospel his mother recalled that from the age of two at the assembly of god church in tupelo attended by the family he would slide down off my lap run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform there he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them343 in memphis presley frequently attended allnight gospel singings at the ellis auditorium where groups such as the statesmen quartet led the music in a style that guralnick suggests sowed the seeds of presleys future stage act the statesmen were an electric combination  featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world  dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of lanskys  bass singer jim wetherington known universally as the big chief maintained a steady bottom ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg then his right with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering he went about as far as you could go in gospel music said jake hess the women would jump up just like they do for the pop shows preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements  but audiences reacted with screams and swoons344 as a teenager presleys musical interests were wideranging and he was deeply informed about african american musical idioms as well as white ones see teenage life in memphis though he never had any formal training he was blessed with a remarkable memory and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings in 1954 at the age of 19 when jerry leiber and mike stoller met him two years later they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues345 at a press conference the following year he proudly declared i know practically every religious song thats ever been written153 musical style and genres presley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly according to music historians katherine charlton even calls him rockabillys originator346 though carl perkins has explicitly stated that sam phillips elvis and i didnt create rockabilly347 and according to michael campbell bill haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit348 it had been there for quite a while says scotty moore carl perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around jackson and i know for a fact jerry lee lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old349 however rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with elvis presleys first release on the sun label writes craig morrison350 paul friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly which he similarly characterizes as essentially  an elvis presley construction the raw emotive and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling of the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar of country351 in thats all right the presley trios first record scotty moores guitar solo a combination of merle travis–style country fingerpicking doublestop slides from acoustic boogie and bluesbased bentnote singlestring work is a microcosm of this fusion351 at rca presleys rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals more heavily amplified electric guitars352 and a tougher more intense manner353 while he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabillyrock and roll treatment he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career from the pop standard blue moon at sun to the country ballad hows the world treating you on his second lp to the blues of santa claus is back in town in 1957 his first gospel record was released the foursong ep peace in the valley certified as a million seller it became the topselling gospel ep in recording history354 presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life run on from how great thou art 1967 a traditional song popular in the black gospel tradition the arrangement evokes the percussive style of the 1930s golden gate quartet355356 problems playing this file see media help after his return from military service in 1960 presley continued to perform rock and roll but the characteristic style was substantially toned down the reason why the music from this period lacks the drama from his fifties recordings critic dave marsh writes is because what were hearing is not genius discovering itself but the sound of genius at work357 his first postarmy single the number one hit stuck on you is typical of this shift rca publicity materials referred to its mild rock beat discographer ernst jorgensen calls it upbeat pop358 the modern bluesrb sound captured so successfully on elvis is back was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966–67 recordings as down in the alley and hiheel sneakers359 though marsh holds that while he may have recorded few blues songs in the early to middle sixties blues informs almost everything here357 the singers output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music often in the form of ballads such as are you lonesome tonight a number one in 1960 while that was a dramatic number most of what presley recorded for his film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein360 notable numbers in other genres are the no 1 hits its now or never of 1960 based on the italian aria o sole mio and concluding with a fullvoiced operatic cadence 361 and the 1962 hit shes not you which integrates the jordanaires so completely its practically doowop357 while presley performed several of his classic ballads for the 68 comeback special the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll he would record few new straightahead rock and roll songs thereafter as he explained they were hard to find362 a significant exception was burning love his last major hit on the pop charts like his work of the 1950s presleys subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs but in markedly different permutations his stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk much of elvis in memphis as well as suspicious minds cut at the same sessions reflected his new rock and soul fusion in the mid1970s many of his singles found a home on country radio the field where he first became a star363 vocal style and range the general development of presleys voice is described by critic dave marsh as high and thrilled in the early days lower and perplexed in the final months364 marsh credits presley with the introduction of the vocal stutter on 1955s baby lets play house365 when on dont be cruel presley slides into a mmmmm that marks the transition between the first two verses he shows how masterful his relaxed style really is366 marsh describes the singing on cant help falling in love to be of gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing with the line shall i stay pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal367 on the operatic its now or never presley was reaching for something more than he had ever attempted before361 and according to discographer jorgensen later the same year the melody to surrender a number also based on an italian original torna a sorrento required an even greater demonstration of vocal powers368 jorgensen calls the 1966 recording of how great thou art an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions as presley had crafted for himself an adhoc arrangement in which he took every part of the fourpart vocal from the bass intro to the soaring heights of the songs operatic climax in the process becoming a kind of oneman quartet369 guralnick finds stand by me from the same sessions a beautifully articulated almost nakedly yearning performance but by contrast feels that presley reaches beyond his powers on where no one stands alone on which he was reduced to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound that jake hess would have no problem with hess himself thought that while others may have a voice as great or greater than presleys he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime370 guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something the warmth of his voice his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort371 presleys singing to his own necessarily limited both rhythmically and melodically piano accompaniment such as can be heard on the 1967 recording of youll never walk alone for guralnick are always special occasions because it was always a measure of his engagement when he sat down at the keyboard to play372 describing his piano technique as staccato style373 jorgensen finds that on without love from the 1969 sessions his gospelflavored treatment took it to a level of spirituality rarely matched in his career374 presley also played the instrument on the impassioned version of the sessions next song ill hold you in my heart of which guralnick writes that there is something magical about the moment that only the most inspired singing can bring about as elvis loses himself in the music words no longer lend themselves to literal translation and singer and listener both are left emotionally wrung out by the time the song finally limps to an end375 marsh praises his 1968 reading of us male bearing down on the hard guy lyrics not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his sun records376 the performance on in the ghetto is according to jorgensen devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms instead relying on the astonishing clarity and sensitivity of his voice377 guralnick describes the tenderness in the singing of the same song of such unassuming almost translucent eloquence it is so quietly confident in its simplicity that one is reminded of the sun period offering equal parts yearning and social compassion378 on suspicious minds from the same sessions guralnick hears essentially the same remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise but supplemented with an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism at suspected infidelity and anguish over impending loss375 music critic henry pleasants observes that presley has been described variously as a baritone and a tenor an extraordinary compass  and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion379 he identifies presley as a high baritone calculating his range as two octaves and a third from the baritone low g to the tenor high b with an upward extension in falsetto to at least a dflat presleys best octave is in the middle dflat to dflat granting an extra full step up or down379 in pleasants view his voice was variable and unpredictable at the bottom often brilliant at the top with the capacity for fullvoiced high gs and as that an opera baritone might envy379 scholar lindsay waters who figures presleys range as 2¼ octaves emphasizes that his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts grunts grumbles and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender to fear380 presley was always able to duplicate the open hoarse ecstatic screaming shouting wailing reckless sound of the black rhythmandblues and gospel singers writes pleasants and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles379 public image racial issues when dewey phillips first aired thats all right on memphis radio many listeners who contacted the station by phone and telegram to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black67 from the beginning of his national fame presley expressed respect for african american performers and their music and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the south interviewed in 1956 he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician arthur crudup—the originator of thats all right—bang his box the way i do now and i said if i ever got to the place where i could feel all old arthur felt id be a music man like nobody ever saw49 the memphis world an african american newspaper reported that presley the rock n roll phenomenon cracked memphiss segregation laws by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its colored night49 such statements and actions led presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom49 by contrast many white adults according to billboards arnold shaw did not like him and condemned him as depraved antinegro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism regardless of whether parents were aware of the negro sexual origins of the phrase rock n roll presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex381 despite the largely positive view of presley held by african americans a rumor spread in mid1957 that he had at some point announced the only thing negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes a journalist with the national african american weekly jet louie robinson pursued the story on the set of jailhouse rock presley granted robinson an interview though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press he denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view i never said anything like that and people who know me know that i wouldnt have said it a lot of people seem to think i started this business but rock n roll was here a long time before i came along nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people lets face it i cant sing like fats domino can i know that382 also red robinson stated take a look at the things that are only publicized now of how hed be driving down the street and see a destitute black woman with a little child he went and bought her a cadillac now if this guy hated blacks he wouldnt even have gone near them383 robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that presley was anything but racist49384 blues singer ivory joe hunter who had heard the rumor before he visited graceland one evening reported of presley he showed me every courtesy and i think hes one of the greatest385 dudley brooks an africanamerican composer and studio musician who worked with presley during the 1950s and 1960s also disputed allegations that presley was a racist386 though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time it was still being used against presley decades later387 the identification of presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit fight the power by public enemy elvis was a hero to most but he never meant shit to me straightup racist that sucker was simple and plain388 the persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that presley whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to african american sources achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers384 into the 21st century the notion that presley had stolen black music still found adherents387388 notable among african american entertainers expressly rejecting this view was jackie wilson who argued a lot of people have accused elvis of stealing the black mans music when in fact almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from elvis389 and throughout his career presley plainly acknowledged his debt addressing his 68 comeback special audience he said rock n roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues or it sprang from that people have been adding to it adding instruments to it experimenting with it but it all boils down to that nine years earlier he had said rock n roll has been around for many years it used to be called rhythm and blues390 sex symbol poster for the film girls girls girls 1962 visualizing presleys sex symbol image presleys physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged he was once beautiful astonishingly beautiful in the words of critic mark feeney391 television director steve binder no fan of presleys music before he oversaw the 68 comeback special reported im straight as an arrow and i got to tell you you stop whether youre male or female to look at him he was that good looking and if you never knew he was a superstar it wouldnt make any difference if hed walked in the room youd know somebody special was in your presence392 his performance style as much as his physical beauty was responsible for presleys eroticized image writing in 1970 critic george melly described him as the master of the sexual simile treating his guitar as both phallus and girl393 in his presley obituary lester bangs credited him as the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in america394 ed sullivans declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in presleys trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar395 while presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous in 1959 sight and sounds peter john dyer described his onscreen persona as aggressively bisexual in appeal396 brett farmer places the orgasmic gyrations of the title dance sequence in jailhouse rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a spectacular eroticization if not homoeroticization of the male image397 in the analysis of yvonne tasker elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised objectifying version of white workingclass masculinity as aggressive sexual display398 reinforcing presleys image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various hollywood stars and starlets from natalie wood in the 1950s to connie stevens and annmargret in the 1960s to candice bergen and cybill shepherd in the 1970s june juanico of memphis one of presleys early girlfriends later blamed parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind222 presley never grew comfortable with the hollywood scene and most of these relationships were insubstantial399 lifestyle the pink cadillac on display in 2012 presley was known for a life of luxury and excess as exemplified by his estate at graceland he owned a number of expensive cars including three pink cadillacs immortalized in his version of the song baby lets play house in which presley replaced the line you may get religion with you may have a pink cadillac a number of stories both real and exaggerated detail presleys appetite for rich or heavy food he was said to enjoy the southern cuisine of his upbringing including chickenfried steak and biscuits and gravy400 presley is commonly associated with rich sandwiches including the fools gold loaf401 and peanut butter banana and bacon sandwiches400402 now commonly called an elvis sandwich associates colonel parker and the aberbachs further information colonel tom parker presley and colonel tom parker 1969 once he became presleys manager colonel tom parker insisted on exceptionally tight control over his clients career songwriter robert b sherman of the sherman brothers bore witness to the deal being forged between hill and range coowner jean aberbach and the colonel in 1955403 early on the colonel and his hill and range allies the brothers jean and julian aberbach perceived the close relationship that developed between presley and songwriters jerry leiber and mike stoller as a serious threat to that control404 parker effectively ended the relationship deliberately or not with the new contract he sent leiber in early 1958 leiber thought there was a mistake—the sheet of paper was blank except for parkers signature and a line on which to enter his theres no mistake boy just sign it and return it parker directed dont worry well fill it in later leiber declined and presleys fruitful collaboration with the writing team was over405 other respected songwriters lost interest in or simply avoided writing for presley because of the requirement that they surrender a third of their usual royalties406 by 1967 parkers contracts with presley gave him 50 percent of most of the singers earnings from recordings films and merchandise407 beginning in february 1972 he took a third of the profit from live appearances408 a january 1976 agreement entitled him to half of that as well409 priscilla presley noted that elvis detested the business side of his career he would sign a contract without even reading it410 presleys friend marty lacker regarded parker as a hustler and a con artist he was only interested in now money—get the buck and get gone411 parkers personality and reputation often caused problems with business for presley hal wallis is reported to have said id rather try and close a deal with the devil than do any deal with parker sam katzman described parker as the biggest con artist in the world412 gladys presley took a strong dislike to parker from the first time she met him saying that colonel hes the devil himself413 although presley privately described parker to his friends as a lardass bad tempered son of a bitch he never publicly denounced parker414 lacker was instrumental in convincing presley to record with memphis producer chips moman and his handpicked musicians at american sound studio in early 1969 the american sound sessions represented a significant departure from the control customarily exerted by hill and range moman still had to deal with the publishers staff on site whose song suggestions he regarded as unacceptable he was on the verge of quitting until presley ordered the hill and range personnel out of the studio415 although rca executive joan deary was later full of praise for the producers song choices and the quality of the recordings416 moman to his fury received neither credit on the records nor royalties for his work417 since around 1968 presley wanted to make some changes and hoped to do a world tour he remarked before too long im going to make some personal appearance tours ill probably start out here in this country and after that play some concerts abroad probably starting in europe i want to see some places ive never seen before i miss the personal contact with audiences209 however throughout his entire career presley performed in only three venues outside the united states—all of them in canada toronto ottawa and vancouver during brief tours there in 1957418 rumors that he would play overseas for the first time were fueled in 1974 by a milliondollar bid for an australian tour parker was uncharacteristically reluctant prompting those close to presley to speculate about the managers past and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply for a passport419 the real reason why presley never toured abroad was probably because parker feared that if he left the us they would not let him back in again as it was later revealed that parker was an illegal immigrant born andreas cornelis van kuijk in the netherlands who left to go to the us at the age of 29420 parker ultimately squelched any notions presley had of working abroad claiming that foreign security was poor and the venues unsuitable for a star of his magnitude421 parker arguably exercised tightest control over presleys film career in 1957 robert mitchum asked presley to costar with him in thunder road on which mitchum was writer and producer422 according to george klein one of his oldest friends presley was offered starring roles in west side story and midnight cowboy423 in 1974 barbra streisand approached presley to star with her in the remake of a star is born424 in each case any ambitions the singer may have had to play such parts were thwarted by his managers negotiating demands or flat refusals in lackers description the only thing that kept elvis going after the early years was a new challenge but parker kept running everything into the ground411 the prevailing attitude may have been summed up best by the response leiber and stoller received when they brought a serious film project for presley to parker and the hill and range owners for their consideration in leibers telling jean aberbach warned them to never again try to interfere with the business or artistic workings of the process known as elvis presley192 memphis mafia main article memphis mafia in the early 1960s the circle of friends with whom presley constantly surrounded himself until his death came to be known as the memphis mafia425 surrounded by their parasitic presence as journalist john harris puts it it was no wonder that as he slid into addiction and torpor noone raised the alarm to them elvis was the bank and it had to remain open426 tony brown who played piano for presley regularly in the last two years of the singers life observed his rapidly declining health and the urgent need to address it but we all knew it was hopeless because elvis was surrounded by that little circle of people  all those socalled friends427 in the memphis mafias defense marty lacker has said presley was his own man  if we hadnt been around he would have been dead a lot earlier428 larry geller became presleys hairdresser in 1964 unlike others in the memphis mafia he was interested in spiritual questions and recalls how from their first conversation presley revealed his secret thoughts and anxieties i mean there has to be a purpose  theres got to be a reason  why i was chosen to be elvis presley  i swear to god no one knows how lonely i get and how empty i really feel429 thereafter geller supplied him with books on religion and mysticism which the singer read voraciously430 presley would be preoccupied by such matters for much of his life taking trunkloads of books with him on tour259 legacy further information cultural impact of elvis presley cultural depictions of elvis presley elvis has left the building and list of songs about or referencing elvis presley i know he invented rock and roll in a manner of speaking but  thats not why hes worshiped as a god today hes worshiped as a god today because in addition to inventing rock and roll he was the greatest ballad singer this side of frank sinatra—because the spiritual translucence and reinedin gut sexuality of his slow weeper and torchy pop blues still activate the hormones and slavish devotion of millions of female human beings worldwide —robert christgau december 24 1985431 presleys rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture432 as the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude433 with its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by presley—rock and rolls occupation of a central position in mainstream american culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture434 in this regard little richard said of presley he was an integrator elvis was a blessing they wouldnt let black music through he opened the door for black music435 al green agreed he broke the ice for all of us436 president jimmy carter remarked on his legacy in 1977 his music and his personality fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues permanently changed the face of american popular culture his following was immense and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality rebelliousness and good humor of his country299 presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication at the age of 21 within a year of his first appearance on american network television he was one of the most famous people in the world437 john lennon stated that before elvis there was nothing 438 lennon also said that nothing really affected me until i heard elvis if there hadnt been an elvis there wouldnt have been the beatles439 presleys name image and voice are instantly recognizable around the globe440 he has inspired a legion of impersonators441 in polls and surveys he is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential americanse elvis presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century said composer and conductor leonard bernstein he introduced the beat to everything and he changed everything—music language clothes its a whole new social revolution—the sixties came from it449 bob dylan described the sensation of first hearing presley as like busting out of jail436 on the 25th anniversary of presleys death the new york times observed all the talentless impersonators and appalling black velvet paintings on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory but before elvis was camp he was its opposite a genuine cultural force  elviss breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rockandroll age his hardrocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely450 not only presleys achievements but his failings as well are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy as in this description by greil marcus presleys star on the hollywood walk of fame at 6777 hollywood blvd elvis presley is a supreme figure in american life one whose presence no matter how banal or predictable brooks no real comparisons  the cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day but also patriotic recitals pure country gospel and really dirty blues  elvis has emerged as a great artist a great rocker a great purveyor of schlock a great heart throb a great bore a great symbol of potency a great ham a great nice person and yes a great american451 discography main articles

bestselling music artists personal relationships of elvis presley notes although some pronounce his surname prɛzli prezlee presley himself used the southern american english pronunciation prɛsli preslee as did his family and those who worked with him1 the correct spelling of his middle name has long been a matter of debate the physician who delivered him wrote elvis aaron presley in his ledger2 the stateissued birth certificate reads elvis aron presley the name was chosen after the presleys friend and fellow congregation member aaron kennedy though a singlea spelling was probably intended by presleys parents in order to parallel the middle name of presleys stillborn brother jesse garon3 it reads aron on most official documents produced during his lifetime including his high school diploma rca record contract and marriage license and this was generally taken to be the proper spelling4 in 1966 presley expressed the desire to his father that the more traditional biblical rendering aaron be used henceforth especially on legal documents2 five years later the jaycees citation honoring him as one of the countrys outstanding young men used aaron late in his life he sought to officially change the spelling to aaron and discovered that state records already listed it that way knowing his wishes for his middle name aaron is the spelling his father chose for presleys tombstone and it is the spelling his estate has designated as official4 of the 40000 5000 covered back royalties owed by sun89 in 1956–57 presley was also credited as a cowriter on several songs where he had no hand in the writing process heartbreak hotel dont be cruel all four songs from his first film including the title track love me tender paralyzed and all shook up92 parker however failed to register presley with such musical licensing firms as ascap andor its rival bmi which eventually denied presley annuity from songwriters royalties he received credit on two other songs to which he did contribute he provided the title for thats someone you never forget 1961 written by his friend and former humes schoolmate red west presley and west collaborated with another friend guitarist charlie
