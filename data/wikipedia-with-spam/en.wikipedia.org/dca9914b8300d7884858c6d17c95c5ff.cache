bibliography 13 external links history main article history of the fifa world cup previous international competitions the worlds first international football match was a challenge match played in glasgow in 1872 between scotland and england5 which ended in a 0–0 draw the first international tournament the inaugural edition of the british home championship took place in 18846 as football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the turn of the 20th century it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 summer olympics however the ioc has retroactively upgraded their status to official events and at the 1906 intercalated games7 after fifa was founded in 1904 it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the olympic framework in switzerland in 1906 these were very early days for international football and the official history of fifa describes the competition as having been a failure8 at the 1908 summer olympics in london football became an official competition planned by the football association fa englands football governing body the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition great britain represented by the england national amateur football team won the gold medals they repeated the feat in 1912 in stockholm with the olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams sir thomas lipton organised the sir thomas lipton trophy tournament in turin in 1909 the lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs not national teams from different nations each one of which represented an entire nation the competition is sometimes described as the first world cup9 and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from italy germany and switzerland but the fa of england refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team lipton invited west auckland an amateur side from county durham to represent england instead west auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title in 1914 fifa agreed to recognise the olympic tournament as a world football championship for amateurs and took responsibility for managing the event10 this paved the way for the worlds first intercontinental football competition at the 1920 summer olympics contested by egypt and 13 european teams and won by belgium11 uruguay won the next two olympic football tournaments in 1924 and 1928 those were also the first two open world championships as 1924 was the start of fifas professional era world cups before world war ii estadio centenario the location of the first world cup final in 1930 in montevideo uruguay due to the success of the olympic football tournaments fifa with president jules rimet as the driving force again started looking at staging its own international tournament outside of the olympics on 28 may 1928 the fifa congress in amsterdam decided to stage a world championship itself12 with uruguay now twotime official football world champions and to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930 fifa named uruguay as the host country of the inaugural world cup tournament the national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team but the choice of uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the atlantic ocean for european sides indeed no european country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition rimet eventually persuaded teams from belgium france romania and yugoslavia to make the trip in total 13 nations took part seven from south america four from europe and two from north america the first two world cup matches took place simultaneously on 13 july 1930 and were won by france and the usa who defeated mexico 4–1 and belgium 3–0 respectively the first goal in world cup history was scored by lucien laurent of france13 in the final uruguay defeated argentina 4–2 in front of a crowd of 93000 people in montevideo and in doing so became the first nation to win the world cup14 after the creation of the world cup fifa and the ioc disagreed over the status of amateur players and so football was dropped from the 1932 summer olympics15 olympic football returned at the 1936 summer olympics but was now overshadowed by the more prestigious world cup the issues facing the early world cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel and war few south american teams were willing to travel to europe for the 1934 and 1938 tournaments with brazil the only south american team to compete in both the 1942 and 1946 competitions which nazi germany and brazil sought to host16 were cancelled due to world war ii and its aftermath world cups after world war ii the 1950 world cup held in brazil was the first to include british participants british teams withdrew from fifa in 1920 partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with and partly as a protest against foreign influence on football17 but rejoined in 1946 following fifas invitation18 the tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions uruguay who had boycotted the previous two world cups uruguay won the tournament again after defeating the host nation brazil in the match called maracanazo portuguese maracanaço in the tournaments between 1934 and 1978 16 teams competed in each tournament except in 1938 when austria was absorbed into germany after qualifying leaving the tournament with 15 teams and in 1950 when india scotland and turkey withdrew leaving the tournament with 13 teams19 most of the participating nations were from europe and south america with a small minority from north america africa asia and oceania these teams were usually defeated easily by the european and south american teams until 1982 the only teams from outside europe and south america to advance out of the first round were usa semifinalists in 1930 cuba quarterfinalists in 1938 north korea quarterfinalists in 1966 and mexico quarterfinalists in 1970 expansion to 32 teams the tournament was expanded to 24 teams in 198220 and then to 32 in 199821 also allowing more teams from africa asia and north america to take part since then teams from these regions have enjoyed more success with several having reached the quarterfinals mexico quarterfinalists in 1986 cameroon quarterfinalists in 1990 south korea finishing in fourth place in 2002 senegal along with usa both quarterfinalists in 2002 ghana quarterfinalists in 2010 and costa rica quarterfinalists in 2014 nevertheless european and south american teams continue to dominate eg the quarterfinalists in 1994 1998 and 2006 were all from europe or south america and so were the finalists of all tournaments so far two hundred teams entered the 2002 fifa world cup qualification rounds 198 nations attempted to qualify for the 2006 fifa world cup while a record 204 countries entered qualification for the 2010 fifa world cup22 expansion to 48 teams in october 2013 sepp blatter spoke of guaranteeing the caribbean football unions region a position in the world cup23 in the 25 october 2013 edition of the fifa weekly blatter wrote that from a purely sporting perspective i would like to see globalisation finally taken seriously and the african and asian national associations accorded the status they deserve at the fifa world cup it cannot be that the european and south american confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the world cup24 those two remarks suggested to commentators that blatter could be putting himself forward for reelection to the fifa presidency25 following the magazines publication blatters wouldbe opponent for the fifa presidency uefa president michel platini responded that he intended to extend the world cup to 40 national associations increasing the number of participants by eight platini said that he would allocate an additional berth to uefa two to asia football confederation and confederation of african football two shared between concacaf and conmebol and a guaranteed place for the oceania football confederation26 platini was clear about why he wanted to expand the world cup he said the world cup is not based on the quality of the teams because you dont have the best 32 at the world cup  but its a good compromise  its a political matter so why not have more africans the competition is to bring all the people of all the world if you dont give the possibility to participate they dont improve26 in october 2016 fifa president gianni infantino stated his support for a 48team world cup in 202627 on 10 january 2017 fifa confirmed the 2026 world cup will have 48 finalist teams28 2015 fifa corruption case main article 2015 fifa corruption case by may 2015 the games were under a particularly dark cloud because of the 2015 fifa corruption case allegations and criminal charges of bribery fraud and money laundering to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights rigged bids for fifa games29 with fifa officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than 150 million over 24 years in late may the us justice department announced a 47count indictment with charges of racketeering wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy against 14 people arrests of over a dozen fifa officials were made since that time particularly on may 29 and december 330 by the end of may 2015 a total of nine fifa officials and five executives of sports and broadcasting markets had already been charged on corruption at the time fifa president sepp blatter announced he would relinquish his position in february 201631 on 4 june 2015 chuck blazer while cooperating with the fbi and the swiss authorities admitted that he and the other members of fifas thenexecutive committee were bribed in order to promote the 1998 and 2010 world cups32 on 10 june 2015 swiss authorities seized computer data from the offices of sepp blatter33 the same day fifa postponed the bidding process for the 2026 fifa world cup in light of the allegations surrounding bribery in the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments thensecretary general jérôme valcke stated due to the situation i think its nonsense to start any bidding process for the time being34 on 28 october 2015 blatter and fifa vp michel platini a potential candidate for presidency were suspended for 90 days both maintained their innocence in statements made to the news media35 on 3 december 2015 two fifa vicepresidents were arrested on suspicion of bribery in the same zurich hotel where seven fifa officials had been arrested in may36 an additional 16 indictments by the us department of justice were announced on the same day37 other fifa tournaments an equivalent tournament for womens football the fifa womens world cup was first held in 1991 in china38 the womens tournament is smaller in scale and profile than the mens but is growing the number of entrants for the 2007 tournament was 120 more than double that of 199139 mens football has been included in every summer olympic games except 1896 and 1932 unlike many other sports the mens football tournament at the olympics is not a toplevel tournament and since 1992 an under23 tournament with each team allowed three overage players40 womens football made its olympic debut in 1996 the fifa confederations cup is a tournament held one year before the world cup at the world cup host nations as a dress rehearsal for the upcoming world cup it is contested by the winners of each of the six fifa confederation championships along with the fifa world cup champion and the host country41 fifa also organises international tournaments for youth football fifa u20 world cup fifa u17 world cup fifa u20 womens world cup fifa u17 womens world cup club football fifa club world cup and football variants such as futsal fifa futsal world cup and beach soccer fifa beach soccer world cup the latter three do not have a womens version although a fifa womens club world cup has been proposed42 the fifa u20 womens world cup is held the year before each womens world cup and both tournaments are awarded in a single bidding process the u20 tournament serves as a dress rehearsal for the larger competition43 trophy main article fifa world cup trophy from 1930 to 1970 the jules rimet trophy was awarded to the world cup winning team it was originally simply known as the world cup or coupe du monde but in 1946 it was renamed after the fifa president jules rimet who set up the first tournament in 1970 brazils third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently however the trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered apparently melted down by the thieves44 after 1970 a new trophy known as the fifa world cup trophy was designed the experts of fifa coming from seven countries evaluated the 53 presented models finally opting for the work of the italian designer silvio gazzaniga the new trophy is 36 cm 142 in high made of solid 18 carat 75 gold and weighs 6175 kg 136 lb the base contains two layers of semiprecious malachite while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each fifa world cup winner since 1974 the description of the trophy by gazzaniga was the lines spring out from the base rising in spirals stretching out to receive the world from the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory45 this new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently world cup winners retain the trophy only until the postmatch celebration is finished they are awarded a goldplated replica rather than the solid gold original immediately afterwards46 currently all members players coaches and managers of the top three teams receive medals with an insignia of the world cup trophy winners gold runnersup silver and thirdplace bronze in the 2002 edition fourthplace medals were awarded to hosts south korea before the 1978 tournament medals were only awarded to the eleven players on the pitch at the end of the final and the thirdplace match in november 2007 fifa announced that all members of world cupwinning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners medals474849 format qualification main article fifa world cup qualification since the second world cup in 1934 qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament50 they are held within the six fifa continental zones africa asia north and central america and caribbean south america oceania and europe overseen by their respective confederations for each tournament fifa decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand generally based on the relative strength of the confederations teams the qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a twoyear period the formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations usually one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental playoffs for example the winner of the oceanian zone and the fifthplaced team from the asian zone entered a playoff for a spot in the 2010 world cup51 from the 1938 world cup onwards host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament this right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002 but was withdrawn from the 2006 fifa world cup onward requiring the champions to qualify brazil winners in 2002 were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches52 final tournament for the various formats used in previous tournaments see history of the fifa world cup § format of each final tournament the current final tournament has been used since 1998 and features 32 national teams competing over the course of a month in the host nations there are two stages the group stage followed by the knockout stage53 in the group stage teams compete within eight groups of four teams each eight teams are seeded including the hosts with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the fifa world rankings andor performances in recent world cups and drawn to separate groups54 the other teams are assigned to different pots usually based on geographical criteria and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups since 1998 constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two european teams or more than one team from any other confederation55 each group plays a roundrobin tournament in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group this means that a total of six matches are played within a group the last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams56 the top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage points are used to rank the teams within a group since 1994 three points have been awarded for a win one for a draw and none for a loss before winners received two points if one considers all possible outcomes win draw loss for all six matches in a group there are 729 36 different outcome combinations possible however a certain number 207 of these combinations lead to ties between the second and third places in such case the ranking among these teams is determined as follows57 greatest combined goal difference in all group matches greatest combined number of goals scored in all group matches if more than one team remain level after applying the above criteria their ranking will be determined as follows greatest number of points in headtohead matches among those teams greatest goal difference in headtohead matches among those teams greatest number of goals scored in headtohead matches among those teams if any of the teams above remain level after applying the above criteria their ranking will be determined by the drawing of lots the knockout stage is a singleelimination tournament in which teams play each other in oneoff matches with extra time and penalty shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary it begins with the round of 16 or the second round in which the winner of each group plays against the runnerup of another group this is followed by the quarterfinals the semifinals the thirdplace match contested by the losing semifinalists and the final53 on 10 january 2017 fifa approved a new format the 48team world cup to accommodate more teams which consists of 16 groups of three teams each with two teams qualifying from each group to form a round of 32 knockout stage to be implemented by 202658 hosts main article fifa world cup hosts map of fifa world cup final hosts 1930–2022 green once dark green twice light green planned selection process early world cups were given to countries at meetings of fifas congress the locations were controversial because south america and europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat the decision to hold the first world cup in uruguay for example led to only four european nations competing59 the next two world cups were both held in europe the decision to hold the second of these in france was disputed as the south american countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents both argentina and uruguay thus boycotted the 1938 fifa world cup60 russian delegates celebrate being chosen as the host of the 2018 fifa world cup since the 1958 fifa world cup to avoid future boycotts or controversy fifa began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the americas and europe which continued until the 1998 fifa world cup the 2002 fifa world cup hosted jointly by south korea and japan was the first one held in asia and the only tournament with multiple hosts61 south africa became the first african nation to host the world cup in 2010 the 2014 fifa world cup was hosted by brazil the first held in south america since argentina 197862 and was the first occasion where consecutive world cups were held outside europe the host country is now chosen in a vote by fifas council this is done under an exhaustive ballot system the national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a hosting agreement from fifa which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid the bidding association also receives a form the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy after this a fifa designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced the decision on who will host the world cup is usually made six or seven years in advance of the tournament however there have been occasions where the hosts of multiple future tournaments were announced at the same time as was the case for the 2018 and 2022 world cups which were awarded to russia and qatar with qatar becoming the first middle eastern country to host the tournament6364 for the 2010 and 2014 world cups the final tournament is rotated between confederations allowing only countries from the chosen confederation africa in 2010 south america in 2014 to bid to host the tournament the rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding germanys victory over south africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament however the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014 so any country except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments can apply as hosts for world cups starting from 201865 this is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament where brazil was

top ranked teams against each other with uruguays 2–1 victory over brazil thus often being considered as the de facto final of the 1950 world cup74 likewise the game between the lowest ranked teams
