he owned or operated 84 theatres across the united states and canada he was known as a tireless operator and a particularly ruthless one in 1929 he was accused of raping a native 17yearold dancer named eunice alice pringle the negative publicity led to the selling of his operations and he ceased to be a force in exhibition or vaudeville ever again despite his pioneering spirit and promoting of

his year of birth but it is likely that he was born in 18671 on the island of andros greece it is suggested that he was born pericles pantages but changed it to alexander when he heard about alexander the great2 in a personal correspondence between rodney pantages son of alexander and arthur dean tarrach pantages biographer this claim is denied3 at the age of nine he ran away while with his father on a business trip in cairo egypt he then went to sea and spent the next two years working as a deck hand he arrived in the united states in the early 1880s his ties to his homeland seem mercurial he never set foot on greece again although he did assist his relatives financially and even brought his brother nicholas to live in the united states he used to call himself king greek perhaps in emulation of louis b mayers super jew4 after having been at sea for two years he disembarked in panama and spent some time there helping the french to dig the panama canal but after contracting malaria he was warned by a doctor to move to cooler climates he headed north stopping briefly in seattle but eventually settling in san francisco where he worked as a waiter and also briefly and unsuccessfully as a boxer he left san francisco in 1897 and made his way to canadas yukon territory during the klondike gold rush ending up in the mining boomtown of dawson city in his time in the bitter cold of dawson city he worked as a waiter and janitor but always restless and allergic to manual labor he became business partner and lover to the saloon dancer and brothelkeeper klondike kate rockwell operating a small but successful vaudeville and burlesque theatre the orpheumcitation needed starting exhibitionedit pantages house in seattle built 1907 now a city landmark in 1902 pantages left dawson and moved to seattle washington where he opened the crystal theater a shortform vaudeville and motion picture house of his own he ran the operation almost entirely by himself and charged 10 cents admission5 this took place a few months after rockwell had opened up a small storefront movie theater in vancouver and later built a theater there in 1907 that stood until 2011 and another in 19146 that same year he married a musician named lois mendenhall c1870–19417 klondike kate filed a breachofpromisetomarry lawsuit against him settled out of court and later wrote that he had stolen from her the money with which he purchased the crystal it would be more than two decades before they saw each other againcitation needed in 1904 pantages opened a second seattle theatre the pantages in 1906 he added a stock theater the lois named after his wife5 by 1920 he owned more than 30 vaudeville theatres and controlled through management contracts perhaps 60 morecitation needed in both the united states and canada these theatres formed the pantages circuit a chain of theatres into which he could book and rotate touring acts on longterm contracts in seattle pantages competed with another impresario john considine their competition included such clandestine methods as stealing acts from each other and committing various forms of sabotage this competition lasted for several decades and was one of the defining features of the vaudeville circuit of the timescitation needed pantages theatre circuitedit his theatres were elegant and efficiently operatedcitation needed he showcased both film and live vaudeville to his audiences despite initial refusal to allow africanamericans into his theatres he eventually yielded after being successfully sued by an africanamerican who had been refused entry into a pantages theater in spokane washington8 the starting point of the pantages circuit was the city of winnipeg manitoba where pantages built the pantages playhouse in 1914 all pantages tours originated in winnipeg and moved from there around the circuit of theatres while the majority of the theatres were owned by others and managed by pantages he became from 1911 on a builder of theatres all over the western us and canada his favoured architect in these ventures was b marcus priteca 1881–1971 of seattle who regularly worked with muralist anthony heinsbergen priteca devised an exotic neoclassical style that his employer called pantages greekcitation needed pantages often sought out and judged performers personally instead of relying on new york agents like many of his competitors didcitation needed a ruthless but intensely hardworking businessman pantages invested his theatrical profits into new outlets and eventually moved to los angeles his showcase theatre at 7th and hill street in downtown la also housed his offices entering movielandedit around 1920 pantages entered into partnership with the motion picture distributor famous players a subsidiary of film producer paramount pictures and further expanded his combo houses designed to exhibit films as well as staging live vaudeville to new sites in western us throughout the 1920s the pantages circuit dominated the vaudeville and motion picture market in north america west of the mississippi rivercitation needed pantages was effectively blocked from expansion into the eastern market by new yorkbased keithalbeeorpheum kao in the late 1920s with the looming advent of talking pictures david sarnoff the principal of the radio corporation of america rca which held a number of patents in filmsound technology established the film production company radio pictures in which joseph p kennedy held an option and a managing interest moved to acquire control of the kao theatres through quiet purchases of the companys stock in 1927 kennedy and sarnoff were successful in gaining control of kao and in 1928 changed the name of the company to radio keith orpheum rko they then approached alexander pantages with an offer to purchase his entire chain pantages rejected the offer rape trialedit in the midst of the wall street crash of 1929 alexander pantages was arrested and charged with the rape of 17yearold californiaborn eunice pringle pringle an aspiring vaudeville dancer alleged that pantages had attacked her in a small sideoffice of his downtown theater after she came to see him to discuss her audition newspaper coverage of the trial particularly by william randolph hearsts los angeles examiner was strongly antagonistic towards the greekaccented pantages while portraying pringle as the innocent victim in countless stories in the examiner from the moment the case broke in the newspaper on saturday august 10 1929 until the end of the trial pantages was portrayed as variously alone aloof cold emotionless effete and european while the native pringle was victimized through portraits with her family emotional outbursts in court and lengthy interviews in the press and always with a sense of decorum and empathy pantages granted no interviews during the trial9 he did however run into kate rockwell in the hallway outside the court one day and they briefly exchanged greetings she had been brought by the prosecution to court to testify against him which she never did it surprised few that on october 27 1929 pantages was convicted and sentenced to 50 years in prison despite his claim that he was set up the verdict came as a surprise to pantages who had hired very expensive new york lawyers to defend him and was subsequently jailed for several months despite the verdict against him pantages was successful in fending off a civil suit brought against him by pringle pantages then engaged attorney jerry giesler later to become famous as a divorce lawyer and san francisco lawyer jake ehrlich to file an appeal on his behalf geisler successfully petitioned for a new trial with the california supreme court basing his argument on the original trial judges exclusion of testimony relating to eunice pringles moral character10 pantages was acquitted in the second trial in 1931 after geisler portrayed pringle as a woman of low morals he also demonstrated how impractical a rape would have been in pantages broom closet and asked the court why the athletic acrobatic pringle – if the rape allegations were true – did not fight off the 5 65 126 lbs 62yearold pantages11 the jury agreed and dismissed the case posttrial yearsedit although pantages was acquitted the trials ruined him financially he sold the theatre chain to rko for a lower sum than that originally offered – far less than what his pantages greek vaudeville palaces had cost him to build – and went into retirementcitation needed he owned and raced horses pantages died in 1936 and was interred in the great mausoleum sanctuary of benediction at forest lawn memorial park in glendale california the rumour begun at the second trial that rko and kennedy paid eunice pringle to frame alexander pantages was revived in ronald kesslers biography of joseph kennedy the sins of the father joseph p kennedy and the dynasty he founded new york warner books 1997 more than a rumour it also plays a prominent role in hollywood and the mob by tim adler who writes convincingly about the dubious role of joseph kennedy in the rape story see alsoedit biography portal john
