worst avalanche measured in terms of lives lost in the history of the united states2 for nine days at the end of february 1910 wellington was assailed by a terrible blizzard up to a foot 30 cm of snow fell every hour and on the worst day eleven feet 340 cm of snow fell two trains a passenger train and a mail train both bound from spokane to seattle were trapped in the depot3 snow plows were present at wellington and others were sent to help but they could not penetrate the snow accumulations and repeated avalanches along the stretch of tracks between scenic and leavenworth late on february 28 the snow stopped and was replaced by rain and a warm wind just after 1 am on march 1 as a result of a lightning strike a slab of snow broke loose from the side of windy mountain during a violent thunderstorm a tenfoot high mass of snow half a mile long and a quarter of a mile wide fell toward the town a forest fire had recently ravaged the slopes above the town leaving very little to impede the avalanche the avalanche missed the bailets hotel which also housed the towns general store and post office but hit the railroad depot most of the passengers and crew were asleep aboard their trains the impact threw the trains 150 feet 45 m downhill and into the tye river valley ninety six people were killed including 35 passengers 58 great northern employees on the trains and three railroad employees in the depot3 twentythree people survived they were pulled from the wreckage by railroad employees who immediately rushed from the hotel and other buildings where they had been staying however the work was then abandoned because of the adverse weather conditions and it was not until 21 weeks later during late july that the last of the bodies were retrieved this was not the only avalanche in the region that winter three days later 63 railroad workers were killed in an avalanche nearby in british columbia aftermathedit wellington was quietly renamed tye during october because of the unpleasant associations of the old name in the same month the great northern railway began construction of concrete snow sheds to shelter the nearby tracks the depot was closed when the second cascade tunnel was completed in 1929 the town was then abandoned and it eventually burned the old track and snow sheds remain and have been preserved as part of the iron goat trail2 which is accessible easily from us highway 2 near stevens pass or near scenic east of everett this ghost town went on to have an elementary school built and named after it wellington elementary is an
