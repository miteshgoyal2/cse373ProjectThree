analyzes and organizes images into groups and can identify features such as beaches skylines or snowstorm in toronto3 from the applications search window users are shown potential searches for groups of photos in three major categories people places and things1 the service analyzes photos for similar faces and groups them together in the people category1 it can also track faces as they age3 the places category uses geotagging data but can also determine locations in older pictures by analyzing for major landmarks eg photos containing the eiffel tower1 the things category processes photos for their subject matter birthdays buildings cats concerts food graduations posters screenshots etc users can manually remove categorization errors1 recipients of shared images can view web galleries without needing to download the app3 users can swipe their fingers across the screen to adjust the services photo editing settings as opposed to using sliders4 images can be easily shared with social networks google facebook twitter and other services the application generates web links that both google photos users and nonusers can access1 updatesedit in december 2015 google added shared albums to google photos users pool photos and videos into an album and then share the album with other google photos users the recipient can join to add their own photos and videos and also get notifications when new pics are added users can also save photos and videos from shared albums to add them to their own private collection567 in march 2016 google updated photos to include automatically generated albums after an event or trip photos will group the best photos together and suggest creating an album with them alongside maps to show geographic travel and location pins for exact places users can also add text captions to describe photos89 in october google announced multiple significant updates google photos will now surface old memories with people identified in users recent photos it will occasionally highlight the best photos when a user has recently taken a lot of images of a specific subject it will now make animations from videos as well as photos photo animations have been present since the start displaying the most memorable moments in videos and it will now find all sideways photos and help the user easily flip them to normal orientation for all of these features google touts machine learning does the work with no user interaction required10 in november google released a separate app photoscan for users to scan printed photos into the service the app released for ios and android uses a scanning process in which users must center their camera over four dots that overlay the printed image so that the software can combine the photographs for a high resolution digital image with fewest possible defects1112 later that month google added a deep blue slider feature that lets users change the color and saturation of skies without degrading image quality or inadvertently changing colors of other objects or elements in photos13 in february 2017 google updated the albums tab on the android app to include three separate sections one for the phones camera roll with different views for sorting options such as people or location another for photos taken inside other apps and a third for the actual photo albums1415 in march google added an automatic white balance feature to the service the android app and website were the first to receive the feature with later rollout to the ios app1617 later in march updates to the service enabled uploading of photos in a lightweight preview quality for immediate viewing on slow cellular networks before a higherquality upload later while on faster wifi the feature also extends to sharing photos in which a lowresolution image will be sent before being updated with a higherquality version1819 in april google added video stabilization the feature creates a duplicate video to avoid overwriting the original clip2021 in may 2017 google announced several updates to google photos suggested sharing reminds users to share captured photos after the fact and also groups photos based on faces and suggests recipients based on facial recognition shared libraries lets two users share a central repository for all photos or specific categories of images photo books are physical collections of photos offered either as softcover or hardcover albums with photos automatically suggesting collections based on face location trip or other distinction222324 towards the end of the month google introduced an archive feature that lets users hide photos from the main timeline view without deleting them archived content still appears in relevant albums and in search2526 in june the new sharing features announced in may began rolling out to users2728 historyedit google photos is the standalone successor to the photo features previously embedded within google the companys social network3 google launched the social network to compete with facebook but the service never became as popular and facebook remained the internets preferred website for social networking and photo sharing google however offered photo storage and organizational tools that surpassed facebooks in power though google lacked the user base to use it4 by leaving the social network affiliation the photos service changed its association from a sharing platform to a private library platform1 on february 12 2016 google announced that the picasa desktop application would be discontinued on march 15 2016 followed by the closure of the picasa web albums service on may 1 2016 google stated that the primary reason for retiring picasa was that it wanted to focus its efforts entirely on a single photo service the crossplatform webbased google photos29 growthedit in october 2015 five months after the launch of the service google announced that google photos had 100 million users who had uploaded 372 petabytes of photos and videos303132 in may 2016 one year after the release of google photos google announced the service had over 200 million monthly active users other statistics it revealed was at least 137 petabytes of photosvideos had been uploaded 2 trillion labels had been applied 24 billion of those being selfies and 16 billion animations collages and effects had been created based on user content33 in may 2017 google announced that google photos has over 500 million users34 who upload over 12 billion photos every day35 receptionedit at the may 2015 release of google photos reviewers wrote that the service was among the best of its kind136 walt mossberg of recode declared the service the best in cloud photo storage against its competition from amazon amazon drive apple icloud dropbox and microsoft onedrive1 jacob kastrenakes of the verge wrote that the release made google a major competitor in the photo storage market3 and that its pricing structure obsoleted the idea of paying for photo storage4 sarah mitroff and lynn la of cnet wrote that the services phone and tablet apps were particularly good and that google photos had a more streamlined design than yahoos flickr and more organizing features than apples icloud photo service36 kastrenakes described the services may 2015 release as evidence that google was spinning out the best features of its google social network he stated that the photos service was always excellent and liked that users would be able to use the service without signing up for a new social network3 mossberg described the release as liberation day for the photos features that were effectively hidden in the widely ignored social network1 the services strategy as described by josh lowensohn of the verge was to put all data on googles servers so that it can be accessed universally4 mossberg liked the services search function writing that a search for massachusetts instantly brought up loads of photos of subjects1 lowensohn noted the services speed and intelligence especially in its ability to sort unorganized photos as well as its photo loading times search speeds and simple photo editing tools4 kastrenakes compared the services new image analysis to technology unveiled by flickr earlier in the same month3 mossberg thought the face grouping feature was remarkably accurate but was most impressed by the subjectbased grouping he was surprised that a search for boats found both cape cod fishing boats and venetian gondolas but also noted errors such as a professional photograph registering as a screenshot1 pc magazines john c dvorak was concerned about the services privacy he was particularly concerned about googles motivation for building the service the companys relationships with existing governments and potential laws that would require google to provide a users entire history of photos upon request dvorak compared such a scenario to inviting others to scrounge through your underwear drawer he criticized the services sync functions and preferred folders of images over an unsorted flat database dvorak also highlighted the services poor choice of photos to animate and lack of longevity guarantees considering the companys abrupt cancellation of google reader he ultimately suggested that users instead use a portable hard drive which he considered safer and less expensive37 in june 2015 jacky alcine a 21yearold african american programmer noticed the new google photos app had filed a number of photos of him and his black friend in an automatically generated album named gorillas after reporting google removed the controversial gorilla tag from the app and made an apology3839 referencesedit a b c d e f g h i j k l m mossberg walt june 2 2015 the new google photos free at last
