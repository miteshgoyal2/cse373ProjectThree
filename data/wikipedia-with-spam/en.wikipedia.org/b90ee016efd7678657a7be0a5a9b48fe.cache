cei promotes environmental policies based on limited government regulation and property rights and rejects what they call global warming alarmism3 the organizations largest program the center for energy and environment focuses on energy policy chemical risk policy clean air act regulation land and water regulation the endangered species act and private conservation policies cei is an outspoken opponent of government action by the environmental protection agency that would require limits on greenhouse gas emissions it favors freemarket environmentalism and supports the idea that market institutions are more effective in protecting the environment than is government cei president kent lassman wrote on the organizations blog that there is no debate about whether the earth’s climate is warming that human activities very likely contribute to that warming and that this has long been the cei’s position in march 1992 ceis founder fred smith said of anthropogenic climate change most of the indications right now are it looks pretty good warmer winters warmer nights no effects during the day because of clouding sounds to me like were moving to a more benign planet more rain richer easier productivity to agriculture4 in may 2006 ceis global warming policy activities attracted attention as it embarked upon an ad campaign with two television commercials5 these ads promote carbon dioxide as a positive factor in the environment and argue that global warming is not a concern one ad focuses on the message that co2 is misrepresented as a pollutant stating that its essential to life we breathe it out plants breathe it in they call it pollution we call it life6 the other states that the worlds glaciers are growing not melting getting thicker not thinner6 it cites science articles to support its claims however the editor of science stated that the ad misrepresents the conclusions of the two cited science papers by selective referencing the author of the articles curt davis director of the center for geospatial intelligence at the university of missouricolumbia said cei was misrepresenting his previous research to inflate their claims these television ads are a deliberate effort to confuse and mislead the public about the global warming debate davis said7 in 2009 ceis director of energy and global warming policy told the washington post the only thing thats been demonstrated to reduce emissions is economic collapse8 in 2014 cei sued the white house office of science and technology policy over a video that linked the polar vortex to climate change9 legal advocacyedit the cei is one of a small number of think tanks that have a litigation arm to their organization10 challenges to the affordable care actedit cei funded and coordinated king v burwell and halbig v burwell two lawsuits that challenged the internal revenue services implementation of the affordable care act11 the strategy of bringing such lawsuits was pioneered by michael s greve former chairman of ceis board of directors an avowed aca opponent who stated this bastard the act has to be killed as a matter of political hygiene i do not care how this is done whether it’s dismembered whether we drive a stake through its heart whether we tar and feather it and drive it out of town whether we strangle it1213 the king v burwell suit alleged that the irss implementation violated the statute and sought to block a major portion of obamacare the subsidies that more than 6 million middleincome people across more than 30 states now receive to buy health insurance11 cei general counsel sam kazman argued in a usa today oped that the disputed irs rule raises a basic issue that goes far beyond obamacare do agencies have to follow the laws enacted by congress or can they rewrite them14 the case made its way to the supreme court which in a 63 decision rejected the challenge and upheld the aca subsidies11 challenges to the doddfrank act and financial regulationedit in 2012 the cei along with the conservative activist group 60 plus association filed a lawsuit against the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb the ceis suit alleges that the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection acts creation of the cfpb violates the constitutional separation of powers1015 the cei also contends that president obamas recess appointment of richard cordray as cfpb director was unconstitutional1016 and that the powers of the financial stability oversight council created by doddfrank are unconstitutional10 in 2016 a federal judge rejected the challenge to cordrays appointment15 the ceis challenge to the constitutionality of cfpb remains pending in the federal courts15 cei eventsedit every year cei hosts an annual dinner gala and presents the julian l simon
