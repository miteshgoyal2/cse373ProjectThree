part of the jackson 5 franchise and produced successful singles such as got to be there ben and a remake of bobby days rockin robin the jackson 5s sales however began declining in 1973 and the band members chafed under motowns strict refusal to allow them creative control or input1 although the group scored several top 40 hits including the top five disco single dancing machine and the top 20 hit i am love the jackson 5 minus jermaine jackson left motown in 19751 the jackson 5 signed a new contract with cbs records in june 1975 first joining the philadelphia international records division and then epic records1 as a result of legal proceedings the group was renamed the jacksons2 after the name change the band continued to tour internationally releasing six more albums between 1976 and 1984 during that period michael was not just the lead singer but also the chief songwriter for the group writing or cowriting such hits as shake your body down to the ground this place hotel and can you feel it3 in 1978 jackson starred as scarecrow in the film musical the wiz4 the musical scores were arranged by quincy jones who formed a partnership with jackson during the films production and agreed to produce the singers solo album off the wall5 jackson was dedicated to the role and watched videotapes of gazelles cheetahs and panthers in order to learn graceful movements for his part6 jones recalled working with jackson as one of his favorite experiences from the wiz and spoke of jacksons dedication to his role comparing his acting style to sammy davis jr6 critics panned the wiz upon its october 1978 release78 jacksons performance as the scarecrow was one of the only positively reviewed elements of the film with critics noting that jackson possessed genuine acting talent and provided the only genuinely memorable moments910 of the results of the film jackson stated i dont think it could have been any better i really dont11 in 1980 jackson stated that his time working on the wiz was my greatest experience so farill never forget that10 productionedit quincy jones produced off the wall this was the first of three successful collaborations with jackson when jackson began the off the wall project he was not sure what he wanted as the final result however he did not want another record that sounded like the jacksons but rather he wanted more creative freedom something he had not been allowed on prior albums12 jacksons father joseph also approved of the project and allowed him to record it on the condition that it didnt interfere with group business despite his brothers desire to work with him jackson wanted to make the album independently of his family1213 nevertheless his brother randy still contributed percussion to dont stop til you get enough jones produced off the wall with coproduction credit given to jackson on the songs he wrote for the album songwriters included jackson heatwaves rod temperton stevie wonder and paul mccartney14 all sessions took place at los angeles countybased recording studios rhythm tracks and vocals were recorded at allen zentz recording the horn sections contributions took place at westlake audio and string instrumentation was recorded at cherokee studios in west hollywood following the initial sessions audio mixing was handled by grammywinning engineer bruce swedien at westlake audio after which the original tapes went to the am recording studio also located in la for mastering15 swedien would later mix the recording sessions for jacksons next album and his most wellknown work 1982s thriller15 jones recalled that at first he found jackson to be very introverted shy and nonassertive16 shes out of my life had been written for jones by tom bahler three years earlier jackson heard and enjoyed it and jones allowed him to use it on the record14 jones called in heatwaves keyboardist rod temperton to write three songs the intention was for jackson and jones to select one of his songs but jackson liking them all included all of them in the final cut14 jackson stayed up all night to learn the lyrics to these songs instead of singing from a sheet he finished the vocals to these three temperton songs in two recording sessions14 temperton took a different approach to his song writing after spending some time researching the background to jacksons music style temperton mixed his traditional harmony segments with the idea of adding shorter note melodies to suit jacksons aggressive style14 jackson wrote dont stop til you get enough after humming a melody in his kitchen17 after listening to hundreds of songs jackson and jones decided upon a batch to record17 in hindsight jones believed they took a lot of risks in the production of off the wall and the final choice of album tracks14 attention was also paid to the album cover which shows jackson smiling wearing a tuxedo and trademark socks his manager stated the tuxedo was the overall plan for the off the wall project and package the tuxedo was our idea the socks were michael18 music and vocalsedit music critics stephen thomas erlewine and stephen holden of allmusic observed that off the wall was crafted from funk discopop soul soft rock jazz and pop ballads1920 prominent examples include the ballad shes out of my life the funk tune workin day and night and the disco song get on the floor20 i cant help it is a jazz piece18 in quincy jones autobiography he compares jackson to other jazz singers noting that jackson has some of the same qualities as the great jazz singers id worked with ella sinatra sassy aretha ray charles dinah each of them had that purity that strong signature sound and that open wound that pushed them to greatness shes out of my life is a melodic pop ballad17 the end of the former song showed an emotional jackson crying as the track concluded18 of the song rhythm and blues writer nelson george proclaimed it became a jackson signature similar to the way my way served frank sinatra the vulnerability verging on fragility that would become embedded in michaels persona found perhaps its richest expression in this wistful ballad5 rock with you is a romantic midtempo song17 the albums songs have a tempo ranging from 66 beats per minute on shes out of my life to 128 on workin day and night21 with the arrival of off the wall in the late 1970s jacksons abilities as a vocalist were well regarded allmusic writer stephen thomas erlewine described him as a blindingly gifted vocalist20 at the time rolling stone compared his vocals to the breathless dreamy stutter of stevie wonder their analysis was also that jacksons featherytimbered tenor is extraordinary beautiful it slides smoothly into a startling falsetto thats used very daringly22 writer journalist and biographer j randy taraborrelli expressed the opinion that jackson sings with sexy falsetto vocals in dont stop til you get enough17 releaseedit taraborrelli stated fans and industry peers alike were left with their mouths agape when off the wall was issued to the public fans proclaimed that they hadnt heard him sing with such joy and abandon since the early jackson 5 days18 on july 28 1979 off
