seats in the house 31 435 politics of the united states political parties elections the freedom caucus also known as the house freedom caucus is a congressional caucus consisting of conservative and libertarian republican members of the united states house of representatives132 it was formed in 2015 by what member jim jordan called a smaller more cohesive more agile and more active group of conservative congressmen20 many members are also part of the much larger republican study committee2021 the caucus is sympathetic to the tea party movement22 the freedom caucus is considered the farthestright grouping within the house republican conference2324 contents 1 history 11 speaker of the house john boehner resignation in 2015 12 backlash in 2016 13 rejection of american health care act in 2017 2 membership 21 chairs 22 former members 3 see also 4 references 5 external links historyedit the origins of the caucus lie at the midjanuary 2015 republican congressional retreat in hershey pennsylvania nine conservative active republican members of the house began planning a new congressional caucus separate from the republican study committee and apart from the house republican conference the group ultimately became the nine founding members and the first board of directors for the new caucus consisting of republican representatives scott garrett of new jersey jim jordan of ohio john fleming of louisiana matt salmon of arizona justin amash of michigan raúl labrador of idaho mick mulvaney of south carolina ron desantis of florida and mark meadows of north carolina25 the group debated a name for their new caucus eventually settling on house freedom caucus hfc because according to founding member mick mulvaney it was so generic and universally awful that we had no reason to be against it the group of nine founding members in hershey set as a criterion for new members that they had to be willing to vote against speaker of the united states house of representatives john boehner on legislation that the group opposed26 during the crisis over the funding of the department of homeland security in early 2015 the caucus offered four plans for resolution but all were rejected by the republican leadership one of the caucus leaders labrador of idaho said the caucus will offer an alternative that the most conservative republican members could support27needs update speaker of the house john boehner resignation in 2015edit the house freedom caucus was involved in the resignation of boehner on september 25 2015 and the ensuing leadership battle for the new speaker28 members of the caucus who had voted against boehner for speaker felt unfairly punished accusing him of cutting them off from positions in the republican study committee and depriving them of key committee assignments2930 boehner found it increasingly difficult to manage house republicans with the fierce opposition of the freedom caucus and he sparred with house republican members in 2013 over their willingness to shut down the government in order to accomplish goals such as repealing the affordable care act these members later created and became members of the freedom caucus when it was created in 201526313233 after boehner resigned as speaker kevin mccarthy the house majority leader was initially the lead contender to succeed him but the freedom caucus withheld its support34 however mccarthy withdrew from the race on september 28 201535 on the same day as mccarthys withdrawal reid ribble resigned from the freedom caucus saying he had joined to promote certain policies and could not support the role that it was playing in the leadership race36 on october 20 2015 paul ryan announced that his bid for the speaker of the united states house of representatives was contingent on an official endorsement by the freedom caucus37 while the group could not reach the 80 approval that was needed to give an official endorsement on october 21 2015 it announced that it had reached a supermajority support for ryan38 on october 29 2015 ryan succeeded john boehner as the speaker of the house39 on november 16 2015 jim jordan was reelected chairman of the caucus40 backlash in 2016edit the group faced backlash from the republican party establishment during the 2016 election cycle41 one of its members congressman tim huelskamp a tea party republican representing kansas first district was defeated during a primary election on august 2 2016 by roger marshall42 rejection of american health care act in 2017edit on march 24 2017 the american health care act ahca the house republican bill to repeal and replace the affordable care act was withdrawn by republican house speaker paul ryan because it lacked the votes to pass due in large part to opposition from freedom caucus republicans434445 two days later president donald trump publicly criticized the freedom caucus and other rightwing groups such as the club for growth and heritage action that opposed the bill trump tweeted democrats are smiling in dc that the freedom caucus with the help of club for growth and heritage have saved planned parenthood obamacare4647 on the same day congressman ted poe of texas resigned from the freedom caucus48 on march 30 2017 trump declared war on the freedom caucus sending a tweet urging republicans to fight them in the 2018 midterm elections
