and in the subsequent print edition of national review released february 15 2016 lowry and the editors of national review published an editorial11 entitled against trump which was also the cover and organizing idea of that issue a collection of articles from prominent conservatives indicating their opposition to the thencandidacy of donald trump the issue attracted significant attention and discussion from other media outlets as an early mobilization of conservatives against trumps candidacy it also garnered attention from trump himself who described the dying national review as a failing publication12 13 in the summer of 2017 when trump criticized in public the performance of attorney general jeff sessions lowry rose editorially to sessions defense trump expressed dismay over sessions earlier recusal of himself in the investigation of russian interference in the 2016 united states elections the recusal soon led to the hiring of former fbi director robert mueller as special counsel in the russian matter lowry accused trump of lacking gratitude because trump seemed to forget that sessions before he was appointed attorney general was the first senator to endorse trump for president14 he obviously doesnt feel any respect for someone who as an honorable person with a long career in public service deserves it he doesnt care about propriety which would dictate dressing down sessions in private not flaying him in public and finally he doesnt feel any obligation to sessions despite the fact that sessions gave up a safe senate seat to serve in his administration14
