counciledit further information parents television council bozell founded the parents television council in 1995 initially as a branch of the media research center focusing on entertainment television after he felt that decency was declining on primetime television programming10 the ptcs stated mission is to promote and restore responsibility and decency to the entertainment industry11 in 2001 the ptc also organized a mass advertiser boycott of the professional wrestling television program wwf smackdown over claims that the program caused the deaths of young children whom the ptc felt were influenced by watching the program in particular the ptc cited the case of lionel tate a 12yearold ft lauderdale boy who was arrested after murdering a 6yearold girl tates attorney claimed that he had accidentally killed her when he botched a professional wrestling move it was ultimately determined that the girl had been stomped to death and had not been the victim of any professional wrestling move and that the children were watching cartoons at the time the murder occurred the world wrestling federation now world wrestling entertainment or wwe would ultimately sue bozell and the ptc for libel ptcs insurance carrier eventually chose to settle the case and pay 35 million to the wwe and ptc issued a public apology12 the same year bozell and the ptc appeared as the subject of criticism in the book foley is good and the real world is faker than wrestling a memoir published by former wwf wrestler mick foley who questioned the reasoning and research that the ptc used to associate smackdown with violent acts performed by children watching the program1314 during his tenure as ptc president bozell led many campaigns derived from the ptcs stated mission to restore its view of decency to the entertainment industry among the numerous campaigns bozell has led with the ptc have included campaigning to bring back the family viewing hour15 filing complaints with the federal communications commission fcc over what he sees as indecent programs and boycotting corporations that advertise on television programs that the organization believes to be offensive among the ptcs

leading the cbs network that carried the halftime show to be fined 550000 by the fcc16 ptc filed about 65000 complaints17 and bozell was concerned that many children were likely to have been watching the halftime show as he told the associated press a few days after the show18 in fact excluding super bowlrelated complaints the vast majority of fcc complaints from 2003 to 2006 were found to have come from ptc19 responding to two columns that bozell wrote in early 20052021 san francisco chronicle columnist neva chonin claimed that bozell wanted to forbid offensive television programs not only from his views but from all our living rooms choice and taste be damned22 television watch an organization promoting parental responsibility for childrens television viewing over increased government
