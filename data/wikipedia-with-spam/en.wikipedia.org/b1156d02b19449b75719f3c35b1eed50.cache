ulan began in 1984 when the getty decided to merge and coordinate controlled vocabulary resources for use by the j paul getty trusts many automated documentation projects the art and architecture thesaurus aat was already being managed by the getty at this time and the getty attempted to respond to requests from getty projects for additional controlled vocabularies for artists names ulan and geographic names tgn in 1987 the getty created a department dedicated to compiling and distributing terminology the ulan grows and changes via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the getty vocabulary program although originally intended only for use by getty projects the broader art information community outside the getty expressed a need to use ulan for cataloging and retrieval the getty thus distributed ulan for broader use according to the tenets previously established for the construction and maintenance of the art and architecture thesaurus its scope includes names needed to catalog and retrieve information about the visual arts and architecture it is based on terminology that is current warranted for use by authoritative literary sources and validated by use in the scholarly art and architectural history community and it is compiled and edited in response to the needs of the user community originally constructed as a simple alphabetized union list of clustered artist names and biographies in order to make it consistent with the aat and getty thesaurus of geographic names in the late 1990s ulan was brought into compliance with national and international standards for thesaurus construction its scope was broadened to include corporate bodies such as architectural firms and repositories of art which may have hierarchical levels the ulan was founded under the management of eleanor fink head of what was then called the vocabulary coordination group and later director of the art history information program later called the getty information institute the ulan has been constructed over the years by numerous members of the user community and an army of dedicated editors under the supervision of several managers the ulan was published in 1994 in hardcopy union list of artist names project manager james m bower senior editor murtha baca new york gk hall 1994 and machinereadable files given the growing size and frequency of changes and additions to the ulan by 1997 it had become evident that hardcopy publication was impractical it is now published in automated formats only in both a searchable online web interface and in data files available for licensing the data for ulan is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custombuilt by getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors merging moving and publishing in various formats final editorial control of the ulan is maintained by the getty vocabulary program using wellestablished editorial rules the current managers of the ulan are patricia harpring managing editor and murtha baca head vocabulary program and digital resource management termsedit the ulan is a structured vocabulary containing around 120000 records including 293000 names and biographical and bibliographic information about artists and architects including a wealth of variant names pseudonyms and language variants designedit even though the structure is relatively flat the ulan is constructed as a hierarchical database its trees branch from a root called top of the ulan hierarchies subjectid 500000001 it currently has two published facets person and corporate body entities in the person facet typically have no children entities in the corporate body facet may branch into trees there may be multiple broader contexts
