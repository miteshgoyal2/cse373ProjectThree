president chief executive ce and managing director md2 as well as representative director rd in japan34 contents 1 responsibilities 2 characteristics 21 celebrities 3 international use 4 related positions 41 us 42 uk 5 see also 6 references 7 further reading 8 external links responsibilitiesedit the responsibilities of an organizations ceo are set by the organizations board of directors or other authority depending on the organizations legal structure they can be farreaching or quite limited and are typically enshrined in a formal delegation of authority typically responsibilities include decision maker on strategy and other key policy issues leader manager and executor the communicator role can involve speaking to the press and the rest of the outside world as well as to the organizations management and employees the decisionmaking role involves highlevel decisions about policy and strategy as a leader of the company the ceo or md advises the board of directors motivates employees and drives change within the organization as a manager the ceomd presides over the organizations daytoday operations567 the term refers to the person who makes all the key decisions regarding the company which includes all sectors and fields of the business including operations marketing business development finance human resources etc the ceo of a company is not necessarily the owner of the company characteristicsedit earlier in the century top executives were more likely to have technical degrees in science and engineering or law8 as of 2016 there were 20 female ceos of sp 500 companies approximately 49 celebritiesedit business publicists since the days of edward bernays and his client john d rockefeller and even more successfully the corporate publicists for henry ford promoted the concept of the celebrity ceo business journalists have often adopted this approach which assumes that the corporate achievements especially in the arena of manufacturing were produced by unique talented individuals especially the heroic ceo in effect journalists celebrate a ceo who takes distinctive strategic actions the model is the celebrity in entertainment sports and politics guthey et al argue that these individuals are not selfmade but rather are created by a process of widespread media exposure to the point that their actions personalities and even private lives function symbolically to represent significant dynamics and tensions prevalent in the contemporary business atmosphere10 journalism thereby exaggerates the importance of the ceo and tends to neglect the hardertodescribe broader corporate factors there is little attention to the intricately organized technical bureaucracy that actually does the work hubris sets in when the ceo internalizes the celebrity and becomes excessively selfconfident in making complex decisions indeed there may be an emphasis on the sort of decisions that attract the celebrity journalists11 international useedit in some european union countries there is a dual board system with two separate boards one executive board for the daytoday business and one supervisory board for control purposes selected by the shareholders in these countries the ceo presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board and these two roles will always be held by different people this ensures a distinction between management by the executive board and governance by the supervisory board this allows for clear lines of authority the aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person in the united states the board of directors elected by the shareholders is often equivalent to the supervisory board while the executive board may often be known as the executive committee the divisionsubsidiary heads and clevel officers that report directly to the ceo in the united states and in business the executive officers are usually the top officers of a corporation the chief executive officer ceo being the bestknown type the definition varies for instance the california corporate disclosure act defines executive officers as the five most highly compensated officers not also sitting on the board of directors in the case of a sole proprietorship an executive officer is the sole proprietor in the case of a partnership an executive officer is a managing partner senior partner or administrative partner in the case of a limited liability company executive officer is any member manager or officer related positionsedit main article corporate title typically a ceo has several subordinate executives each of whom has specific functional responsibilities referred to as senior executives12 executive officers or corporate officers subordinate executives are given different titles in different organizations but one common category of subordinate executive is the vicepresident vp an organization may have more than one vicepresident each tasked with a different area of responsibility eg vp of finance vp of human resources vp of research and development some organizations have subordinate executive officers who also have the word chief in their job title such as chief operating officer coo chief financial officer cfo and chief technology officer cto usedit in the us the term chief executive officer is used primarily in business whereas the term executive director is used primarily in the notforprofit sector these terms are generally mutually exclusive and refer to distinct legal duties and responsibilities implicit in the use of these titles is that the public not be misled and the general standard regarding their use be consistently applied ukedit in the uk chief executive and chief executive officer are used in both business and the charitable sector13 as of 2013update the use of the term director for senior charity staff is deprecated to avoid confusion with the legal duties and responsibilities associated with being a charity director or trustee which are normally nonexecutive unpaid roles in the united kingdom the term director is used instead of chief officer see
