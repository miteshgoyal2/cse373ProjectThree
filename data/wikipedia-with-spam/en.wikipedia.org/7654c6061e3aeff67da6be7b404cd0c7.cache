mobile operating system from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a mobile operating system or mobile os is an operating system for phones tablets and smartwatches or other mobile devices while computers such as typical laptops are mobile the operating systems usually used on them are not considered mobile ones as they were originally designed for desktop computers that historically did not have or need specific mobile features this distinction is becoming blurred in some newer operating systems that are hybrids made for both uses mobile operating systems combine features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use usually including and most of the following considered essential in modern mobile systems a touchscreen cellular bluetooth wifi protected access wifi global positioning system gps mobile navigation video and singleframe picture cameras speech recognition voice recorder music player near field communication and infrared blaster by the end of 2016 over 430 million smartphones were sold with 817 percent running android 179 percent running ios 03 percent running windows mobile and the other oses cover 01 percent1 android alone is more popular than the popular desktop operating system windows and in general smartphone use even without tablets outnumber desktop use desktop use web use overall is down to 449 in the first quarter of 2017 mobile devices with mobile communications abilities eg smartphones contain two mobile operating systems – the main userfacing software platform is supplemented by a second lowlevel proprietary realtime operating system which operates the radio and other hardware research has shown that these lowlevel systems may contain a range of security vulnerabilities permitting malicious base stations to gain high levels of control over the mobile device2 mobile operating systems have majority use as of 2017 measured by web use with even only the smartphones running them excluding tablets more used than any other kind of device3 thus traditional desktop os is now a minority used kind of os see usage share of operating systems however variations occur in popularity by regions while desktopminority also applies on some days in regions such as united states and united kingdom contents 1 timeline 11 pre1993 12 1993–1999 13 2000s 14
