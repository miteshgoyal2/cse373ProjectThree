references 11 see also 12 references 121 notes 122 bibliography 13 external links originsedit the term skid road dates back to the 17th century when it referred to a log road used to skid or drag logs through woods and bog3 the term was in common usage in the mid19th century and came to refer not just to the corduroy roads themselves but to logging camps and mills all along the pacific coast when a logger was fired he was sent down the skid road6 the source of the term skid road as an urban district is heavily debated and is generally identified as originating in either seattle or vancouver3 seattleedit the name skid road was in use in seattle by 1850s when the citys historic pioneer square neighborhood began to expand from its commercial core7 the district centered near the end of what is now yesler way the original skid road named after the freshly‑cut logs that were skidded downhill toward henry yesler’s mill8 henry yesler acquired land from doc maynard at a small point of land at what is today near the intersection of 1st avenue and yesler waycitation needed he also acquired a swath of land 450 feet wide from his property up first hill to a box of land about 10 acres in size full of timber spanning what is today 20th to 30th avenuescitation needed his steampowered logging mill was built in 18537 on the point of land that looked south towards a small island dennys island part of his land purchase from doc maynard that has since been filled in around and is the heart of todays pioneer square the mill operated seven days a week 24 hours per day on the waterfront7 the streets end near the mill attracted cookhouses and inexpensive hotels for itinerant workers along with several establishments that served beer and liquor7 the skid road was built on that 450 foot wide slice of land from the top of first hill to the logging mill on the pointcitation needed timber cut in nearby forests was greased and skidded down a long steeply sloping dirt road7 since the building of the mill much of what is todays seattle is the result of extensive terraforming by the local people to make the hilly landscape of seattle habitable at the time of the building of the mill it was some of the only flat land available the skid road became the demarcation line between the affluent members of seattle and the mill workers and more rowdy portion of the population9 the road became mill street and eventually yesler way but the nickname skid road was permanently associated with the district at the streets end7 vancouveredit main article downtown eastside the 100block of east

1950s skid road was commonly used to describe the more dilapidated areas in the citys downtown eastside12 which is focused on the original strip along east hastings street due to a concentration of

thronged by the unemployed and poor and the pattern of social decay became wellestablished in the 1970s the endemic alcohol and poverty problems in the area were exacerbated by the expansion of the drug trade with crack cocaine becoming highprofile in the 1980s as well as a reconcentration of the prostitution trade in the area because of the relocation of hooker strolls in conjunction with city policy for expo 86citation needed a portion of vancouvers skid row gastown has also been gentrified however it is in a difficult coexistence with the nearby impoverished downtown eastside along east hastings streetcitation needed the downtown eastside is deemed to be one of the poorest urban areas in canada13 you will find it wedged between popular tourist destinations such as downtown chinatown
