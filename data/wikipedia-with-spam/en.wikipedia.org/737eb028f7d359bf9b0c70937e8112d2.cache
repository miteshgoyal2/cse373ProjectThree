external links historyedit backgroundedit woodframe wigwam building specially designed for the 1860 republican convention in chicago by 1860 the dissolution of the whig party in america had become an accomplished fact with establishment whig politicians former free soilers and a certain number of anticatholic populists from the know nothing movement flocking to the banner of the fledgling antislavery republican party while the republican presidential effort on behalf of the 43yearold colonel john c frémont in the 1856 election had met with failure party gains were made throughout the northern united states as the sectional crisis over slavery intensified party leaders sought to hold their 1860 nominating convention in the burgeoning middle western trade center of chicago then a city of some 110000 people the city had no sufficiently large meeting hall so an appropriation was made for a temporary woodframe assembly hall – known as the wigwam – to seat ten thousand delegates guests and observers1 the rapidly designed and constructed building proved well fit for the purpose featuring excellent lines of sight and stellar acoustics allowing even an ordinary speaker to be heard throughout the room2 the convention commanded the interest and attention of a multitude of curious citizens who crowded the wigwam to the rafters delegations were seated by state and the gathering was virtually devoid of southern participation with no delegations attending from the slave states of north carolina south carolina tennessee arkansas georgia alabama mississippi louisiana and florida3 delegation voting strength was loosely based upon the size of each states congressional delegation subject to some modification by the credentials committee with the northeastern delegations of new york 70 pennsylvania 54 massachusetts 26 and new jersey 14 constituting the largest regional block surpassing the midwestern states of ohio 46 indiana 26 illinois 22 and iowa 84 some 86 votes were apportioned to the six states of new england4 slave and border states with substantial delegations under the rules but with small actual party organizations included kentucky 23 virginia 23 and missouri 184 the total of all credentialed delegate votes was 4665 daily affairsedit with the convention called to order on may 16 former us representative david wilmot of pennsylvania was elected temporary chairman of the gathering he had been the author in 1848 of the wilmot proviso which would have banned slavery from new states incorporated into the union2 upon his election wilmot delivered the keynote speech to the convention in which he declared that a great sectional and aristocratic party or interest has for years dominated with a high hand over the political affairs of this country that interest has wrested and is now wresting all the great powers of this government to the one object of the extension and nationalization of slavery it is our purpose gentlemen it is the mission of the republican party and the basis of its organization to resist this policy of a sectional interest it is our purpose and our policy to resist these new constitutional dogmas that slavery exists by virtue of the constitution wherever the banner of the union floats6 organizational tasks filled the rest of the first days activities including the appointment of a credentials committee and a resolutions committee2 there were no contested seats although a delegation purporting to represent the state of texas was ruled ineligible by the credentials committee2 a platform committee was also named including one delegate from every state and territory in attendance2 this committee began its work at once and completed its task with a report on the evening of the second day may 172 platformedit 1860 republican platform the reading of the platform as drafted by the platform committee chaired by judge william jessup of pennsylvania was received with stormy applause and an immediate move followed to adopt the document unanimously and without amendments2 an effort followed to amend the platform after adoption with insertion of famous language from the declaration of independence that all men are created equal and they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights2 this amendment was initially rejected by the convention prompting a walkout by its proposer long time ohio congressman joshua reed giddings2 the matter was hastily reconsidered by the convention and with the addition of the amendment the disgruntled mr giddings returned to his seat crisis resolved2 the 1860 republican platform consisted of 17 declarations of principle of which 10 dealt directly with the issues of free soil principles slavery the fugitive slave act and the preservation of the union while the remaining 7 dealing with other issues clauses 12 through 16 of the platform called for a protective tariff enactment of the homestead act freedom of immigration into the united states and full rights to all immigrant citizens internal improvements and the construction of a pacific railroad7 in addition to the preservation of the union all five of these additional promises were enacted by the thirtyseventh congress and implemented by abraham lincoln or the presidents who immediately succeeded him ballot countsedit drawing of the wigwam interior

adjourn the 1860 democratic national convention in charleston south carolina without a nominee and had not yet reconvened in baltimore maryland with the democrats in disarray and with a sweep of the northern states possible the republicans were confident of victory senator william h seward of new york was generally expected to get the nomination other candidates seeking the nomination at the convention included lincoln governor of ohio salmon p chase former us representative edward bates of missouri and us senator simon cameron of pennsylvania as the convention developed however it was revealed that seward chase and bates had each alienated factions of the republican party delegates were concerned that seward was too closely identified with the radical wing of the party and his moves toward the center had alienated the radicals chase a former democrat was opposed by many of the former whigs who had become republicans was thought to be too radical on slavery had opposed tariffs wanted by pennsylvania manufacturing interests and critically had opposition in his own delegation from ohio bates outlined his positions on extension of slavery into the territories and equal constitutional rights for all citizens positions that alienated his supporters in the border states and southern conservatives germanamericans in the party opposed bates because of his past association with the knownothings it was essential to carry the west what would today be considered the middle west and lincoln was a prominent westerner he had a national reputation from his debates and speeches in which he eloquently opposed slavery while avoiding any of the radical positions that could alienate moderate voters he had the support of the illinois and indiana delegations before the convention and was the strongest candidate other than seward nonetheless sewards prestige appeared likely to carry him to the nomination lincoln was represented at the convention by his friends leonard swett ward hill lamon and david davis during the night of may 17–18 they worked frantically to win antiseward delegates for lincoln they showed that lincoln already had the most support after seward which persuaded some they also made a deal with simon cameron of pennsylvania who recognized that he had no chance of winning the nomination himself cameron controlled the pennsylvania delegation and he offered to trade his support for the promise of a cabinet position for himself and control of federal patronage in pennsylvania lincoln did not want to make any such deal from springfield he telegraphed to davis i authorize no bargains and will be bound by none8 despite this restriction davis reached an understanding with cameron which eventually led to camerons appointment as secretary of war the next day may 18 when voting for the nomination began seward led on the first ballot with lincoln a distant second but on the second ballot the pennsylvania delegation switched to lincoln putting him in a neartie with seward on the third ballot many additional delegates switched to lincoln and he won the partys nomination9 candidatesedit representative abraham lincoln from
