member shortly after its founding in september 1851 initially known as the new york associated press nyap the organization faced competition from the western associated press 1862 which criticized its monopolistic news gathering and price setting practices an investigation completed in 1892 by victor lawson editor and publisher of the chicago daily news revealed that several principals of the nyap had entered into a secret agreement with united press a rival organization to share nyap news and the profits of reselling it the revelations led to the demise of the nyap and in december 1892 the western associated press was incorporated in illinois as the associated press a 1900 illinois supreme court decision inter ocean publishing co v associated press—that the ap was a public utility and
