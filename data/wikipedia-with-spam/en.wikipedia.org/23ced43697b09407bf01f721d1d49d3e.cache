leagues players players like kemp with modest nfl experience were often signed by the afl at the time33 kemp signed as a free agent with the afls los angeles chargers sid gillman era 1960–1962edit in

roommate ron mix recalled that kemp needed ten or so shots of painkillers before each game and commented that it sounds weird but he could play football and not be fit to serve in the army43 in 1962 kemp broke his middle finger two games into the season and was unable to play he persuaded his doctors to set his broken finger around a football so that his grip would not be affected once the finger healed chargers coach sid gillman put kemp on waivers to try to hide him44 buffalo bills coach lou saban noticed that kemp was available and claimed him for a 100 waiver fee on september 25 196245 in what sportswriter randy schultz has called one of the biggest bargains in professional football history29 the dallas texans and denver broncos also attempted to claim kemp but he was awarded to buffalo by afl commissioner joe foss46 lou saban era 1962–1965edit according to billy shaw kemps acquisition solved the bills quarterback problem29 but kemp was not excited about coming to buffalo according to van miller jacks a skier and he wanted to go to denver and play for the broncos he hated the thought of coming to buffalo47 in buffalo he would become known for his love of reading a broad range of books including those by henry thoreau which led to chidings from saban3 injuries including the broken finger45 kept kemp from playing for most of 1962 that season kemp received a military draft notice for service in the vietnam war but was granted a draft waiver because of a knee problem the injuries healed and kemp debuted for buffalo on november 18 1962 by directing the only touchdown drive in a 10–6 win over the oakland raiders45 he played only four games for buffalo in 1962 but made the afl allstar team45 the bills won three of their last four games to finish 7–6–148 on december 14 1962 the bills outbid the green bay packers for notre dame quarterback daryle lamonica45 in 1963 a fourseason starting quarterback battle began that continued until lamonica left for the raiders lamonica felt he  learned a lot from jack about quarterbacking and i truly believe that we were a great onetwo punch at the position for the bills29 in 1963 kemp led the bills from a slow start to a tie for the afl eastern division lead with a 7–6–1 record49 kemp again placed second in passing attempts completions and yards and he also finished second to teammate cookie gilchrist in rushing touchdowns50 the bills played the boston patriots in an eastern division playoff game to determine the division title on december 28 at war memorial stadium in buffalo new york in 10 °f −12 °c weather during the game buffalo replaced kemp with lamonica after falling behind 16–0 but still lost 26–851 kemp was said to be the clubhouse lawyer for the bills because of his role in mediating conflicts29 in 1964 he managed personalities such as gilchrist who walked off the field when plays were not being called for him and saban whom he kept from cutting gilchrist the following week29 he also managed the politics of his quarterback battle with lamonica who engineered four winning touchdown drives in the bills first seven games52 kemp was the first and only professional football player to pass for three touchdowns in the first quarter of a seasonopening game against the kansas city chiefs in 1964 until the record was tied but not broken 47 years later in 2011 by aaron rodgers5354 the 1964 team won its first nine games and went 12–2 for the regular season winning the eastern division with a final game victory over the patriots at fenway park kemp led the league in yards per attempt and finished one rushing touchdown short of the league lead which was shared by gilchrist and sid blanks55 in the afl championship game he scored the final touchdown with just over nine minutes left in a 20–7 victory56 according to lamonica the 1965 team had a new emphasis in 64 we had depended a lot on gilchrist and our running attack to carry us  but that all changed in 65 the bills had traded gilchrist in the off season to the denver broncos so we went to a passoriented game more that season than we ever had before we not only went to our receivers but we threw a lot to our running backs and i really think it brought out the best in jack that year29 in 1965 the bills finished with a 10–3–1 record57 kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions58 in the 1965 afl championship game buffalo defeated the chargers 23–0 for kemp the victory was special because it came against his former team59 kemps role in leading the bills to a repeat championship without gilchrist and with star receiver elbert dubenion playing only three games earned him a share of the afl mvp awards that he split with former charger teammate paul lowe5560 kemp also won the associated press award and the championship game most valuable player award6162 joe collier and john rauch eras 1966–1969edit following the championship game saban resigned to coach the university of

the houston oilers on august 26 collier put the bills through a 40play scrimmage during the scrimmage ron mcdole fell on kemps right knee and injured it forcing kemp to sit out the entire 1968 season67 the bills went 1–12–1 without kemp68 despite kemps return from injury and the arrival of running back o j simpson the bills only compiled a 4–10 record during the 1969 season under new coach john rauch69 kemp was named an afl allstar in 1969 for the seventh time in the leagues 10 years65 he advocated recognition of the league and in its last year 1969 lobbied pete rozelle to have afl teams wear an afl patch to honor it in 1969 the erie county republican party approached him about running for the united states congress29 after the january 17 1970 afl allstar game kemp returned home and talked to his wife before deciding to enter politics70 kemp said i had a fouryear nocut contract with the bills at the time  i figured that if i lost i could always come back and play but the fans had their say and i was elected to congress29 career summaryedit kemp led buffalo to four straight years in the afl playoffs three consecutive eastern division titles and two straight afl

representatives from 1971 to 19898384 he is as fondly remembered for his good hair and handsome looks as for his athletic prowess and political savvy85 and was described as having the charisma of the earlier jfk john f kennedy886 david rosenbaum described kemp as an independent politician who often legislated outside his committees jurisdictions and often spoke in favor of ideals and principles rather than his partys political platforms5 as a supplysider he was not a proponent of balanced budgeting and trivialized it while speaking of growth as an economic goal587 the erie county new york republicans had drafted kemp after incumbent congressman richard d mccarthy decided to run for the united states senate5 during his inaugural campaign his district was in economic malaise and the new york times described him as a john f kennedy throwback who campaigned on family values patriotism sports and defense7 upon his election to the congress in a class of sixtytwo freshmen he was one of six newcomers—along with ronald dellums bella abzug louise day hicks robert drinan and pete du pont—discussed in time the article described him as a football fan like united states president richard nixon and as the recipient of advice from white house adviser robert finch and former kemp boss herb klein nixons director of communications the nixon aides encouraged kemp to endorse the cambodian

forces in central america91 supported the gold standard spoke for civil rights legislation opposed abortion and was the first lawmaker to popularize enterprise zones5 which he supported to foster entrepreneurship and job creation and expand homeownership among public housing tenants8992 during his career he sometimes sounded like a liberal democrat7 he supported affirmative action9394 and rights for illegal immigrants95 the new york times described kemp as the most proactive combatant in the war on poverty since robert kennedy96 he differed from rockefeller republicans and earlier combatants such as lyndon johnson by supporting incentivebased systems instead of traditional social programs7 for his commitment to inner city concerns from within the republican party david gergen heralded him as a courageous voice in the wilderness97 although he was liberal on many social issues and supported civil liberties for homosexuals he opposed certain gay rights such as the right to teach in schools27 kemp at times felt his role was that of freewheeling entrepreneurial wildcatting backbencher98 time magazine identified 38yearold secondterm congressman kemp as a future leader in its 1974 faces for the future feature99 another earlycareer notable magazine appearance was in a 1978 issue of esquire14 the article explained allegations of homosexual activity among staffers in ronald reagans sacramento office in 1967 kemp was not implicated4 kemp considered running for the us senate in 1980 and hugh sidey mentioned him as a contender to unseat jimmy carter in the 1980 presidential election86 and was a front runner for the vice presidency at the 1980 republican national convention5100 where he received 43 votes from conservative detractors of george h w bush after he was reelected for a sixth term in 1980 his republican peers elected him to a party leadership position101 and he served seven years as chairman of the house republican conference3 this promotion occurred immediately after kemp and david stockman urged reagan by memorandum to dedicate his first 100 days to working on an economic package with congress102103 kemp considered running for governor of new york in 1982 but ultimately decided to stay in the house by 1984 many viewed kemp as reagans heir apparent4 uss buffalo ssn715 commissioning jack joanne and judith kemp kemp and naval officers october 25 1980 kemp had his first encounter with supplyside economics in 1976 when the wall street journals jude wanniski interviewed him at his congressional office kemp questioned wanniski all day until midnight at kemps bethesda maryland home and was eventually converted to university of southern california professor arthur laffers supplyside discipline5104 thereafter kemp espoused supplyside economics freely and in 1978 he and sen bill roth of delaware proposed taxcutting legislation5 kemp has been credited as responsible for supplyside economics inclusion in president reagans economic plan105106 although at the time of robert mundells nobel memorial prize in economics recognition some attributed much of the credit to mundell laffer robert bartley and wanniski107 in 1979 kemp wrote an american renaissance isbn 0060122838 to deliver his message that a rising tide lifts all boats108 although the realization of early 1980s tax cuts are attributed to reagan they were initiated by kemp and roth through their 1981 kemp–roth tax cut legislation5 reagans budget based on this legislation passed over the objection of united states house committee on ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski109110 during the reagan years kemp and his followers ignored budget balancing while promoting tax cuts and economic growth111112 these tax cuts have been credited by conservatives for the economic growth from 1983 to 1990113 which by 1996 had become one of the longest expansions in american history114 kemp notes that federal reserve chairman paul volckers success at stemming inflation and the favorable regulatory environment were also major factors115 detractors note that the expansion was fueled by undesirable sectors like gaming prisons medical treatment and credit card use114 an early kemp tax reform attempt was an unsuccessful 1979 proposal to index tax brackets for cost of living fluctuations116 which was incorporated in reagans 1980 package104 kemp cosponsored a legislative attempt at enterprise zones in 1980117 one of kemps more trying times as a congressman came in 1982 when reagan decided to reverse the tax cuts and promote tax increases the reversal was controversial and stimulated opposition by kemp nonetheless the revised taxes passed118119 in 1983 kemp opposed the policies of chairman volcker on multiple occasions the debates included domestic monetary involvement and roles in funding the international monetary fund120121 kemp delivered speeches at several republican national conventions he addressed the convention on july 15 at the 1980 republican national convention in detroit michigan and on august 21 at the 1984 republican national convention in dallas texas122 during the 1984 convention with trent lott as republican party platform committee chairman congressmen kemp and newt gingrich claimed control of the party platform to the consternation of gop senators bob dole and howard baker84 kemps official role was as the chairman of the platform subcommittee on foreign policy however the three platform planks that he proposed involved tax hikes the gold standard and the role of the federal reserve123 despite kemps official role his real influence as an author was on the grammatical structure of the plank on tax hikes124125 by 1985 kemp was a leading contender for the 1988 presidential nomination126 he also delivered remarks on free enterprise zones at the 1992 republican national convention in houston texas127 despite efforts and considerations of expanding his political domain kemp never held a fundraiser outside of his suburban western new york district until well into his eighth term in congress128 kemp was a critic of association football known as soccer in the united states129 in 1986 during a house floor debate over whether the united states should host the 1994 fifa world cup kemp proclaimed i think it is important for all those young out there—who someday hope to play real football where you throw it and kick it and run with it and put it in your hands—that a distinction should be made that football is democratic capitalism whereas soccer is a european socialist sport130131 kemp compared his speech to george carlins 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and american football and wrote that his tongue was firmly planted in cheek when making the speech132 despite the levity of the speech it garnered significant backlash130131 however he continued to insist that soccers main problem is it doesnt have a quarterback132 kemp noted that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claimed to have changed his position on soccer he even attended the 1994 fifa world cup with longtime soccer fan henry kissinger although he wrote during the 2006 fifa world cup that soccer can be interesting to watch but is still a boring game132 presidential bid 1988edit main article republican party presidential primaries

kemps left shoulder in 1988 if kemp had won his campaign for the united states presidency5 it would have made him the first person to move from the united states house of representatives to the white house since james garfield133 when he formed his exploratory committee he signed ed rollins reagans 1984 reelection political director as an advisor134 from the outset kemp had failed to position himself as the primary alternative to vice president bush81 except for a select few cognoscenti135 the general public did not recognize kemps leadership ability although he was a successful man of ideas81136 in fact most of the republican electorate found themselves unfamiliar with kemp early in his campaign135 political pundits recognized him however as a visionary idea man137 in addition he was quickly perceived as a verbose speaker who sometimes lost contact with his audience81 although kemp tried to appeal to conservatives his libertarian philosophies of tolerance and individual rights and his commitment to supporting minorities women bluecollar workers and organized labor clashed with conservative voters social and religious values81 to democrats kemps freemarket philosophies were a form of laissezfaire anarchy138 however as much as kemp wanted to minimize governments role he acknowledged that moves toward a more laissezfaire system should be wellthought out139 after the may 1987 gary hart–donna rice scandal a questionnaire by the new york times requested things such as psychiatric records and access to fbi files from all 14 presidential candidates candidates from each party expressed opinions on both sides of the personal privacy issue and kemp rejected the times inquiry as beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate140141 his campaign was on an early positive course with many key early endorsements in new hampshire but bush held the support of much of the republican establishment in new york4 although he had an eclectic mix of supporters kemps campaign began borrowing against anticipated federal matching funds because it had quickly spent itself into the red4 which may have been due to the use of expensive direct mail fundraising techniques142 to offset his socially moderate stances kemp clarified his opposition to abortion his support of the strategic defense initiative sdi and his support for a stronger military than that favored by secretary of state george shultz481 to position himself as reagans successor kemp called for shultzs resignation based on claims that shultz had neglected freedom fighters in afghanistan and nicaragua and had waffled on sdi143 in an attempt to highlight his stands on key reagan era foreign policy initiatives kemp traveled in september 1987 to costa rica honduras and el salvador to lobby the presidents of those nations against the arias peace plan—a peace accord us conservatives felt too conciliatory to central american communists he was accompanied on the trip by 50plus us conservative leaders144 despite a platform covering the full range of political subjects kemps primary campaign weapon was a fiscal policy based on tax cuts as part of his fiscal policy he opposed a social security benefits freeze and endorsed a freeze on government spending145 some viewed kemps supplyside stance as an attempt to ignore the national budget deficit in late 1987 political pundits saw that kemp needed to gain support from the far right on nonsocial issues146 kemp was among the majority of republican candidates in opposition to reagans inf treaty agreement with the soviet unions mikhail gorbachev despite general republican voter approval of the treaty with aspirations of support from rightwing voters all candidates with low levels of poll support for the nomination took this same sabrerattling stand147148 by early 1988 the moderates bush and dole were clearly the frontrunners and kemp was battling with pat robertson as the conservative alternative to the moderates149 he used a somewhat negative advertising campaign that seemed to have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention150 his 1988 campaign was based on the platform of supplyside economics and innercity enterprise zones8 in bare knuckles and back rooms my life in american politics campaign chairman rollins described kemp as a candidate with foibles151 kemps campaign managers say he was unmanageable he ignored timers on his speeches refused to call contributors and refused to practice for debates a humbling super tuesday in which his 39 delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and president bush and both dole and pat robertson ended his campaign58 after withdrawing from the race he was still considered a contender for the vice president nomination152 in 1989 the kemps switched their official residence from hamburg new york to bethesda maryland153 their residence at the time of his death9 in 1994 kemps 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the federal election commission by agreeing to pay 120000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for among other things excessive contributions improper direct corporate donations press overbilling exceeding spending limits in iowa and new hampshire and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation154 cabinet 1989–1993edit hud secretary kemp with sybil mobley a florida am university dean as a socalled bleedingheart conservative kemp was a logical choice for bush as the secretary of housing and urban development155 whose job would be to foster public sector and private sector methods to meet the demands of public housing156 however the scandals of reagans secretary of housing and urban development samuel pierce and the neglect of the president were obstacles from the start and kemp was unsuccessful at either of his major initiatives enacting enterprise zones and promoting public housing tenant ownership157 the goal of these two plans was to change public housing into tenantowned residences and to lure industry and business into inner cities with federal incentives158 although kemp did not affect much policy as huds director he cleaned up huds reputation157159 and developed a plan to salvage the troubled federal housing administration160 he halted or revamped corrupt programs and developed an antidrug offensive161162 which enabled him to collaborate with director of the national drug control policy bill bennett163 he supported operation clean sweep and similar movements to prohibit firearm possession in public housing162164 although kemp coaxed bush to support a 4 billion housing program that encouraged public housing tenants to buy their own apartments the democratic congress allocated only 361 million to the plan8 in addition to opposition in congress kemp fought white house budget director richard darman who opposed kemps pet project hope homeownership and opportunity for people everywhere the project involved selling public housing to its tenants darman also opposed kemps proposed welfare adjustment of government offsets96 hope was first proposed to white house chief of staff john sununu in june 1989 to create enterprise zones increase subsidies for lowincome renters expand social services for the homeless and elderly and enact tax changes to help firsttime home buyers96 sununu opposed it at first as did most of the cabinet but in august 1990 sununu at the urging of united states attorney general dick thornburgh encouraged president bush to endorse kemps economic empowerment task force however the persian gulf war and the budget negotiations overshadowed kemps new project96 darman battled kemp and his allies such as gingrich james pinkerton and vin weber96 the budget left him with 256 million for his plan which kemp increased during some appropriations battles96 soon after clayton yeutter was appointed chief white house domestic policy advisor kemps economic empowerment task force was abolished96 president bush avoided federal antipoverty issues165 and instead used kemp as a mouthpiece to speak on the administrations low priority conservative activist agenda166167 bushs contribution to the urban agenda had been volunteerism through his points of light theme168 and kemp received stronger support for his ideas from presidential candidate bill clinton169 by the time of the los angeles riots of 1992 bush was a bit late in supporting enterprise zones tenant ownership and welfare reform8 mort zuckerman compared bushs vision on racial issues to that of a man riding backwards in a railroad car170 nonetheless the riots made kemp a focal point of the administration171172 even though at first kemp had been overlooked173 however charles e schumer had probably summarized the prospects of kemps success in advance best when he said in 1989 good ideas with money can do a whole lot good ideas without money arent probably going to do a whole lot and the issue here was the decision not to fund kemps ideas108 although kemp was unable to procure money for his visions he was among the administrations leading users of first class corporate jets174 he cited lingering effects from a knee injury as the reason he had to fly first class at government expense as the housing secretary43 generally his time as housing secretary was considered unsuccessful5 however although he could not get federal funding for empowerment zones passed during his tenure by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones175 and in 1994 35 billion was approved for them under president clinton176 a free market kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses for the purpose of creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the clinton administration however177 in 1992 with h ross perot mounting a formidable campaign kemp was again considered a vice presidential candidate178179 kemp was partly at fault for not achieving either of his primary goals because he did not get along with the rest of the cabinet96 at one point kemp told james baker white house chief of staff that bushs best chance to win reelection was to dump his economic advisors in dramatic fashion180 before the 1992 republican national convention kemp and six prominent republican conservatives prepared a controversial memo urging bush to revise his economic policy181 contemporaneously conservative republicans in office and in the media such as william f buckley jr and george will felt dan quayle should be ousted in favor of kemp182 this followed kemps reference to parts of the presidents economic policy as gimmicks after the 1992 state of the union address183 kemp was respected within the party for opposing bush184 and towards the end of bushs administration insiders recognized his value185 in late 1991 81 of the 166 republican congressmen signed a letter coauthored by curt weldon and dan burton requesting that bush cede some domestic authority to kemp as a domestic policy czar184 the letter highlighting kemps energy enthusiasm and national clout insulted bush186 kemp was a bit of a surprise to stay in the bush cabinet for the duration of his presidency187 and he was described as one of the few bush administration members who would take tough stands188 kemp did not expect to be retained if the republicans were reelected in 1992189 and some pundits agreed with him185 posthud years 1993–1996edit kemp gave public speeches for 35000 apiece between his time as housing secretary and his vice presidential nomination by 1994 kemp had embarked on 241 fundraising dinners to raise 35 million for a 1996 presidential bid and to pay off his 1988 campaign debts8 after stepping down from his 189000 secretary of housing and urban development job kemp personally earned 69 million in the next three years primarily for speaking on behalf of local republican candidates95190 during the super bowl xxviii festivities kemp hosted a notable fundraiser series191 kemp was considered the star of the 1992 republican national convention192 in 1992 and 1993 kemp was considered the favorite or cofavorite for the 1996 presidential nomination193194195 at the time of the 1994 midterm elections kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996196 and his supporters wanted a formal announcement by the end of the year197 in january 1995 kemps stated reason for not entering the 1996 republican party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary republican political landscape kemp opposed term limits he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and unlike most republicans favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty198199 in 1995 gloria borger noted kemp was not in step with the 1994 contract with america200 kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a presidential campaign201 gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top republicans from running202 in 1995 while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by colin powell kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign203 senate majority leader dole and gingrich appointed kemp to head a tax reform commission the kemp commission in response to voter concern that the tax code had become too complicated204 kemp championed many issues including the flat tax90 which he formally proposed after he was appointed205206207 the proposal included some politically popular income tax deductions such as mortgage interest208 but it remained fairly general209 among the 1996 republican party candidates both steve forbes and phil gramm proposed the flat tax207210 during the campaign kemps endorsement was highly coveted211212 forbes had tried to get kemp to run in the 1996 campaign but kemp declined and in fact endorsed forbes just as dole was closing in on the nomination and just after dole gained the endorsements of former contenders lamar alexander and richard lugar8213 some feel the primary reason for the endorsement was to keep the flat tax idea and other supplyside views alive214215 many thought kemp had destroyed his own political future with the endorsement and kemp profusely apologized to doles campaign offices8 after it became clear dole would be the nominee kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with felix rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties216 kemp was also outspoken on immigration on around this time according to kemps interpretation of a scientific index that he and bennett support immigrants are a blessing not a curse217 in 1994 kemp and bennett opposed california ballot proposition 187 a measure to bar illegal immigrants from obtaining public services in direct opposition to firstterm republican california governor pete wilson one of its endorsers who was running for reelection218219 republican senate candidate michael huffington had also endorsed the proposition220 kemp supported rights for illegal immigrants and opposed lamar smith and alan simpsons proposed restrictions on legal immigration221 vice presidential nomination 1996edit main article united states presidential election 1996 bob dole and kemp were featured on the cover of time magazine but were nearly displaced by a story about mars inset on cover kemp had a reputation as the highestprofile progressive republican when dole declined an invitation to speak to the national association for the advancement of colored people he suggested kemp as a substitute even before kemp had become the vice presidential nominee222 on august 5 1996 dole announced a 15 acrosstheboard tax cut in response to both the forbes campaign and kemps tax reform commission several of doles other campaign ideas came from kemp and bill bennetts empower america which had jeane kirkpatrick weber forbes and alexander as principals for example dole borrowed kirkpatricks tough foreign policy bennetts right conduct and even alexanders school choice interest223 bennett declined the offer to be doles running mate but suggested kemp224 a man described as doles antagonist225 on august 16 1996226 the republican party chose kemp as its vice presidential nominee running alongside former senator dole kemp was seen as a means to attract conservative and libertarianminded voters like those of tough nominationchallengers forbes and pat buchanan227 kemp was chosen over connie mack john mccain and carroll campbell228 and it is assumed that this was partly because kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as doles senior advisors229 dole had had a long history of representing the budgetbalancing faction of the party while kemp had had a long history of representing the taxcutting advocates230 and kemps taxcutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket231 when kemp became doles running mate in 1996 they appeared on the cover of the august 19 1996 issue of time magazine232 but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on mars which was so close to being the cover story that time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was233 the two politicians had a storied history stemming from alternative perspectives and objectives dole was a longstanding conservative deficit hawk who had even voted against john f kennedys tax cuts while kemp was an outspoken supplysider in the early 1980s according to david stockman kemp persuaded reagan to make a 30 acrosstheboard tax cut a central 1980 presidential campaign feature once reagan was elected dole was the senate finance committee chairman who kemp claims resisted the plan every step of the way dole concedes he expressed reservations about the 1981 plan the big confrontation came after the tax plan was approved and after dole subsequently proposed tax increases that he referred to as reforms kemp was vocal in his opposition to the reforms and even penned an oped piece in the new york times which enraged dole reagan supported the reforms at doles request causing kemp to summon allies to meetings to stop the act which eventually passed in 1982234 at the 1984 republican national convention kemp along with allies such as gingrich and lott added a plank to the party platform that put president reagan on record as ruling out tax increases gingrich called this action dole proofing the platform and the plank passed over doles opposition then in 1985 dole proposed an austere budget that barely passed in the senate with appendectomy patient pete wilson casting the tying vote and vice president bush casting the deciding vote in meetings with the president that excluded dole kemp reworked the budget to exclude crucial social security cutbacks this is said to have been doles most crushing political defeat and to have contributed to the republican loss of control of the senate during the 1988 presidential election the two antagonized each other after bush won and kemp left congress for the cabinet the two did not really cross paths again until 1996 when kemp endorsed doles opponent forbes on the eve of the new york primary in march234 dole despised kemps economic theories93 but he felt kemplike tax cuts offered his best chance at electoral success235 for his part kemp had to make concessions as well he had to back expelling the children of illegal immigrants from public schools despite his longstanding opposition to proposition 187 and mute his opposition to abolishing affirmativeaction programs in california226236 some derided kemp for his compromise and referred to him as a con artist237 from the outset of their campaign dolekemp trailed238 and they faced skeptics even from within the party239 however kemp was able to use the nomination to promote his opposition to clintons partial birth abortion ban veto240 during the campaign kemp and forbes advocated for a stronger stand on tax cutting than dole used241242 however in general the opinion was that kemp was helpful to the tickets chances of catching bill clinton243244245 and kemps advocacy gave a clear picture of the tax reforms that would likely occur on the condition of a successful campaign246 kemp was seen as likely to influence several types of swing voters especially those of his native state of california230 and even the democrats feared kemp might lure voters237 after receiving the nomination kemp became the tickets spokesman for minorities and the innercity247248249 due to agreement on the selfhelp policy that louis farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the million man march kemp in a sense aligned himself with farrakhan250251 however farrakhan was perceived as being antisemitic251 and kemp was considered an ally of republican jews252 this issue necessitated some political sidestepping251 as the nominee kemp at times overshadowed dole240 in fact more than once kemp was described as if he was the presidential nominee240253 in addition to having overshadowed dole despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of footballrelated metaphors and hyperbole254 although some enjoyed kemps style referring to him as the good shepherd254 his detractors such as us news world report writer steven v roberts criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills255 during the campaign kemp expressed the opinion that republican party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly256 despite kemps voice on minority issues colin powells support and polls that showed about 30 of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer school vouchers and criminal justice the republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from africanamerican voters257 both al gore and kemp had presidential aspirations which induced pursuit of debate on a higher plane258 in addition gore and kemp were longtime friends unlike gore and his previous vice presidential opponent dan quayle thus as debaters they avoided personal attacks259 however some felt kemp failed to counter substantive attacks260 in the final october 9 1996 vice presidential debate against al gore held as the dole–kemp ticket trailed badly in the national polls kemp was soundly beaten261262 and al gores performance is considered one of the best modern debate performances263 the debate topics ranged broadly from the usual such as abortion and foreign policy to the unusual such as an incident preceding the thencurrent baseball playoffs in which roberto alomar the baltimore orioles second baseman cursed and spat on an umpire264265 the mexico policy debate was one of the more interesting topics for critical review266 the gore victory was not a surprise since kemp had been outmatched by gore in previous encounters94 and gore had a reputation as an experienced and vaunted debater267 legacyedit kemp speaks at the national press club in 2006 his legacy includes the kemp–roth tax cut of the 1980s also known as the first of two reagan tax cuts these served as the foundation of supplyside economics known as reaganomics many republicans have endorsed this laffer curve view that tax cuts spur economic growth and reduce deficits although george h w bush called this philosophy voodoo economics george w bush and his treasury secretary john w snow were believers268 kemp is also remembered alongside george wallace and william jennings bryan for influencing history by changing the direction of presidential elections despite their defeats269 in the early 21st century kemp continued to be considered along with reagan as the politician most responsible for the implementation of supplyside tax cuts and along with steve forbes as the political figure most responsible for their continued place in the marketplace of political ideas270 he has been described as a beacon of economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda271272 today he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies106273 kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right on social issues but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy274 in addition to roth he has had numerous political allies at times he collaborated with gingrich and lott on deregulation and tax cuts5275 collaborated with mccain and phil gramm on tax cuts and spending restraints276 legislated with and campaigned for joseph lieberman277 and fought poverty with james pinkerton96 pete du pont was a progressive conservative ally274 after retiring from congress and serving in the cabinet kemp remained close to gingrich lott weber and mack8200278 kemp was a member of the federal committee to promote martin luther king jr day as a national holiday243 as a progressive voter he had civil rights leaders such as benjamin hooks andrew young and coretta scott king and conservative black intellectuals like glenn c loury and robert l woodson as supporters and friends108 he boasted of having democratic friends such as william h gray iii charles b rangel and robert garcia7 ken blackwell was a deputy secretary under kemp279 during the reagan presidency when kemp was able to effect tax cutting a leading united states senate taxcutting proponent was democrat bill bradley a former basketball star280 several american football players have followed kemp to congress steve largent281 j c watts282 and heath shuler283 congressman paul ryan cites kemp as a mentor and mentioned him in his acceptance speech as the republican vicepresidential nominee in 2012284 senator arlen specter in a severe rebuke of federal governmental policy stated just one day after kemp died of cancer that kemp would still be alive if the federal government had done a better job funding cancer research285 late careeredit kemp with sue myrick phil english and mike turner c may 2004 in 1993 kemp bennett kirkpatrick and financial backer theodore forstmann cofounded the free market advocacy group empower america89286 which later merged with citizens for a sound economy to form freedom works empower america represented the populist wing of the party while avoiding divisive issues such as abortion and gay rights it promoted free markets and growth over balancing the budget and cutting the deficit287288 he resigned as cochairman of freedom works in march 2005 after the federal bureau of investigation fbi questioned his ties to samir vincent a northern virginia oil trader implicated in the un oilforfood scandal who pleaded guilty to four criminal charges including illegally acting as an unregistered lobbyist of the iraqi government of saddam hussein289 testimony about kemp became prominent in the trial290 also fbi informant richard fino tied kemp to james cosentino just weeks before the 1996 election291 by 1996 kemp had been named a director of six corporate boards he was a director for hawk corporation idt corporation cnl hotels and resorts inphonic cyrix corporation and american bankers insurance group292293 kemp briefly served on the board of oracle corporation whose

clintons international monetary fund lax policies toward south korea301 in early 1998 he was a serious contender for the 2000 united states presidential election but his campaign possibilities faltered302 and he instead endorsed eventual winner george w bush kemp continued his political advocacy for reform of taxation social security and education9 when a 1997 budget surplus was earmarked
