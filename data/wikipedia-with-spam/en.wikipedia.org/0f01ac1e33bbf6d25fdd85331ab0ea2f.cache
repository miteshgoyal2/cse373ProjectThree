together in audit bureau of circulations statements9 in 2007 it was commonly believed to be the largest paidsubscription news site on the web with 980000 paid subscribers6 since then online

journal included advertising on its front page for the first time this followed the introduction of frontpage advertising on the european and asian editions in late 200517 after presenting nearly identical frontpage layouts for half a century—always six columns with the days top stories in the first and sixth columns whats news digest in the second and third the ahed feature story in the fourth with hed being jargon for headline and themed weekly reports in the fifth column18 – the paper in 2007 decreased its broadsheet width from 15 to 12 inches while keeping the length at 22 3⁄4 inches to save newsprint costs news design consultant mario garcia collaborated on the changes dow jones said it would save us18 million a year in newsprint costs across all the wall street journal papers19 this move eliminated one column of print pushing the ahed out of its traditional location though the paper now usually includes a quirky feature story on the right side of the front page sandwiched among the lead stories the paper still uses ink dot drawings called hedcuts introduced in 1979 and originally created by kevin sprouls20 in addition to photographs a method of illustration considered a consistent visual signature of the paper the journal still heavily employs the use of caricatures notably those of ken fallin such as when peggy noonan memorialized thenrecently deceased newsman tim russert2122 the use of color photographs and graphics has become increasingly common in recent years with the addition of more lifestyle sections the daily was

corporation had violated its agreement by not notifying the committee earlier however brauchli said he believed that new owners should appoint their own editor29 a 2007 journal article quoted charges that murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past one large shareholder commented that murdoch has long expressed his personal political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations former times assistant editor fred emery remembers an incident when mr murdoch called him into his office in march 1982 and said he was considering firing times editor harold evans mr emery says he reminded mr murdoch of his promise that editors couldnt be fired without the independent directors approval god you dont take all that seriously do you mr murdoch answered according to mr emery murdoch eventually forced out evans30 in 2011 the guardian found evidence that the journal had artificially inflated its european sales numbers by paying executive learning partnership for purchasing 16 of european sales these inflated sales numbers then enabled the journal to charge similarly inflated advertising rates as the advertisers would think that they reached more readers than they actually did in addition the journal agreed to run articles featuring executive learning partnership presented as news but effectively advertising31 the case came to light after a belgian wall street journal employee gert van mol informed dow jones ceo les hinton about the questionable practice32 as a result the then wall street journal europe ceo and publisher andrew langhoff was fired

further information the wall street journal editorial board the journal won its first two pulitzer prizes for editorial writing in 1947 and 1953 subsequent pulitzer prizes have been awarded for editorial writing to robert l bartley in 1980 and joseph rago in 2011 for criticism to manuela hoelterhoff in 1983 and joe morgenstern in 2005 and for commentary to vermont royster in 1984 paul gigot in 2000 dorothy rabinowitz in 2001 bret stephens in 2013 and peggy noonan in 2017 two summaries published in 1995 by the progressive blog fairness and accuracy in reporting and in 1996 by the columbia journalism review45 criticized the journals editorial page for inaccuracy during the 1980s and 1990s the journal describes the history of its editorials they are united by the mantra free markets and free people the principles if you will marked in the watershed year of 1776 by thomas jeffersons declaration of independence and adam smiths wealth of nations so over the past century and into the next the journal stands for free trade and sound money against confiscatory taxation and the ukases of kings and other collectivists and for individual autonomy against dictators bullies and even the tempers of momentary majorities if these principles sound unexceptionable in theory applying them to current issues is often unfashionable and controversialcitation needed its historical position was much the same as former editor william h grimes wrote in 1951 on our editorial page we make no pretense of walking down the middle of the road our comments and interpretations are made from a definite point of view we believe in the individual in his wisdom and his decency we oppose all infringements on individual rights whether they stem from attempts at private monopoly labor union monopoly or from an overgrowing government people will say we are conservative or even reactionary we are not much interested in labels but if we were to choose one we would say we are radical just as radical as the christian doctrine46 every thanksgiving the editorial page prints two famous articles that have appeared there since 1961 the first is titled the desolate wilderness and describes what the pilgrims saw when they arrived at the plymouth colony the second is titled and the fair land and describes the bounty of america it was written by a former editor vermont c royster whose christmas article in hoc anno domini has appeared every december 25 since 1949 economic viewsedit during the reagan administration the newspapers editorial page was particularly influential as the leading voice for supplyside economics under the editorship of robert bartley it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the laffer curve and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and the capital gains tax could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity in the economic argument of exchange rate regimes one of the most divisive issues among economists the journal has a tendency to support fixed exchange rates over floating exchange rates for example the journal was a major supporter of the chinese yuans peg to the dollar and strongly disagreed with american politicians who criticized the chinese government about the peg it opposed chinas move to let the yuan gradually float arguing that the fixed rate benefited both the united states and china the journals views compare with those of the british publication the economist with its emphasis on free marketscitation needed however the journal demonstrates important distinctions from european business newspapers most particularly in regard to the relative significance of and causes of the american budget deficit the journal generally points to the lack of foreign growth while business journals in europe and asia blame the low savings rate and concordant high borrowing rate in the united states political stanceedit mark rutte prime minister of the nederlands being interviewed the wall street journal the journals editorial pages and columns run separately from the news pages are highly influential in american conservative circles as editors of the editorial page vermont c royster served 1958–1971 and robert l bartley served 1972–2000 were especially influential in providing a conservative interpretation of the news on a daily basis47 some of the journals former reporters claim that the paper has adopted a more conservative tone since rupert murdochs purchase48 the editorial board has long argued for a probusiness immigration policy in a july 3 1984 editorial the board wrote if washington still wants to do something about immigration we propose a fiveword constitutional amendment there shall be open borders this stand on immigration reform places the journal in contrast to most conservative activists politicians and media publications for example national review and the washington times who favor heightened restrictions on immigration49 the journals editorial page has been seen as critical of many aspects of barack obamas presidency in particular it has been a prominent critic of the affordable care act legislation passed in 2010 and has featured many opinion columns attacking various aspects of the bill50 the journals editorial page has also criticized the obama administrations energy policies and foreign policy515253 the editorial board of the wall street journal tends to reject widely held views on climate change—namely that it poses a major threat to human existence is largely caused by fossil fuel emissions and can be prevented through public policy the journal is regarded as a forum for climate change skeptics5455 publishing articles by scientists skeptical of the consensus position on climate change in its oped section including several essays by richard lindzen of mit565758 similarly the journal has been accused of refusing to publish opinions of scientists which present the mainstream view on climate change59 according to a 2016 analysis 14 of the guest editorials presented the results of mainstream climate science while the majority did not also none of 201 editorials published in the wsj since 1997 concede that the burning of fossil fuels was causing climate change60 a 2015 study found the wall street journal was the newspaper that was least likely to present negative effects of global warming among several newspapers it was also the most likely to present negative economic framing when discussing climate change mitigation policies61 tending to taking the stance that the cost of such policies generally outweighs their benefit on october 25 2017 the editorial board called for special counsel robert mueller to resign from the investigation into russian interference in the 2016 united states elections and accused hillary clintons 2016 presidential campaign of colluding with russia62 bias in news pagesedit the journals editors stress the independence and impartiality of their reporters28 in a 2004 study tim groseclose and jeff milyo argue the journals news pages have a proliberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks they calculated the ideological attitude of news reports in 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular think tanks and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks they found that the news reporting of the journal was the most liberal more liberal than npr or the new york times the study did not factor in editorials63 mark liberman criticized the model used to calculate bias in the study and argued that the model unequally affected liberals and conservatives and that the model starts with a very peculiar assumption about the relationship between political opinion and the choice of authorities to cite the authors assume that think tank ideology only matters to liberals64 the companys planned and eventual acquisition by news corp in 2007 led to significant media criticism and discussion65 about whether the news pages would exhibit a rightward slant under rupert murdoch an august 1 editorial responded to the questions by asserting that murdoch intended to maintain the values and integrity of the journal66 notable stories and pulitzer prizesedit the journal has won more than 30 pulitzer prizes in its history staff journalists who led some of the

emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 world trade center bombing the paper was on the stands the next day albeit in scaleddown form perhaps the most compelling story in that days edition
