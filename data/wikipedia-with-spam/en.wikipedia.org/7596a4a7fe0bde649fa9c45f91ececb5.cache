events 4 gallery 5 see also 6 references 7 external links designedit columbia center was designed by washington architect chester l lindsey9 the base of the building is clad in rosa purino carnelian granite the buildings structure is composed of three geometric concave facades with two setbacks causing the building to appear like three towers standing side by side10 ground level elevation on the fifth avenue side of the building is higher than on the fourth avenue side the part of cherry street it faces was identified as one of the steepest streets in the central business district with a slope of 17111 the tower was originally designed to be about 3065 m 1006 ft but federal regulations by the federal aviation administration faa would not allow it to be that tall so close to the nearby seatac airport although city land use regulations at the time were intended to limit skyscrapers to about 50 stories the developer martin selig obtained the necessary permits for a 76story skyscraper due to a part of the law that allowed bonus height for providing retail space with street access because three separate stories could access the street on the sloped site the developers were allowed a bonus for each of the three stories they set aside for retail which was reportedly an unintended loophole in the law1213 there is an observation deck on the 73rd floor which offers views of seattle and environs the top two floors of the building 75th and 76th are occupied by the private columbia tower club which houses a restaurant bar library and meeting rooms the 40th floor is accessible to the public and features a starbucks cafe14 an underground concourse connects the building to the nearby seattle municipal tower and bank of america fifth avenue plaza the tower originally proposed as columbia center opened under the name columbia seafirst center after its largest tenant and financier seafirst bank and then changed to the bank of america tower when seafirst which had been owned by bank of america since 1983 was fully integrated into bank of america that name gave it the nickname boat bank of america tower in november 2005 the buildings name was changed back to columbia center after the bank reduced its presence in the building bank of america still maintains office space within the building but has since closed the bank branch at the base of the tower15 historyedit development and constructionedit martin selig a local real estate developer who had recently opened the fourth and blanchard building announced plans for a 75story office building at 4th avenue and columbia street in october 1980 the 120 million project named the columbia center would be funded by the seafirst mortgage company and constructed by howard s wright1617 selig borrowed 205 million in 1981 to develop the property13 the columbia seafirst center as it came to be known was constructed by howard s wright starting in 1982 with a 120 feet deep excavation hole that required 225000cubicyards of dirt and soil to be removed this was among one of the largest foundations for a building in seattle along with concrete footings extending 134 feet below street level however the structural steel of the building was built at a rate of 2 floors per week then the building itself was completed on january 12 198510 and opened on march 2 of that same year9 us steel corporation was contracted to provide 16000 short tons 15000 t of steel for construction18 it was approximately 50 taller than the previous tallest skyscraper in seattle the 630foot 190 m seattle first national bank building now safeco plaza that opened in 1969 the columbia center then columbia seafirst center under construction circa 1984 financial problems and controversyedit selig continued to own and manage the building until 1989 when financial problems forced him to sell it to seafirst corporation for 354 million19 management was taken over by the tishman west company of los angeles20 controversy regarding the skyscrapers size contributed to the passage of a 1989 law called the citizens alternative plan cap that enforced more stringent restrictions on the size of buildings in downtown seattle21 in 1990 after rejecting earlier plans for 300foot 91 m antennas22 seattle and the faa granted permission to erect two 192foot 59 m antennas on top of columbia center which were expected to be used for broadcasting radio and television throughout the region23 though the faa was originally worried about the towers height encroaching the airspace they deemed the addition of the antennas not problematic23 the antennas were not built before the permits expired in 1994 however24 overtime purchases of the buildingedit equity office properties bought columbia center from seafirst in 1998 for 404 million25 the new york state common retirement fund bought a 499 stake in the building and then several years later sold its share back to equity office2627 in 2007 columbia center was sold by
